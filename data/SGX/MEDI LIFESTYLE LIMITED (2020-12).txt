In 2020, Medi Lifestyle Limited (“Medi Lifestyle”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), 

formerly known as IEV Holdings Limited (“IEV”), completed its transformation from an oil and gas 

engineering services provider to become a healthcare, postpartum care, and wellness provider.

The Group currently has 2 postpartum care centres in Malaysia and 1 in Singapore, as well as 1 

chiropractic and physiology centre in Malaysia.

The Group is focused on providing high quality healthcare services in Asia, starting with postpartum 

care. The Group continuously reviews its plans and strategies, and is currently also seeking out 

businesses in the arena of aesthetics, wellness, and physiology.

As part of its transformation, the Group completed the sale of IEV Group Sdn. Bhd. and its subsidiaries 

on 25 November 2020.

The Group has commenced the process to strike-off the remaining subsidiary in relation to IEV’s oil 

and gas engineering business, namely IEV Energy Investment Pte. Ltd. This process is expected to be 

completed within the financial year ending 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”).

The Group (starting with its incarnation as IEV) was listed on the Catalist Board of SGX-ST in 2011. It 

is currently headquartered in Singapore.

This is the first annual sustainability report (“Report”) for the Group as Medi Lifestyle.

This Report will serve as a point of reference and baseline for Medi Lifestyle’s journey, charting how 

it identifies the key sustainability challenges that it faces in its day-to-day operations, how it has 

responded to such challenges, and where it will position itself in future to minimise challenges and 

capitalise on opportunities.

The Report also covers the evolution and transition of the Group from operating in the oil and gas 

space into a healthcare and wellness provider, including how the Board and Management worked 

towards ensuring a seamless transition to minimise negative impact. The Report also covers and 

describes the sustainability efforts by Medi Lifestyle and IEV as distinct sets of businesses, including 

whether previous targets set for IEV have been met. However, no new targets have been set for 

material factors in relation to IEV’s business in view of the Group’s discontinuance in the oil and gas 

engineering business.

This Report covers economic, environmental, social, and governance (“EESG”) related factors identified 

for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”).

The Group strives to proactively improve on sustainability efforts by conducting annual materiality 

assessments that identify EESG issues of particular interest to our stakeholders. These assessments 

help us ensure our operations reflect and adapt to any changes in business priorities and prevailing 

events, while supporting our commitment to maintaining environmentally and socially sustainable 

business practices.

Dear Shareholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about massive disruption to many lives and economies. In 

doing so, the pandemic has highlighted the gaps and opportunities in modern healthcare systems 

as stretched resources and unparalleled demands forced accelerated change to alleviate the world’s 

healthcare needs.

Early on, we had identified the opportunities in the healthcare sector and redirected focus to the sector 

in a bid to minimise our exposure and investment in oil and gas engineering. In 2020, we accelerated 

our restructuring initiatives and moved towards completing the process of divesting fully our oil and 

gas engineering business. By end-2021, we aim to be a full-fledged healthcare and wellness group, 

putting us in a good position to capitalise on the rising demand for professional healthcare services.

We are mindful of the impacts these extensive changes will have on our employees, and have put in 

place various measures to ensure negative impacts are minimised or mitigated. At the same time, we 

have welcomed on board new employees and advisors who will install the necessary sustainability 

safeguards as we embark on our healthcare journey. In particular, we established an Advisory Panel 

in 2020 to provide strategic advice on our healthcare, postpartum care, and wellness business. The 

panel comprises of expert practitioners in their respective fields and whose industry experience and 

insights will help us make the right decisions in developing our business.

Moving forward, we are cautiously optimistic – we anticipate rising demand for our postpartum 

services in Singapore as COVID-19 restrictions limit the number of live-in confinement nannies from 

Malaysia and costs for such nannies are expected to rise, but such restrictions have also delayed 

construction work on our centres. We continue to closely monitor the situation and will adjust our 

strategies to capitalise on opportunities and mitigate challenges.

As we continue our battle against the pandemic in the months ahead, we put heed in collecting reliable 

and accurate data about our work, and in publishing such data for the purpose of transparency and 

transformation. This is at the core of our belief in sustainability – that only by being forthright about 

our strengths and weaknesses can we build a resilient and dependable business.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Our suppliers and partners are integral to our ability to run our business. They are involved in numerous 

aspects of our operations, from logistics to engineering and IT. As such, we aim to work with those 

that conduct themselves in an economically, environmentally, and socially-responsible manner.

In FY2020, IEV spent RM1.68 million on goods and services from its vendors. IEV’s approach is to 

source products/materials and services through a multi-layered procurement process that is vetted at 

various levels of IEV management. We review, among others, potential vendors’ industry reputation, 

track record, work ethics and assess them for a fit with our philosophy and strategy.

For non-proprietary products and services that IEV procures, such as diamond-wire cutting and 

microcrystalline wax-based anti-corrosion tape, we source the equipment and materials from our 

Principals in the USA.  The nature of these Principal-owned technology does not allow us to source 

any comparable equipment or material locally. Equipment and tools for cutting services and anti-

corrosion waxtape application are stored in supply base locations in the Asia-Pacific region, in 

proximity to where clients may require such services.  Materials for these services are procured from 

the USA and shipped to these supply bases as and when projects are undertaken. When mobilised by 

the client, such equipment and materials are then moved to a port for embarkation on a vessel and 

transported to an offshore location where the service is rendered or materials applied. 

For IEV’s proprietary marine growth control technology, individual components are manufactured 

using custom moulds through a selected panel of injection-die manufacturers.  These components 

are stored at IEV’s own manufacturing facility, where we prepare the marine growth control products 

according to client specifications.  The semi-assembled pieces are then freighted to and assembled at 

the client’s destination location, be it at a fabrication yard, jetty, or on an offshore platform.

Medi Lifestyle has begun to integrate sustainable business practices throughout its supply chain, and 

we aim to continuously improve on that commitment. As a start, our vendor selection process assesses 

suppliers against key criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services, and market 

reputation. We also consider the sustainability efforts taken by our vendors in areas we have deemed 

important such as ethical conduct, health and workplace safety, and environmental management. 

In FY2020, Medi Lifestyle spent RM0.67 million on goods and services from 86 suppliers. Throughout 

our engagement with suppliers, we assess and monitor their procedures, and if needed, ensure training 

is provided to meet our standards. 

Medi Lifestyle primarily sources goods and products that consist of fresh market produce and 

traditional Chinese herbs and preparations, which are supplied by reputable wholesalers. As fresh 

produce is sourced from wholesalers that supply to retail customers and commercial kitchens, such 

fresh produce is generally assumed to be safe. There is no established protocol for testing fresh 

produce. For Chinese herbs and preparations, as they are sourced from reputable wholesalers who 

supply to the general market, they are assumed to be safe as well. However, there is no industry 

protocol to test for toxins and heavy metals except for what have already been declared by importers. 

We also prepare our concoctions in small batches, enough for a maximum of 10 mothers at a time. 

Such quantities of fresh produce and Chinese herbs and preparations would be too small to justify 

individual ingredient testing.

Medi Lifestyle sources suppliers mainly from the countries we operate in such as Malaysia and 

Singapore. For IEV, we source from countries where we previously had a presence and where we 

have maintained business relationships with local suppliers such as in India.


Medi Lifestyle Limited

The Group relies on a robust and rigorous process of stakeholder engagement to understand the 

expectations and needs of its stakeholders. We believe this process allows us to continuously learn 

about what we are doing right (and wrong), how we are impacting those we work with, and how and 

where we can improve. This, we believe, strengthens our accountability to, and builds trust with, our 

stakeholders.

Our stakeholder engagement process involves talking to and opening communication channels with 

various groups and individuals to understand specific concerns about our business and its impacts. 

These include, but are not limited to: internal stakeholders such as employees, managers, senior 

management, and Board of Directors; and external stakeholders such as suppliers, regulators, 

creditors, shareholders, and customers.

We gather opinions and advice in various ways including formal and informal meetings, surveys, site 

visits, and feedback channels. These opinions and advice are then incorporated into our corporate 

strategies to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

• Economic performance

Direct economic value generated and distributed

The Group believes financial sustainability is critical to our survival and business progression. We 

aim to ensure long-term profitability by taking into account the interests of all stakeholders, such 

as employees, shareholders, suppliers, and society as a whole; minimise risk by identifying early 

opportunities and obstacles and putting in place clear measures that maximise opportunities and 

mitigate obstacles; and adhere to laws and regulations that protect and enhance employee welfare.

Continuing weakness in oil and gas prices, as well as diminishing opportunities in the industry, led us 

to accelerate our restructuring initiatives that started during the financial year ended 31 December 

2019 (“FY2019”) and start fully divesting our oil and gas engineering business in FY2020. The 

Group stepped up its efforts in pursuing opportunities in the healthcare and wellness space and had 

identified locations for another 2 postpartum centres, 1 in Singapore and 1 in Malaysia, both of which 

are currently undergoing renovation works. 

The Group’s engineering business was reclassified under discontinued operations after receiving 

shareholders’ approval in an extraordinary general meeting on 15 October 2020 to dispose of IEV 

Group Sdn Bhd. For FY2020, a profit after tax of RM7.7 million from discontinued operations was 

recorded compared to RM4.0 million in FY2019, due mainly to a gain on the disposal of IEV Group 

Sdn. Bhd.

Revenue for FY2020, being the first full financial year to record revenue only from our healthcare 

business, was RM623,000. In FY2019, the Group recorded marginal revenue of RM28,000 from 

our healthcare arm as the Group had only completed the acquisition of its first healthcare-related 

business, Lady Paradise (M) Sdn Bhd (now known as Healthpro Life Sdn Bhd), in December 2019. 

Revenue for FY2020 has been lower than expected due to construction delays and reduced business 

activities arising from the government-mandated lockdowns and restrictions in movements to address 

the COVID-19 outbreak.

ECONOMIC

We anticipate that demand for our postpartum centres will rise as parents embrace centres to care 

for their newborns over traditional confinement services. Due to COVID-19 related restrictions, 

Singapore parents now have to look for local alternatives to experienced nannies from Malaysia as 

border controls make it harder for the latter to enter Singapore and/or have made their entry costly.

As we make strides in the postpartum care business, we are also concurrently looking to expand 

into complementary and new revenue streams in the aesthetics, wellness, and physiology sectors. In 

November 2020, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary named Back to Life Sdn Bhd, which will 

be used as the operating vehicle to offer services related to alternative medicine (including, but not 

limited to Traditional Chinese Medicine), chiropractic, and physiotherapy services. 

For a more detailed look at our financial results, please refer to the following sections in our Annual 

Report 2020:

Operations assessed for risks related to corruption

The Group operates across different countries and engages numerous contractors, suppliers, agents, 

and other partners. This exposes us to numerous vulnerable points for corruption. Preventing and 

managing risks associated with corrupt practices is therefore a material factor.

As corruption is considered a major risk factor in the Group’s overall risk assessment, the Group’s 

accounting and procurement practices are consistently scrutinised and audited by external and 

internal auditors to monitor and maintain corruption-free practices. Each year, the auditors assess any 

gaps or lapses to evaluate if improper payments or procedures have been conducted. For example, 

transactions that can be viewed as having been transacted with interested or related parties will be 

reviewed by external auditors and are also reported to the Group’s Audit Committee. The external 

auditors and the Audit Committee will then assess whether the transactions complied with legal and 

company procedures and if the transactions were against the Group’s interests.

The Group also mitigates any potential risk of corruption that may arise by centralising its Accounting, 

Finance, and Supply Chain Management departments at the Group’s office in Malaysia, where the 

majority of the Group’s Operations and Senior Management teams are based.

We also have in place a whistle-blowing policy that supports our anti-corruption commitment by 

enabling employees to, in confidence, raise concerns internally and disclose any impropriety through 

well-defined and accessible channels. Should there be any reported impropriety, we have a committee 

that conducts independent investigations and enacts appropriate follow-up actions where necessary. 

In addition, we have included reviews of whistle-blowing cases as permanent fixtures of our quarterly 

Group Audit Committee meetings. During these meetings, every senior management staff member, 

which includes Directors, CEO, and CFO, must declare whether they have received any reports of 

malpractice.


Medi Lifestyle Limited

    14

We prevent and manage corruption risks with a zero-tolerance policy toward accepting any gifts 

or favours from individuals, organisation, vendors, or contractors doing or seeking to do business 

with the Group. Senior management has been tasked with ensuring the appropriate controls and 

monitoring systems have been put in place to prevent improper payments/bribery/corrupt practices. 

Also, all Director-level staff members are required to attend an SGX-mandated Director Training 

Programme that includes sessions on risk management and internal controls, with an emphasis on 

identifying and rectifying control deficiencies, fraud, money laundering, and processes for improving 

whistle blowing channels.

Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures

Our policies are communicated to all employees, including our Board of Directors and senior 

management, in all countries we operate in and can be accessed easily via our company intranet. 

As part of our induction programme when any new personnel joins the organisation, we instil in them 

the Group’s anti-corruption policies and procedures including no-gifts and whistle-blowing.

We also notify our employees on changes to such policies via internal notices and emails. Our 

employees are also encouraged to consult or seek clarification from HR and Senior Management 

personnel who have been designated to manage whistle blowing channels.

The Group’s anti-corruption policies are described in our annual Sustainability Report, which the 

general public can access online. Our business partners and suppliers are encouraged to access the 

Report in order to understand our policies better and ensure they abide by them. We also expect our 

people to adhere to such policies when interacting with business partners and to clarify to the latter 

our policies should anything be unclear.

Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken

We achieved the target of zero incidents of corruption in FY2020. We aim to maintain zero incidents 

of corruption in the next financial year. No whistle blowing reports were lodged in FY2020.

ENVIRONMENTAL

• Waste

Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts

This is a material factor for IEV, and the Group regularly assesses how materials move into, through, 

and out of our companies. We do this to understand where these materials eventually become waste. 

Such assessments provide an overview of waste generation and its causes, which in turn can support 

us in identifying how we can prevent waste and adopt circularity measures. We believe this will allow 

us to go beyond mitigating and remediating negative impacts once waste has been generated and 

move towards managing waste as a resource.

Previous generations of IEV’s marine growth control products tend to reach the end of their service life 

when their anti-fouling coating loses its efficacy, which is usually after five years. Our recommendation 

to clients is for these products to be removed and replaced by a new set of marine growth control 

products. As our products are made of high-density poly-ethylene, they can be recycled like any 

plastic material. 

We have since improved our latest generation of products by making them self-cleaning, which 

negates the requirement for an anti-fouling coating and therefore extends its service life beyond five 

years.  

In typhoon prone or icy ocean conditions, there is a risk that IEV’s marine growth control products 

installed on offshore structures may, after a prolonged period, break apart or detach from the 

structures and drift into the open sea.  Before the latest generation of products, we have avoided 

installing our products in locations prone to extreme weather conditions.

In order to market our products in locations with extreme weather conditions, our latest generation 

of marine growth control products have been developed to be stronger such that it can withstand 

extreme storm conditions.  

To support such efficacy claims, various tests have been conducted by an external agency, designed 

to see if our products can withstand typhoons and other severe ocean conditions.

The initial tests revealed that our Single Ring product can withstand winds and ocean conditions up 

to Beaufort force 10 without any damage, while our Multiple Ring can withstand up to Beaufort force 

12 without any damage. The Beaufort scale measures wind speeds and relates them to observed 

conditions at sea or on land, with the maximum, force 12, denoting typhoon force winds and conditions. 

Our products have also passed external tests conducted to determine their endurance in repeated 

height drops to simulate extreme wave conditions.

In addition, to ensure IEV’s products perform consistently, we test third-party materials and parts for 

quality and performance before accepting any batch for use in the manufacture of our products. We 

then conduct Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) tests at the production stage to ensure 

only the best materials are installed on our clients’ offshore structures. We take these processes 

seriously as using sub-standard materials or not complying with QA/QC could result in product 

performance failure or the products detaching from the offshore structures. IEV can prevent incurring 

significant financial and reputational costs by successfully identifying and replacing defective products 

at key intervals of our operations and before the products reach our clients.


Medi Lifestyle Limited

    16

Downstream, IEV’s engineering service staff work with our clients’ licenced field operators that manage 

and dispose any waste generated. These field operators are subject to their company’s environmental 

regulations, which dictate that, apart from any materials that are permitted to be injected back into 

the well or flared, other materials have to be brought back onshore for proper disposal or recycling.

Management of significant waste-related impacts

IEV aims to assist our clients in recovering structures that have been decommissioned. This will allow 

us to better plan for the end-of-life of our products with our clients and moving forward, facilitate 

a cradle-to-cradle philosophy where our products, once decommissioned, are recycled. However, in 

FY2020, none of our clients requested for decommissioning services as their structures are still in 

prime working condition.

IEV’s current generation of marine growth control products are self-cleaning and no longer need 

anti-fouling marine paint. This means that IEV’s waste is mostly plastic offcuts produced during the 

manufacturing of our products and discontinued plastic components of previous generations of 

marine growth control products. We abide by Malaysia’s Environment Quality Act of 1974, which 

requires us to recycle the waste at periodic schedules. We produced 3,677 kilograms of plastic waste 

in FY2020. 

We will store the plastic waste, which does not pose any environmental hazard in its current state, 

on our premises until enough is accumulated to make it cost effective for us to recycle. For FY2020, 

we contracted a professional waste recovery and recycling company, Famous Phase Sdn Bhd, to 

treat and recycle our plastic waste using the latest technology. We have also ascertained that the 

company’s processes and methods follow local laws and regulations.

We maintain a centralised database, which incorporates online data entry, of the amount of waste 

we generate. While we do not include the waste generated by our clients as part of our waste 

database, we recommend clients engage us when removing or dismantling our products so we can 

assist in transporting, recovering, and disposing of such items. At the same time, this helps us remain 

accountable for the products we sell and aids the execution of our commitment to circularity.

We also declare to Malaysia’s Department of Environment the amount of waste IEV generates and 

which recycling company we have appointed to handle the waste.

• Environmental compliance

Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations

This is a material factor for IEV. The Group believes in reducing our footprint and impact to as low as 

reasonably practicable. As such, we support the precautionary principle and aim to avoid negative 

impacts on the environment where feasible. To this end, we aim to ensure all risks generated from our 

operations are identified, assessed, and mitigated to a reasonably practicable level.

The Group achieved its target set for FY2020 of no incidences of non-compliance with laws and 

regulations that resulted in significant fines or sanctions.

SOCIAL

• Labour and management relations

Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes

The Group believes that promoting an environment of collaboration, understanding, and mutual trust 

among employees is important in preventing conflicts and deteriorating relations.

When a company has to undergo significant operational changes, timely and meaningful consultation 

allows affected parties to understand the impact of the changes and gain mutual trust between 

parties. It also allows the Group sufficient opportunity to work with affected parties to avoid or 

mitigate negative impacts as much as possible.

The Group believes that continuous consultation is the cornerstone for implementing significant 

operational changes. This involves management taking the views of employees into account when 

making specific decisions. The Group also believes genuine consultation involves face-to-face 

dialogue and endeavours to provide employees with sufficient information in a timely manner.

FY2020, as in previous years, proved significant in how we managed our people’s expectations and 

needs as the prolonged downturn in the global oil and gas industry forced us to dispose of all our loss-

making and/or underperforming subsidiaries. To ensure the livelihoods of its employees, the Group 

ensured that all staff and employees of the disposed entities were retained by the buyer of the said 

entities, who are related parties to the Group.

While the Group does not have a prescribed minimum notice period for informing staff of significant 

operational changes, management conducted town hall meetings with affected staff to discuss 

operational changes at least two weeks before they were to be implemented.

• Occupational health and safety

Occupational health and safety management system

IEV considers this a material factor as providing engineering services to offshore and onshore oil 

facilities carries a certain degree of risk that requires the installation of carefully calibrated processes 

to minimise injury and danger. As such, occupational health and safety (“OHS”) is of great importance 

to IEV and we have put in place robust systems for engendering a safety culture that goes beyond 

compliance to one where our people feel listened to, cared for, and comfortable raising concerns.

As a basic requirement, IEV adheres to applicable health and safety laws in the countries where 

we operate. These laws include, in particular, Malaysia’s Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994, 

Factory &amp; Machinery Act 1976, and Environmental Quality Act 1974. IEV’s manufacturing facility is 

based in Malaysia. Other country offices manage sales and marketing operations and do not produce 

industrial waste but nevertheless abide by laws imposed by their respective governments.

IEV has also put in place an integrated health and safety culture that runs throughout all levels of 

our organisation. IEV believes putting in place proper training and effective communication and 

consultation can ensure all accidents and incidents are preventable. 


Medi Lifestyle Limited

    18

IEV’s OHS is managed by the Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (“QHSE”) department. This 

department is led by a QHSE Manager, who is responsible for ensuring the management system is 

established, updated, and maintained according to local and international standards and requirements. 

Also, IEV’s OHS management system is implemented in reference to ISO 45001:2018 standard. IEV 

strives to continually improve on the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the OHS management 

system by ensuring that we have put in place numerous checks and communication channels for 

identifying and rectifying hazards and risks. These checks and communication channels will be 

elaborated upon further in the next sections.

Hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation

IEV’s dedicated QHSE department ensures health and safety practices are carried out across all our 

operations from corporate to manufacturing and engineering services. Before embarking on any 

engineering service work, IEV’s project management team will conduct a job safety induction. In 

addition, we conduct a job hazard analysis, which dissects the job procedure by procedure to identify 

existing as well as potential hazards, prioritise corrective actions, and reduce/eliminate the hazards.

IEV’s whistle-blowing policy supports our health and safety commitment by enabling employees 

to, in confidence, raise concerns internally and disclose any impropriety through well-defined and 

accessible channels. Our people need not fear reprisal for reporting any shortfalls in our health and 

safety practices. 

Should employees view an activity to be a potential hazard, IEV has a “Stop Work” policy, which can 

be exercised by any employee, regardless of position, seniority, or discipline. We do not apportion 

blame or fault on any employee who calls for a “Stop Work” order even if, upon investigation, the 

“Stop Work” order was deemed unnecessary. Work that has ceased due to a “Stop Work” order 

resumes only after all safety checks have been conducted.

When investigating incidents, IEV has a reporting process that must be completed within 12 hours 

for incidents involving a fatality, within 24 hours for loss time incidents (“LTI”), and a maximum of 

48 hours for incidents involving medical treatment or the application of first aid. This involves filling 

up a “Work Incident Report” form and submitting the form to the immediate supervisor. Within the 

same time periods (12 hours for fatal incidents and 24 hours for LTI), supervisors must form a team 

to investigate the incident. For medical treatment incidents, supervisors must form an investigative 

team within 72 hours.

The team is responsible for analysing the incident, evaluating the risks, and preparing concluding 

remarks that will be presented to all staff to raise awareness and put in place prevention measures. 

This process should be completed within seven days for fatal incidents, within 10 days for LTI, and 

within 14 days for medical treatment incidents.

IEV periodically conducts an internal review and reference against relevant causes of the ISO 

45001:2018 requirements. The outcome of the audit is analysed and presented at our management 

review meeting. Further action is then taken when warranted. This can involve, among others, 

changing policies and processes that do not work/have resulted in accidents and identifying new 

risks and opportunities.

In FY2020, an internal review found no negative outcomes and that IEV met ISO 45001:2018 

standards.

Occupational health services

IEV considers effective and accessible occupational health services to be important in protecting the 

health of our workers especially in relation to hazards that may be encountered in the oil and gas 

industry.

To that end, IEV provides all staff with hospitalisation insurance, which allows for hospital admission 

without our staff having to pay for any upfront costs. Staff members can also claim up to RM1,200 in 

outpatient expenses each year.

During FY2020, as the world battled a worldwide pandemic, IEV put in place additional measures 

to ensure the safety of our staff and clients and to mitigate fears of possible COVID-19 contagion 

risks. IEV’s factory workers undergo daily health checks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests 

are performed on those who show COVID-19-like symptoms. Also, when there is a possibility of 

staff members having been exposed to those suspected of being infected with COVID-19, they are 

required to stay at home until the latter have been cleared of having COVID-19.

IEV operations staff members who work at client sites must take a PCR test and test negative for 

COVID-19 before they are allowed to start work. If such work requires travel across state/international 

borders, they must serve a 14-day quarantine period before and after their work. 

IEV pays for all PCR tests conducted, and ensures these tests are conducted by accredited medical 

professionals in Malaysia. Workers who have to undergo quarantine or who must work from home 

during their stay-home notice periods will continue to be paid their salaries.

The personal health-related information of IEV’s staff members are kept confidential and the 

maintenance of such information by our HR department follows the regulations set by the Personal 

Data Protection Act of Malaysia. However, should health issues be identified as factors for 

underperformance, the HR department will work with the staff members’ immediate supervisors to 

determine a suitable course of action to improve work performance.

Due to the physical nature of field work in the oil and gas industry, our clients require that assigned 

workers meet minimum health standards so that they can carry out their work without harm to 

themselves or others. Whether these standards are met are determined by mandatory health checks. 

The results of such checks are then forwarded to the client’s, which will then issue the worker with a 

Medical Passport, a prerequisite for starting on-site work.

IEV reassigns any worker who fails a medical check to other work within IEV. When the worker 

regains their health and is able to pass the medical screening, the worker will be assigned back to his 

previous role.

Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and safety

IEV has in place a formal joint management-worker health and safety committee. This committee 

comprises of representatives from IEV’s senior management and the workers. This committee meets 

every quarter and reports to the committee’s chairman, who represents IEV’s senior management.

The committee is responsible for assisting in the development of health and safety rules and safe 

work systems; reviewing the effectiveness of health and safety programmes; carrying out studies 

on accident trends, near-misses, dangerous occurrences, occupational poisoning/disease; reporting 

on unsafe/unhealthy practices and providing recommendations for corrective action; reviewing 

workplace health and safety policies; and making recommendations for revising any existing policy.


Medi Lifestyle Limited

    20

Worker training on occupational health and safety

IEV views training as an essential part of our operations to ensure competency and avoid the risk of 

injury. In that regard, a job safety training is conducted before every engineering service work. IEV 

also arranges for staff to periodically get certified for a range of safety and technical skills via training 

courses, with recertification occurring every two to three years. 

IEV identifies the training courses that staff need to complete by assessing the training needs of 

the various work activities that they undertake. A training matrix is then drawn up to identify the 

necessary skills needed to perform each job and any training gaps on the part of the employee. 

Staff then attend courses that have been matched to their needs/abilities, and what they would be 

required to learn to perform effectively at their job. Staff also attend courses to refresh or update 

their knowledge of occupational health and safety related to their job needs. 

Such training courses have included the following: Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency 

Training; Travel Safely by Boat; Hydrogen Sulfide Training; Working at Height; Permit to Work 

Procedures; and Working in Confined Spaces.

The training courses are conducted by certified third parties or accredited training centres, which 

have been approved by our clients. Also, the courses require participants to pass tests so that they 

can be properly certified to carry out their work. 

It is mandatory for IEV staff to attend training courses that have been assigned to them. IEV bears the 

cost of the courses and ensures that staff members attend the courses during working hours. If the 

courses are conducted outside of the company’s workplace, IEV will pay for the staff member’s travel 

and accommodation.

Work-related injuries

Between January and December 2020, we recorded 101,106 man-hours across our operations 

with zero Loss Time Incidents and zero Medical Treatment Injuries. Hence, the target for FY2020 

to maintain zero Loss Time Incidents and zero Medical Treatment Injuries have been met. In 2019, 

the Group recorded 109,087 man-hours with zero Loss-Time Incidents and zero Medical Treatment 

Injuries.

• Customer health and safety

Assessment of the health and safety impacts of product and service categories

This material factor is new to the Group for FY2020 and is applicable for the healthcare and wellness 

business. Medi Lifestyle understands that customers expect products and services to perform their 

intended functions satisfactorily, and not pose a risk to their health and safety. As such, we ensure 

that we have taken steps to check on the quality and safety of the products we use during the 

duration of our customers’ stay at our centres. We also remind customers that they have the right to 

seek redress should they find our products or services not to their satisfaction.

As a healthcare and wellness services provider, Medi Lifestyle protects its customers’ health and 

safety by providing quality treatments using products that have met safety and health requirements 

as well as through ensuring secure management systems and facilities.

As part of our clinic’s administrative policy to ensure patient health and safety, we hire certified nurses 

who check on mothers and babies daily, recording their vital data in a logbook. The data includes 

temperature, blood pressure, changes in Caesarean stitches, glucose level (in diabetic patients), 

weight, and body growth (for babies).

Our facilities have been retrofitted for optimal safety, such as preventing fire risks and reducing 

accidental falls. We also insure all our commercial outlets, with potential risks assessed on an annual 

basis to see if the current insurance coverage is sufficient.

Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services

In FY2020, we had zero incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning 

the health and safety impacts of our products and services. We aim to maintain this for FY2021.

• Customer privacy

Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data

This material factor is new to the Group for FY2020 and is applicable for the healthcare and wellness 

business. Medi Lifestyle understands that customer privacy and confidentiality have become key 

concerns especially as we move towards an increasingly digital and connected world. Data privacy of 

our customers is of paramount importance to us, and we aim to keep their information secure across 

our operations and supply chain.

Our policy is to be open and transparent about how we collect, use, and disclose our customers’ 

personal data as we continue to invest in building the capacity of our internal operations to protect 

their data and privacy.

In Singapore and Malaysia, where we operate, we conduct our business in compliance with the 

respective countries’ Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which covers various rules governing the 

collection, use, disclosure, and care of personal data. In line with PDPA, we have appointed a Data 

Protection Officer, who ensures that adequate action is taken to protect our customers’ personal data 

and who advises us on what policies to put in place to address data protection issues.

Some of the ways in which we ensure confidentiality and maintain our customer privacy include:

• Information, such as completed forms, are kept in safe, secure, and designated place that can be 

accessed only by staff members of that centre

• Customer information is not disclosed over the phone and is provided only when the customer is 

physically present at the centre

• Promotional and marketing messages via phone calls, text messages will not be sent to customers 

who have registered their phone numbers with the National Do Not Call Registry, except for those 

who have given clear and unambiguous consent to receive marketing messages

• Staff are bound by a confidentiality clause that penalises them for any leaks, thefts, or losses of 

customer data

Medi Lifestyle received zero substantiated complaints of breaches of customer privacy during 

FY2020. We aim to continue to have zero incidents and complaints in FY2021 by strengthening 

our internal controls and keeping updated with regulatory and technological changes so that our 

procedures remain secure.

• Diversity and equal opportunity

Diversity of governance bodies and employees

The Group considers our employees our most valuable asset, and as such, endeavours to offer our 

people a fair and safe work environment. We do not discriminate against race, age, gender, religion, 

ethnicity, nationality, or physical abilities. This is codified in our employee handbook, which is 

disseminated to all our people when they start working with us. 

In addition, we have put in place a strict policy against sexual harassment in order to ensure a safe and 

conducive work environment. We define sexual harassment as conduct of a sexual nature which can 

take verbal (e.g. innuendoes, comments), non-verbal (e.g. leering, obscene gesticulations), visual (e.g. 

posters, signs), physical (e.g. touching, coerced sexual act), and textual/electronic (e.g. e-mails, texts) 

forms. A thorough investigation is launched when a complaint is received and those found guilty will 

be meted punishments, ranging from a warning to dismissal.

In 2020, we received zero complaints for discrimination and we aim to replicate this in future.

We aim to sustain a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment that respects and shows care for 

all our people, which in turn, we believe will improve our business performance. 

In FY2020, IEV employed a total of 43 permanent and full-time employees (including senior 

management and Chief Executive Office, or CEO). The employee gender breakdown was 37% female 

and 63% male. The breakdown for employees in terms of age was 7% were below 30 years old; 81% 

were 30-50 years old; and 12% were over 50 years old. 

Out of the 43 permanent and full-time employees, IEV’s senior management team comprised of 14 

employees holding positions ranging from Assistant Manager to CEO. The gender breakdown of the 

senior management positions was 43% female and 57% male. Out of a total of 14 senior management 

members, 69% of senior management were 30-50 years in age while 31% were over 50 years old. 

All of IEV’s employees are based in Malaysia.

The Group’s Board of Directors, as at the date of this Report, comprised 33% female and 67% male. 

Three Directors were between 30-50 years old and the remaining three were over 50 years old.

In FY2020, Medi Lifestyle employed a total of 26 permanent and full-time employees (including 

senior management and CEO). The employee gender breakdown was 81% female and 19% male. The 

breakdown for employees in terms of age was 19% below 30 years old; 50% were 30-50 years old; 

and 31% were over 50 years old.

Out of the 26 permanent and full-time employees, Medi Lifestyle’s senior management team 

comprised of 6 holding positions ranging from Assistant Manager to CEO. The gender breakdown of 

the senior management positions was 3 females and 3 males. Out of a total of 6 senior management 

members, 67% were between 30-50 years in age while 33% were over 50 years old.

Four of Medi Lifestyle’s employees are based in Singapore, and the rest are based in Malaysia.

We have endeavoured to have an equal gender mix, where possible. However, in the engineering sector 

and the kinds of industries (such as oil and gas) that IEV targets, we do receive more applications from 

males than females. This can account for the slightly lower overall percentage of female employees. 

For the healthcare sector, the reverse is true, with more females applying for positions at our centres, 

thereby tipping the scales towards a female-majority workplace.
