Vibrant Group Limited


Board Statement 

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present the inaugural sustainability report of Vibrant 

Group Limited (“the Group”). 

As part of the Group’s long-term strategy formulation, the Board oversees the direction of sustainability at 

the Group. The Board works closely with the Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”), formed by Vibrant 

Group Limited’s senior management, to obtain updates about the sustainability objectives, strategy and 

performance of the Group. The Board oversaw the identification of environmental, social and governance 

factors (“ESG factors”) material to the Group’s business and its stakeholders as part of our involvement in 

the process of sustainability reporting. The Board also manages and monitors these factors through close 

interaction with management.  

This sustainability report is aligned with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) Sustainability Reporting Guide 

and prepared with reference to the internationally recognised sustainability reporting framework – Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, 2016. 

As an integrated service provider in logistics, real estate and financial services, the Group strives to be a 

leader in sustainable development while managing a commercially successful business. By setting targets 

in material areas and managing our performance, we aim to translate our sustainability efforts into benefits 

for the environment, our employees, our business and the local communities at large.

This inaugural report presents Vibrant Group Limited’s sustainability performance for the period 1 May 2017 to 30 April 2018 

(“FY18”). The scope of the report covers the Group’s most material business in our head office location of Singapore, our freight 

and logistics business. Activities included are international freight forwarding, warehousing property and logistics as well as 

chemical storage and logistics operations. 

Feedback with regard to our sustainability reporting and performance is greatly welcome in order to continually improve our 

sustainability practices. Please send your comments, views, and feedback to corporate@vibrant.com.sg.

Sustainability Approach

As a business that strives toward growth and development, we remain vigilant for emerging trends and developments that may 

present business opportunities. The changing business environment may offer opportunities for us to improve our sustainability 

performance, or sustainability opportunities may provide opportunities to improve our business performance. Our sustainability 

approach recognises the need to enhance our sustainability performance in order to increase our competitiveness. We are 

aware of increasing importance of ESG factors among our stakeholders and the business landscape and we will aim to align our 

sustainability initiatives with our business strategy.

 

Sustainability Governance

Achieving a high level of corporate governance is important to Vibrant Group. Hence, we have set in place a sustainability 

framework that will be reviewed by the SSC, every year.

Sustainability at Vibrant Group is spearheaded by the SSC, whose role is to develop sustainability objectives and strategy, manage 

and monitor overall sustainability performance, and report to the Board. Members of the SSC include the Chief Executive Officer, 

Chief Corporate Development Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

The SSC is supported by the Sustainability Task Force (“STF”), which is responsible for driving the sustainability programme across the 

organisation. The STF comprises members of the senior management teams from different businesses across the Group.

Materiality

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Economic performance is a material factor for Vibrant Group as our business’ economic viability is important to our shareholders. 

We aim to attain sustainable economic growth to provide desirable returns to our shareholders annually. 

Our financial performance for FY18 can be found in the Group Financial Highlights (pages 14 to 15) and Financial Statements 

sections (pages 52 to 59) of the Annual Report. 

A materiality assessment in the form of a workshop was conducted in FY18, where we identified ESG factors that were material 

to our business operations. Senior management team members from different businesses across the Group were involved in the 

materiality workshop. During the materiality assessment, we took into consideration the following factors:

• global and local emerging sustainability trends;

• material topics identified by industry peers; 

• industry best practices; and

• sustainability reporting frameworks.

The material ESG factors identified during the workshop were as follows:

EMISSIONS, EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

Emmisions

Performance for FY18

• Diesel consumption: 1,529,977 litres

• Electricity consumption: 4,643 megawatt hours (MWh)

• Diesel intensity: 0.709 litre/km

• Electricity intensity: 0.0296 MWh/m2 

• Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from diesel consumption: 4,114 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)

• GHG emissions from electricity use: 1,946 tCO2e

• GHG emissions intensity from diesel consumption: 0.002 tCO2e/km

• GHG emissions intensity from electricity use: 0.0124 tCO2e/m2

Target for FY19

• Maintain or reduce our electricity and diesel intensities below FY18’s levels

GHG emissions from fuel and electricity use pose a serious threat to the environment, given the role of GHG emissions in global 

warming. Therefore, reducing GHG emissions remains a global priority. Singapore has declared the year 2018 as the Year of 

Climate Action. A carbon taxation is also planned to be introduced in Singapore from 2019 onwards in order to reduce the 

country’s GHG emissions. 

As a global integrated logistics provider, Vibrant Group recognises the impacts of our business on the environment, particularly 

in regard to the burning of fossil fuels to power our vehicles and offices. We strive to minimise our environmental footprint 

through various practices and initiatives that aim at reducing GHG emissions, while increasing our customers’ efficiency and 

lowering costs. Initiatives in relation to emissions reduction include exploring reduction in electricity consumption at offices and 

warehouses and exploring reduction in fuel consumption in vehicle fleet. We have also set in place policies to aid in emissions 

reduction throughout the organisation as illustrated in the table below.

• Explore energy efficient technologies to implement in operations

• Use of technology to track and control direct energy usage for example, use of diesel in vehicle fleet

• Achieve transparency by enhancing data quality and effects of operations on the environment

• Promote effective environmental management among suppliers and external contractors

• Conduct regular checks on our vehicles to ensure that they comply with environmental regulations as well as 

monitor our diesel consumption

POLICIES IN RELATION TO EMISSIONS REDUCTION

Vibrant Group Limited | Sustainability Report 2018




Environmental Responsibility

The annual diesel consumption of LTH freight trucks increased 3.2% from 1,482,849 litres in FY17 to 1,529,977 litres in FY18 as a 

result of an increase in the total distance travelled by freight trucks to various locations. The Group’s GHG emissions from diesel 

consumption reflected a 3.2% increase, from 3,9873 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in FY17 to 4,1144 tCO2e in FY18. The 

GHG emissions intensity from diesel consumption remained constant at 0.002 tCO2e/km in FY18. The diesel intensity, however, 

decreased from 0.766 litre/km in FY17 to 0.709 litre/km in FY18.

To improve our energy efficiency and reduce our GHG emissions in an effective manner, we monitor our energy and emissions 

intensities regularly. Given the nature of our business, electricity consumption applies to warehouses of the freight and logistics 

business of Vibrant Group. In FY18, our electricity consumption was 4,643 MWh, reflecting a 20.3% increase as compared to 3,858 

MWh in FY17. The increase is attributed to the increase in electricity consumption at 51 Penjuru Road. The Group’s GHG emissions 

from electricity use reflected a 20.3% increase, from 1,6171 tCO2e in FY17 to 1,9462 tCO2e in FY18. The GHG emissions intensity from 

electricity use decreased from 0.0136 tCO2e/m2 in FY17 to 0.0124 tCO2e/m2 in FY18. Similarly, the electricity intensity decreased 

from 0.0325 MWh/m2 in FY17 to 0.0296 MWh/m2 in FY18.

Environmental Responsibility

Effluents and Waste Management

Poorly managed waste and pollution have a significant impact on the environment. Air, soil, water as well as human and wildlife 

health can be affected if hazardous chemicals and non-hazardous waste generated by businesses in various industries are not 

managed correctly. As a provider of integrated logistics solutions, we consider waste management a key issue mainly because 

of the activities of our subsidiary, LTH Logistics. LTH Logistics provides dedicated chemical logistics and distribution services 

handling both hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals as well as their derivatives in Singapore and Malaysia. LTH Logistics also 

engages a licensed third party to collect any waste generated for treatment and disposal. 

We advocate environmental responsibility by setting in place safeguards during the transportation of hazardous substances. 

Hazardous chemicals – such as those that are corrosive, toxic, flammable or oxidising – are stored and transported carefully 

according to specific regulatory requirements.  Policies have also been set in place to support these initiatives and are set out in 

the table below. 

• Comply with environmental protection and management acts and regulations in relation to storage, use and 

dealing of hazardous substances 

• Conducting trainings on handling of hazardous substances

• Implement policies, drills and trainings should accidental spills take place and the appropriate mitigation measures

POLICIES IN RELATION TO EFFLUENTS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

We aim to support these initiatives by systematically recording environmental incidents such as spills as well as maintaining 

appropriate approvals for handling of hazardous chemicals. There were zero spills recorded in FY18 and we aim to continue 

achieving this target in the following year.

5   Minor injuries are defined as all reportable injuries that did not result in death or major injuries.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

At Vibrant Group, we regard health and safety as a priority and see this as an essential part of our business. Safe work practices, 

such as the safe use of vehicles and equipment and the safe handling of hazardous chemicals, are the foundation of a safe 

workplace. We strive to prioritise the health and safety of our employees, customers, third-party service providers and visitors. 

Maintaining a safe working environment at all of our facilities is essential to us. We have, therefore, set in place health and safety 

practices. 

We highlight the importance of a safe working environment to our employees by providing safety tips regularly. We also employ 

an all-round approach to health and safety, taking into consideration training, communication, safety at work sites, security 

operations and audits. The following table presents the initiatives and practices that we have implemented with regard to the 

health and safety of our employees and other stakeholders.

to learn and grow.  

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

We are committed to promoting a diverse workforce and providing a work environment free from discrimination. Our hiring 

process is based on merit, grades or relevant skills. We also constantly review the demographics of our team. Our HR practices 

include conducting exit interviews for voluntary cessation of service. Further, in order to maintain the quality of our services, 

benchmarking exercises are conducted for all our operations, so that a minimum employment standard is achieved. 

The Group has implemented the following policies in relation to employment, which aim at achieving diversity and equal 

opportunity, amongst others:

• Remuneration Policy

• Staff Welfare and Benefit Policy

• Employment Code of Conduct

• Employment Act

• Fair Consideration Framework

• Employment of Foreign Manpower Act

Training and Development

Training and development programmes have been developed for our employees as part of our sustainability strategy. They 

provide opportunities for our employees to learn and grow while increasing job satisfaction and motivation. Our employees are 

encouraged to participate in a wide range of relevant learning and development programmes. During the year, our employees 

received an average of 3.7 hours of training per employee, and we intend to provide our employees with more opportunities for 

training in the forthcoming year. Other programmes that are targeted at employee development include skills and transition 

assistance programmes such as Bachelor in Business Studies (Marketing) and Diploma in Integrated Logistics Management.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

At Vibrant Group, we treat our customers’ privacy with high importance. Proper handling of customer data is not just a regulatory 

requirement but a priority to us to ensure we maintain our customers’ trust. Thus, protecting sensitive and confidential 

information of customers is critical. 

Vibrant Group has several policies and standards acting as preventive measures for the loss or mishandling of customer data such 

as the information technology (“IT”) security management approach to protect business and personal data against unauthorised 

access. We also plan to implement several initiatives in the future, such as:

• introducing the Personal Data Protection Policy that governs the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data;  

• complying with privacy and information security law and regulatory requirements; and

• abiding by the employee code of conduct for the use of personal data. 

Additionally, we intend to appoint a Personal Data Protection officer, who will be responsible for conducting regular checks of 

our IT system in order to prevent the loss of personal data. Reported breaches and complaints of the loss of personal data will be 

documented. We also plan to disseminate information on data privacy requirements to key stakeholders. 

During the year, there were zero substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy. We aim to maintain this 

record for the forthcoming year.

Regulatory Compliance

Vibrant Group strives to have robust corporate governance practices that gain stakeholders’ trust and maintain the necessary 

license to operate. We have implemented measures to ensure that our employees comply with the company’s policies and 

procedures.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We recognise the importance of maintaining high standards of business integrity and complying with applicable laws and 

regulations, including relevant environmental laws and regulations.

Thus, we have stringent monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in place to manage our environmental performance. We 

provide training to our employees to equip them with knowledge on compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

At Vibrant Group, we have zero tolerance towards any form of bribery and any form of corruption. Employees are required to 

adhere to the Code of Conduct and Corporate Policy on Exchange of Gifts, which are amongst the anti-corruption policies in the 

organisation. Information on the Code of Conduct, which includes requirements in record keeping and documentation (e.g. time 

cards and access entry cards), is provided to employees. 

Additionally, a whistle-blowing policy has been put in place for employees to report their concerns about suspected fraud, 

corruption, dishonest practices or other similar matters. Employees are advised to highlight any suspicious practices or 

inappropriate activities and bring them immediately to the attention of the Head of Human Resources (“HR”) and/or any member 

of the Executive Committee. Appropriate action will be taken if an employee is found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or criminal 

conduct in relation to his/her employment. It is also the Group’s policy to protect the identity of the whistle-blower.

In FY18, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including anti-corruption and 

environmental laws and regulations. We aim to maintain this trend for the forthcoming year.
