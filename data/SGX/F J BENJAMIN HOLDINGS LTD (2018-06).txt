BOARD STATEMENT

2

F J Benjamin Holdings Ltd (“F J Benjamin” 

or “the Group” is  proud  to present our 

Inaugural Sustainability Report this year, which 

documents	our	sustainability	performance	for	

the	financial	year	ended	30	June	2018.	With	

our	stakeholders	in	mind,	it	is	firmly	believed	

that operating our business sustainably 

has	 a	 positive	 long-term	 and	 far-reaching	

impact on the Group’s business operations 

and	 	 the	 value	 we	 generate.	 In	 pursuit	 of	

this, the Board remains vigilant in managing 

our Environmental, Social and  Governance 

(“ESG”)  commitments together with senior 

management, in driving the Group’s overall 

growth and development in a sustainable 

manner.	 The	 ESG	 matters	 that	 we	 have	

determined, namely, corporate governance, 

talent management and development, and 

energy use and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 

emissions	are	of	great	importance	to	us	in	

realising	the	Group’s	strategic	objectives	in	today’s	increasingly	dynamic	business	environment.	 

We	 are	 grateful	 to	 all	 Stakeholders	 who	 have	 supported	 the	 Group	 over	 the	 years.	 This	

sustainability	journey	we	are	on	takes	unremitting	effort	and	we	look	forward	to	your	continued	

support	in	building	a	sustainable	future	for	generations	to	come.		




F	J	 Benjamin	 is	 an	 industry	 leader	 in	 brand	 building	 and	 management,	 and	 development	 of	

retail	and	distribution	networks	for	international	luxury	and	lifestyle	brands	across	South	East	

Asia.	With	a	rich	heritage	dating	back	to	1959	and	listed	on	the	Mainboard	of	Singapore	Stock	

Exchange	Trading	Limited	(“SGX-ST”)	since	November	1996,	F	J	Benjamin	currently	has	offices	

in	Singapore,	Malaysia	and	Indonesia,	manages	over	20	iconic	brands	and	operates	220	stores.	

The	Group	comprises	two	core	businesses.	They	are	Luxury	and	Lifestyle	Fashion	Retailing	and	

Distribution	 and	Timepiece	 Distribution	 with	 an	 extensive	 portfolio	 of	 products	 ranging	 from	

adult	apparels,	footwear,	bags,	and	accessories,	to	fragrances	and	cosmetics,	timepieces,	nursery-

related	products	and	beddings.

In moving along with times, whilst our brick and mortar stores give us unique advantages, the 

Group	recognises	the	growing	significance	of	embracing	technology	to	engage	our	customers	

across	all	touchpoints.	To	that	end,	the	Group	is	working	towards	an	omnichannel	approach,	as	

supported	by	our	Omnichannel	Advisory	Board	established	in	March	2018,	to	develop	a	truly	

immersive	and	seamless	experience	that	integrates	both	our	physical	stores	and	online	channel	

for	our	customers.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The	Group	has	formalised	the	engagement	approach	with	our	stakeholders	in	the	identification	

and	prioritisation	of	our	material	sustainability	matters	as	illustrated	in	figures	1	and	2.	Our	four-

step	approach	is	outlined	below.

Figure	1:	Materiality	Assessment	Results

The highly-ranked sustainability matters 

which took into account both internal and 

external perspectives were prioritised 

through an anonymous voting exercise 

among representatives from various 

departments.

A list of potential material sustainability 

matters were identified through a desktop 

analysis of Sustainability Reports published 

by industry players and discussions with key 

personnel across various departments.

The validated material 

sustainability matters will be 

reviewed in subsequent reporting 

period to ensure that reported 

matters remain relevant.

The material sustainability 

matters identified in step 2 were 

subsequently validated by the Board 

for reporting in our sustainability 

report.

All in all, this creates greater value to 

our customers and profitability.

Stores and Contented 

Customers















F	J	Benjamin’s	value	chain	spans	across	4	core	processes	with	a	multitude	of	steps	and	decisions	

made	along	the	way,	from	partnering	with	our	brand	principal	up	to	the	moment	a	customer	picks	

up	a	product	off	the	shelves	of	the	stores.	


OUR GOVERNANCE

The Board strives to enhance shareholder value by upholding high standards of 

corporate governance, integrity and accountability at all levels, underpinned by 

robust internal controls in monitoring compliance matters, code of ethics and risk 

management system. 

Responsibility for Sustainability Governance

Our everyday decisions have implications on the business and its long-term sustainability, which 

is	why	the	Board	is	assuming	responsibility	in	overseeing	and	managing	the	ESG	matters,	further	

supported	by	the	Chief	Operating	Officer	(“COO”),	the	respective	Head	of	Departments	(“HODs”)	

and	Sustainability	Reporting	Team	personnel	from	various	departments.

Ethics and Intergrity

Approach

F	J	Benjamin’s	Corporate	Code	of	Ethics	serves	to	reinforce	its	values	(Figure	3)	and	instill	in	its	

culture,		the	duties	and	obligations	(“Code	of	Conduct”)	of	its	employees	within	the	organisation.	

This has brought the company success over years, to its valued shareholders, principals, business 

partners	and	its	customers.	

Overseen and monitored by F J Benjamin’s Regional Compliance and Internal Audit department, 

it	is	also	regarded	as	the	personal	responsibility	of	every	employee	and	director	to	understand	

and	 comply	 with	 the	 Code	 of	 Conduct	 that	 is	 made	 available	 to	 all	 new	 employees	 during	

employee	induction.	F	J	Benjamin	maintains	its	zero	tolerance	towards	any	violation	of	the	Code	

of	Conduct.	Any	wrongdoings	may	result	in	disciplinary	actions,	which	include	reporting	of	matter	

to	the	authorities	in	cases	of	suspected	corruption	or	any	forms	of	criminal	act.	

All	 stakeholders	 can	 also	 raise	 any	 matters	 pertaining	 to	 possible	 improprieties	 in	 financial	

reporting	or	other	matters	with	guidance	from	our	whistle-blowing	policy	which	details	examples	

of	reportable	incidents	 and	 reporting	procedures,	as	 well	 as,	the	investigation	and	feedback	

process	thereafter.

Upholding a Corruption-free Environment

Anti-corruption practices are communicated to all employees during their induction program 

upon	 joining	 the	 company.	 It	 is	 required	 for	 employees	 to	 acknowledge	 and	 abide	 to	 the	

Supplementary	Staff	Policy	detailing	anti-corruption	practices	further	to	the	terms	and	conditions	

stipulated	in	their	employment	contract.

Performance

In	FY2018,	100%	of	our	employees	have	acknowledged	by	signing	off	on	their	Supplementary	

Staff	Policy.	To	that	end,	we	have	also	achieved	zero	substantiated	cases	of	corruption	during	the	

year.

We	constantly	aspire	to	build	and	enrich	each	brand	under	our	care	but	always	in	cognizance	

of	the	highest	quality	standards	that	are	consistent	with	the	brand’s	legacy	and	image.		We	

aspire	to	long-term	relationships	with	principals	which	are	a	testimonial	of	our	integrity	and	

commitment	to	our	business	partners.	

We	 endeavour	 to	 enhance	 shareholder	

value	over	the	medium	to	long	term.

We	aspire	to	be	the	most	distinctive	and	

responsive organisation with the highest 

quality	standards	in	all	our	undertakings.	

We	 lead	 by	 example	 whilst	 maintaining	

a	strong	sense	of	our	identity,	objectivity	

of	thought	and	accountability	of	results	in	

pursuit	of	excellence.

We	 continually	 strive	 for	 an	 environment	

of	 resilience	 through	 professionalism,	

commitment 

and 

sound 

business 

practices.	 We	 are	 proactive,	 resourceful	

and 

entrepreneurial 

and

to 

continuously

We	 endeavour	 to	 provide	 customer	

service	 excellence,	 extending	 beyond	

geography and product, enhancing the 

entire	shopping	experience.

100%	of	new	staff	to	acknowledge	the	Supplementary	

Staff	Policy	on	anti-corruption	practices

TARGET

FY2018 PERFORMANCE

Zero validated non-compliance cases with all applicable 

laws and regulations 

Approach

The Group recognises that by engaging in socially-responsible business practices and 

maintaining compliance with the applicable laws and regulations where it operates in, it builds 

positive	reputation	which	gives	F	J	Benjamin	an	edge	over	its	peers	in	terms	of	its	offerings	

and	 recruitment	 of	 high-calibre	 candidates.	These	 are	 pertinent	 factors	 which	 drive	 business	

performance	and	enable	us	to	achieve	our	objectives	and	greater	growth	as	a	Group.

For	any	new	regulatory	requirements,	relevant	staff	are	provided	opportunities	to	attend	training	

and	workshops	to	gain	a	better	grasp	of	the	compliance	requirements.	In	addition,	F	J	Benjamin	

works	closely	with	accredited	external	auditors	and	its	legal	advisors	to	ensure	that	all	regulatory	

requirements	with	SGX-ST	listing	rules	and	the	various	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	

are	adhered	to.

Performance

As	a	testament	to	the	effectiveness	of	the	management	and	measures	in	place,	we	have	achieved	

zero	validated	non-compliance	cases	with	all	applicable	laws	and	regulations	during	the	year.	We	

will	strive	to	maintain	this	good	track	record	in	the	following	years.

Talent Management and Development

Approach

F J Benjamin’s growth is sustained by the people who work tirelessly to keep operations running 

smoothly,	to	bring	latest	products	to	the	store	and	the	delivery	of	valued	service	to	our	customers.	

Thus, we seek to ensure that our employees receive the necessary resources they need to reach 

their	fullest	potential	professionally.		

As	a	retailer	and	distributor	of	products,	a	significant	amount	of	training	is	tailored	to	brand	

stipulated requirements and are conducted by the store operations and merchandising team 

to	 ensure	 that	 service	 standards	 and	 product	 knowledge	 of	 the	 front-end	 employees	 meet	

the	expectations	of	the	Brand	Principals.	As	required,	we	also	have	an	in-house	ACTA	certified	

trainer	who	is	qualified	to	deliver	training	in	developing	the	skill	set	of	our	employees.	On-the-

job	training	is	further	implemented	at	stores	whereby	newly	joined	front-end	employees	will	be	

buddied	with	a	senior	staff	or	supervisors	at	the	store	and	are	tested	on	their	product-knowledge	

using	a	checklist	at	the	end	of	the	training	period.

13


To	 identify	 relevant	 learning	 needs	 and	 interests	 of	 our	 employees,	 an	 annual	 performance	

appraisal	 exercise	 is	 conducted	 at	 F	 J	 Benjamin.	 The	 appraisal	 results	 are	 subsequently	

communicated	to	all	employees	and	acknowledged	by	them.	

Performance

For	FY2018,	we	have	completed	the	performance	appraisal	for	100%	of	our	employees	and	

achieved	an	average	of	35	hours	of	training	hours	per	front	line	employee.	

Target

TARGET

FY2018 PERFORMANCE

To	achieve	an	average	of	35	training	hours	per	front	line	

employee annually

INTRODUCING MANDARIN COURSES

To	better	serve	the	needs	of	our	Chinese-speaking	customers,	FJ	Benjamin	has	specifically

selected employees whose mother tongue is not Chinese to participate in a Conversational 

Mandarin	Course	targeted	at	learners	working	for	the	Retail	Industry,	including	in-store	coaching.

In	further	ensuring	the	course	meets	the	specific	needs	of	the	Company	and	Brand	Principals,	

the	HR	manager	worked	closely	with	the	certified	learning	centre	to	ensure	that	the	programme	

covered	a	list	of	customer	service	terminology	frequently	used	by	each	Brand.

As	at	end	June	2018,	21	employees	across	Singapore	and	Malaysia	have	successfully	completed	

the	conversational	mandarin	course.	These	employees	are	expected	to	share	their	knowledge	and	

impart	words	learnt	to	fellow	colleagues	at	the	stores.	Given	the	success	of	this	programme	which	

has	been	well-received	by	our	frontline	employees,	we	are	encouraged	to	extend	this	to	more	

employees	in	the	following	years.	

Course Feedback

“With	the	basics	that	I	have	learnt	from	the	class,	I	am	now	able	to	handle	enquiries	from	chinese	

speaking	customers	and	build	better	rapport	with	them.	It	has	increased	my	confidence	level	when	

communicating	with	these	customers.”

-Sumiyati, La Senza

“Personally, learning mandarin has enchanced my knowledge and understanding towards the 

chinese	customs.	I	can	now	communicate	with	my	Chinese	colleagues,	customers	from	Mainland	

China,	Taiwan	and	Hong	Kong	on	the	ongoing	store	promotions	and	assist	them	in	finding	products	

and	sizes	they	need	in	an	effective	and	efficient	manner.”

-Komar, Superdry

OUR ENVIRONMENT

“Every single individual matters, every single individual makes some impact on 

the planet every single day, and we have a choice as to what kind of difference 

we’re going to make.”

-Jane Goodall

Energy Emission and GHG Emissions

Approach

In	 recent	 years,	 the	 issue	 of	 climate	 change	 and	 its	 impacts	 have	 become	 increasingly	 more	

prominent,	giving	rise	to	the	urgent	need	for	corporates	and	individuals	worldwide	to	address	

them.	At	F	J	Benjamin,	our	primary	environmental	footprint	stems	from	electricity	used	for	lighting	

and	air-conditioning	to	run	our	retail	stores,	warehouses	and	offices.

In our commitment to conserve electricity usage, we have installed Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) 

lightings	 which	 are	 more	 energy	 efficient	 and	 long-lasting	 in	 comparison	 to	 conventional	

incandescent	light	bulbs	at	new	stores	and	retrofitted	stores	of	larger	floor	area.	

We	further	strive	to	inculcate	a	culture	of	good	environmental	housekeeping	practices	at	F	J	

Benjamin	offices	in	Singapore	and	Malaysia.	Some	of	our	initiatives	include,	switching	off	the	

office	lights	daily	during	lunch-hour	period	and	when	not	in	use	after	office	hours.	Recently,	our	

headquarters	in	Singapore	shifted	to	an	office	of	a	smaller	floor	area,	which	has	additionally	

allowed	us	to	achieve	effective	utilisation	of	space	and	savings	on	energy	consumption.	Video	

conferencing	capabilities	are	also	built	in	to	facilitate	regional	meetings	and	reduce	the	frequency	

of	air	travel,	thereby	reducing	our	carbon	footprint.

Performance

We	are	currently	in	the	process	of	building	a	structured	data	collection	process	to	track	and	

monitor	the	performance	of	our	electrical	consumption	based	on	the	various	retail	store	and	

office	locations	on	a	monthly	basis.

At	the	end	of	FY2018,	25	stores	have	installed	LED	lights.

TARGET

FY2018 PERFORMANCE

To	 implement	 a	 structured	 data	 collection	 process	 for	

environmental	data	by	FY2019
