Chairman’s Letter to Stakeholders 

 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

I am pleased to present the Sustainability Report of Ezion Holdings Limited (“Ezion” or “the Company”) 

and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) covering our Group’s performance from 1 January 2018 to 31 

December 2018 (“FY2018” or “the reporting period”). 

In this report, we disclose the Group’s sustainability efforts and performance in all aspects of our 

business strategy and operations. We actively engage our stakeholders and identify the sustainability 

issues material to them so as to progress in a sustainable manner.  

We are fully aware that our global operations in the Liftboat as well as offshore oil &amp; gas sector has a 

tremendous impact on the environment. As such, we have made it our priority to innovate through 

process enhancement and energy-saving technology. We strictly comply with environmental 

regulations and standards in our operations to conserve biodiversity and minimize impact on the 

environment.  

The Group imposes a stringent and high standard of occupational health and safety guidelines to govern 

our operations. We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to any breach of regulatory and safety 

requirements to ensure a safe and conducive working environment.  

The Group also ventured into providing support services for the construction and maintenance of 

offshore wind farms. We have a set of safety framework and policies in place to ensure the health and 

safety of our employees. 

Ezion will engage with local communities on an ongoing basis to understand their needs including 

education and healthcare, and implement appropriate programmes to improve their overall well-being 

and create positive social impacts. 

Ultimately, we are steadfast in our belief that the Group’s success depends not only on financial success 

but also on growing sustainably and creating a better future. 

 

Dr Wang Kai Yuen  

Chairman 

Ezion Holdings Limited

Organisation Profile  

 

Ezion is listed on the Main Board of the SGX-ST. The Group’s Liftboats and Jack-up Rigs are focused 

on production enhancement, extraction-related activities of the offshore oil &amp; gas industry and 

supporting the offshore wind farm industry.  

Liftboats and Jack-up Rigs 

We are engaged in the owning, chartering and management of rigs involved in the production and 

maintenance phase of the oil and gas industry as well as the offshore windfarm industry. 

Our Liftboats are designed to serve the offshore oil &amp; gas and wind farm industries by providing well 

services support work, platform work support, accommodation support and offshore platform 

decommissioning support.  

The Group has one of the youngest, largest and most modern Liftboat fleet in the world and is also one 

of the pioneers to promote self-propelled Liftboats in Asia and the Middle East. The Group is also the 

only operator in Southeast Asia that has a Liftboat fleet that can be used for offshore oil &amp; gas and wind 

farm operations.  

Offshore Wind Farms 

Ezion has ventured into the offshore wind farm business segment through strategic partnerships and 

securing global projects to support offshore wind farm construction. In December 2015, the Group 

entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with a Chinese state-owned enterprise to support 

offshore wind power installation projects in China. In 2016, the Group secured a contract in the United 

Kingdom and in 2018, another contract in Germany to support offshore wind farm construction.

Ethics and Integrity  

 

Ezion works diligently to ensure our employees adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity 

and comply with applicable regulations and professional codes of conduct.  

 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy  

GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3 

 

The Group has implemented an anti-bribery and corruption policy where we adopt a zero-tolerance 

approach towards unethical behaviour. Ezion is committed to always comply with all anti-bribery and 

corruption laws where we do business. All new staff are briefed on the established Code of Conduct 

during their orientation. 

To ensure that our staff conduct themselves in a professional manner when dealing with clients and 

vendors, Ezion requires staff to declare receipt of gifts from third parties. To avoid putting staff in a 

compromising position, in particular those holding senior positions and those having to deal with 

vendors, staff are to declare any conflict of interest, both potential or real, on a regular basis or as and 

when they deem timely. The Group does not condone bribery and corruption by third parties and/or 

government entities.  

The Group has provided accessible channels for employees, shareholders, clients, consultants and 

suppliers to raise concerns on possible improprieties in financial reporting, fraudulent acts and other 

irregularities. These communication channels ensure independent investigations and timely 

implementation of appropriate preventive and corrective actions.  

In FY2018, there was no confirmed incident of corruption or any whistleblowing report.  

 

Governance and Statement of the Board  

 

Ezion’s Board and Senior Management assess sustainability issues as part of the strategic formulation 

of the Group. The Board is supported by the management’s Sustainability Task Force (“STF”) 

comprising heads of different business units which help to spearhead sustainability efforts in the 

organization. The STF is chaired by the Acting Chief Financial Officer who will oversee achievement of 

all sustainability targets and report to the Board.  

The Board incorporates sustainability issues into the strategic formulation of the Group. The Board with 

the assistance of the STF determines the material environmental, social and economic factors, and 

ensures that the factors identified are well-managed and monitored. 

Ezion adopts a precautionary approach in strategic decision making and daily operations by 

implementing a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework which is aligned with 

the requirements of ISO 31000:2009 Risk Management framework. To enhance the effectiveness of 

the ERM framework, the Group implemented Orion ERM system, a third party software that automates 

the risk management, internal control and assurance functions and enables these functions to be 

managed on an integrated platform. On a yearly basis, a Group-wide assessment is conducted to 

update the firm’s risk profile in the ERM framework and reflects changing business risk exposures and 

addresses the significant and relevant risks to the Group. 

Please refer to the Corporate Governance Report in our 2018 Annual Report for more information on 

our corporate governance practices and risk management structure.

Protecting the Environment 

 

Ezion operates in strict compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as taking the 

necessary steps to protect the environment. The Group is committed to increase efforts in reducing any 

negative environmental impact. Our management assesses all identified environmental risks of the 

vessels and our operations and establishes appropriate safeguards. 

 

Teras Offshore Pte Ltd (“TERAS”) stands firm in our commitment to the protection of the environment 

and the community at large. This commitment policy will transcend from top senior management level 

down to the entire hierarchy of the Company’s reach. This policy provides a framework for setting and 

reviewing environmental objectives and targets. 

 

By committing to sustainable operations, we look forward to protecting the environment and saving 

costs at the same time. 

 

Energy and Emissions Management  

GRI 302-5, 305-5 

 

The Group is committed to managing our energy consumption and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 

in a sustainable manner. Ezion has implemented various initiatives targeted at reducing energy 

consumption both in the office as well as on the vessels and rigs utilised by the Group.  

 

Our vessels implement the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (“SEEMP”) which is in compliance 

with International Maritime Organisation Marine Pollution (“IMO MARPOL”) Annex VI for the reduction 

of GHG emissions.  

 

We strive to achieve energy efficient operations through thorough planning, implementation, monitoring 

and review of energy efficiency measures within a continuous improvement management cycle. Our 

measures include the following: 

 

- 

Monitor fuel consumption and reduce fuel wastage; 

- 

Reduce heat/energy loss; 

- 

Minimise hull resistance; 

- 

Maintain optimum speed during open sea passages; 

- 

Train vessel staff in energy efficiency; and 

- 

Optimise trim adjustment and reduce ballast. 

 

To further reduce our carbon footprint on board, non-operational vessels are subjected to strict 

measures such as efficient utilisation of equipment and reduced manning to conserve fuel consumption. 

Effective utilities management and utility energy conservation training programmes are provided to all 

personnel on board (“POB”) of operational vessels to reduce fuel and utilities energy consumption. 

Resources such as crew, resources and transportation are maximised to eliminate wastage, and 

signages and posters are posted on board to promote awareness. 

 

Managing Biodiversity  

GRI 304-1, 304-2, 304-3 

 

Ezion carries out many business activities in the sea, including managing and operating liftboats and 

rigs. Given the nature and locality of our operations, the marine ecosystem is integral to our business. 

The Group is aware of the importance of preserving the ecosystem to ensure sustainable economic 

growth.  

 

Undoubtedly, our business activities in the sea carry certain environmental risks, such as sea pollution 

and oil spills. As such, we have an environmental management plan in place to protect the surrounding 

ecosystem of our operations. The Group also implemented an Environmental and Social Assessment 

to measure the environmental impact of our operations and drive at the importance of saving the 

environment. 

 

By having zero tolerance environmental pollution, Ezion hopes to protect and preserve biodiversity 

where operational activities are carried out. 

 


13 

 

Effluents and Waste Management 

GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-5 

Ezion has adequate effluents and waste management principles that are in line with the “International 

Management Code for the Safe Operations of Ships and for Pollution Prevention” (“ISM Code”), ISO 

9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007.  

Ezion has a marine environmental management plan which underlines the procedures and process in 

the management of spillage. There are robust risk management and preventive measures for activities 

with high spillage risk. The Group has zero tolerance for spillage of harmful chemicals. There were zero 

oil and chemical spills in FY2018. 

Managing our Suppliers  

GRI 308-1, 308-2 

Ezion requires its vendors and suppliers to strictly comply with the environmental standards and policies 

governed by TERAS. We also assess our major suppliers on their environmental impacts and 

responsibility on an annual basis. The assessment requires suppliers to disclose their financial stability, 

licensing and specific certifications such as ISO9001, ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001 which relate to 

responsibility of environment accreditation. 

Annual appraisals on the performance of all key suppliers in terms of environmental regulation 

compliance will be carried out to ascertain that the environment is not compromised by the activities of 

Ezion’s suppliers. 

Environmental Targets and Compliance  

GRI 307-1 

Ezion has also put in place an internal audit system to ensure conformance and effective 

implementation of its Integrated Management System (“IMS”). External audits are conducted by ABS 

Group to certify our management system on-board our assets to ensure compliance with ISM and ISO 

14001 Standards. 

The IMS is reviewed annually to promote continuous improvement. We ensure that the system is in 

strict compliance with mandatory rules, applicable codes, guidelines and standards recommended by 

the IMO, Administrations, Classifications Societies and maritime industry organisations regulations 

applicable to both ships and shore-based operations. 

There was no incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in FY2018. In order 

to maintain strict environmental compliance and achieve our environmental targets in FY2019, we have 

reviewed our environmental performance in FY2018 and developed an action plan for FY2019.

Our People, Our Assets 

 

Ezion is committed to the development, safety and wellbeing of our staff. We value and fairly 

remunerate our staff, and treat everyone equally and with respect.  

Through TERAS, we stand committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees and by 

extension, the community. We strive for zero fatal accidents in all operations and have implemented 

measures to ensure workplace safety. 

Workplace Health and Safety 

GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 416-1, 416-2 

To protect the health and safety of our employees, we have implemented stringent policies and 

operational procedures to govern all offshore activities. Strict compliance with these policies are 

enforced by the Group to protect our employees. We conduct regular maintenance of our fleet and 

equipment to ensure safety of the users, primarily our crew and staff.  

Liftboats and Jack-up Rigs Operations 

As our operations are in diverse parts of the world where illnesses and diseases are not uncommon, 

we have implemented various medical policies to minimise the health risk of our employees working in 

such areas. Ezion has established various medical response plans such as Influenza, Ebola, Lassa 

Fever, Tuberculosis and Malaria plans as part of our emergency response plan. This allows us to 

respond to the threat of serious diseases in a timely manner by putting in place appropriate measures 

to mitigate risk.  

The Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Assurance (“HSEQA”) Department regularly disseminates 

medical and travel advice to all office and seafarers. Doctors and medics are stationed on board our 

Liftboats to provide medical responses and conduct weekly regular hygiene inspections to mitigate 

health risks of our employees.  

In addition, Ezion is committed to preventing safety hazards at all cost, be it on-board at sea or in port. 

To achieve zero safety incidents, we conduct regular vessel safety checks and maintenance to ensure 

that all vessels operate at the industry’s highest safety standard. We also have strict implementation of 

safety measures and practices to mitigate safety risks. 

Offshore Wind Farm Operations 

The site safety of our wind farm installation and construction is managed by a Health, Safety and 

Environmental (“HSE”) Committee comprising qualified personnel. The Committee works hard to 

provide a safe working environment and promotes safe working practices in all daily operations.  

Our management assesses all identified risks to the employees and establishes appropriate safeguards. 

We monitor all incidents and accidents for timely address and institute mitigating and preventive controls 

to protect the safety of our employees.

Training and Career Development  

GRI 404-1, 404-2, 404-3 

Ezion believes that having a well-trained workforce is what keeps the Company at the forefront of its 

business activities. Training is an important aspect of the Company’s commitment to the development 

of our employees. We conduct annual performance appraisals to cultivate a developmental training 

program for our employees that optimises their career and professional development. 

In addition to optimising employee development, performance appraisals are conducted to promote 

staff engagement, retention and performance. Employees are apppraised on their performance and 

progress with their respective managers and meaningful career targets are set.

We conducted our first Senior Leadership Preparatory Programme (“SLPP”) where senior officers 

undergo company-specific leadership programmes before they assume command on board our 

Liftboats as Master and Chief Engineers. The SLPP includes assessment on our Lifeboat Simulator, a 

full mission ship handling simulator built in accordance with our Liftboat specifications, where senior 

officers are assessed on their manoeuvring skills, bridge resource management and emergency 

response. 

Holistically, Ezion conducts Townhall meetings to promote staff communication and the company’s 

strategic direction. Despite the industry downturn that the company is experiencing, we abstain from 

retrenchment exercises.  

Gender Equality  

GRI 405-2 

Ezion believes in remunerating all employees fairly based on their ability and performance. Basic 

remuneration for women is equal and comparable to men of similar position and performance. We 

uphold the principle of employee fairness and equitable remuneration without placing gender into the 

equation. 

Ethical Labour Management  

GRI 408-1, 409-1, 412-1, 414-1 

Ezion prides itself as a good global corporate citizen. We require all vessels to be in strict compliance 

with the Maritime Labour Convention (“MLC”), which is an international labour organisation that 

embodies all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour conventions and 

recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour 

conventions.  

Under this convention, we stay committed to protect the individual rights and standards of living of our 

crew on-board. All grievances and disputes among the crew members on-board are fully documented 

and properly addressed. We also conduct regular site visits by shore personal (e.g. HSE, operations, 

technical and management) to gather feedback on areas of improvement from the crew members. 

We do not condone the engagement of child labour or forced labour in our work. We ensure that our 

operations comply with human rights policies and procedures, and we strictly abide to acceptable 

societal norms on how we carry out our work.  

In addition, we uphold the same principles in the appointment of labour suppliers. In this respect, we 

usually engage suppliers of reputable standing, whom we believe share the same values and practices 

in labour management.  

Workforce Targets and Compliance  

GRI 419-1 

The Group endeavours to be a socially responsible employer. Ezion’s commitment to strict compliance 

with all applicable codes, regulations and guidelines is reflected and documented in its HSE policy and 

its comprehensive IMS. The IMS is fully implemented across the company and the fleet is audited 

internally and externally (e.g. Classifications Society, Flag State, and Port State Control (“PSC”)) for 

compliance.  

During FY2018, all vessels operated by Ezion had fully complied with the applicable codes, rules, and 

guidelines, standard as required by the IMO, Administrations, Classification societies and Maritime 

industries. There were no instances of non-compliance, PSC detention or any fines imposed on any 

vessel operated by the Group. 

In order to maintain strict compliance with labour laws and regulations and achieve our workforce 

targets in FY2019, we have reviewed the effectiveness of our workforce strategies in FY2018 and 

developed an action plan for FY2019.

Contribution to Local Community 

 

Ezion’s operations span the entire globe and have an impact on local economies. We hope to have a 

positive impact on local economies through procurement and hiring practices. Efforts to innovate and 

enhance our operations potentially stimulate innovation and create greater working opportunities in 

local communities.  

 

Indirect Economic Impacts  

GRI 202-1, 203-2, 204-1 

Ezion’s global operations result in a business footprint that spans across multiple countries. The 

company is committed to making economic contributions to the countries in which it operates in through 

paying its fair share of corporate taxes to the governing bodies of the countries. We adhere strictly to 

the business framework set up in each country to ensure we are in compliance with the business ethics 

of operations.  

Enhancing employment opportunities in the local community 

We employ crew and employees from more than 20 countries around the world and we strictly comply 

with national minimum wage laws. We believe that by providing local communities with more job 

opportunities, we have a chance to stimulate their economic and social development. 

Developing offshore wind energy infrastructure creates jobs in component manufacturing, turbine 

installation, facility operation and maintenance, and other various areas which indirectly support these 

activities. Manufacturing requires skilled labourers who design and build towers, rotor blades, 

generators, hubs, substation interconnects, and assorted electronic controls which make up a wind 

turbine power generating platform. Installation typically involves local construction firms which help to 

boost local economies.  

As such, the operation and maintenance needs of wind farms create permanent and high-quality local 

jobs. With an increase in employment and income level, consumer demand and spending in the 

community increases, resulting in overall economic and social development.  

Procurement Practices Opportunities 

The economic impact of building an offshore wind farm extends well beyond the direct jobs created by 

building and installing the equipment. Each dollar invested creates impacts that ripple outwards 

throughout the local economy and creates indirect jobs for suppliers of intermediates, components and 

services. In addition, all new workers require housing, food and other necessities that will be purchased 

locally.  

The Group’s Manufacturers, Developers and Contractors require support in cranes, transportation, 

labour, accommodation and subsistence which are sourced locally. During our operations, there will be 

additional demands for inputs from industries that sell non-labour goods and services directly to the 

project (i.e. raw materials, equipment and tools, industrial or manufacturing required services, etc.).  

Skills upgrading 

The Group works with local companies during the execution of its projects. The staff at local companies 

will develop skills and capabilities that will change the productivity of the industry and benefit the 

economy in the long term.  

Training and developing workforce readiness of the locals is a very important part in developing a work 

ready community. Using the skills and knowledge of external developers and contractors as a model, 

community colleges, universities and unions can be enlisted to offer specialised training to the local 

community, thereby increasing the workforce quality of the community.

Community Engagement  

GRI 413-1 

The Group endeavours to achieve a sustainable development of the local communities where we 

operate in. As such, we will engage with local communities on an ongoing basis to understand their 

needs including education and healthcare, and implement appropriate community engagement 

programmes to improve their overall well-being.
