Board Statement 

 

 

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present Asiatic Group (Holdings) Limited’s (the 

“Company” and its subsidiaries, collectively known as “the Group” or “Asiatic”) fourth sustainability report. 

The Board considers Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters as a priority, hence the Board 

has been placing a huge emphasis on maintaining responsible business practices. 

This year, the Board conducted a review on our material ESG matters, first identified in the financial year 

ended 31 March 2018 (“FY2018”) and found that they continue to remain relevant to Asiatic’s business 

activities. We have since adopted a phased disclosure of our sustainability performance which facilitates 

a strategic review of our material ESG impact and contributions each year - enabling us to track and 

strengthen our progress. This report adheres to Rules 711A and 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of the Catalist and references the 

internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. 

The Board provides direction and works closely with management to oversee and guide all sustainability 

related matters. In the financial year ended 31 March 2021 (“FY2021”), Asiatic has managed to achieve our 

targets set for all our material ESG factors. We have recorded zero incidents of non-compliance and will 

always be committed to upholding the high standards of corporate governance. We have ensured that the 

number of work-related injuries or fatalities remained zero. Our carbon emissions intensity from our 

Cambodia operations have increased marginally despite our thorough annual maintenance regime to help 

maintain the energy efficiency at our power plants. In the next financial year, Asiatic will continue to 

target and maintain the high standards that we have set for ourselves. 

As the world undergoes massive transformations to tackle unprecedented challenges arising from the 

COVID-19 pandemic, enhancing risk processes, strengthening capabilities and collective global action will 

enable the world to build resilience against future disruptions. Asiatic has taken and continues to take 

action to address the challenges posed by the pandemic to minimise business disruptions and support 

recovery efforts. We have implemented safe distancing measures and sought alternative solutions to 

ensure that the health and safety of all our employees and stakeholders remain as key priority. 

The following report summarises the Group’s sustainability performance for FY2021 and our dedication 

to tracking of progress in delivering long-term value for our stakeholders.

Asiatic’s COVID-19 Response 

Asiatic’s highest priority is to ensure the safety of our employees and customers. Asiatic has endeavoured 

to work closely with all our stakeholders to provide the necessary support needed to minimise disruptions 

to our operations. As part of our Business Continuity Plan, a Covid-19 Pandemic Policy was assembled to 

further guide our business through this pandemic.

About the Report 

 

Reporting Scope 

Sustainability reporting is performed on an annual basis, with our last report published on 31 August 2020. 

This report is Asiatic’s fourth sustainability report which covers the non-financial performance of the Group 

for the period from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 containing relevant historical performance data included 

for comparison, where available. The report is prepared with reference to Rules 711A and 711B of the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of the Catalist, 

which draws on the guidance set out by the SGX-ST Practice Note 7F Sustainability Reporting Guide. 

Based on our geographical information under Asiatic’s 2021 Annual Report on Page 87, our non-current 

assets in Cambodia and Singapore are 83.8% and 16.2% respectively. Considering our energy operations 

have a relatively larger contribution in Cambodia compared to the emissions from our Singapore operations, 

we have focused the energy section on our power plants in Cambodia. As such, our focus for the scope of 

this sustainability report will be on the energy operations in Cambodia and the group-level disclosures for 

regulatory and health and safety matters. Asiatic has adopted a phased approach towards the inclusion of 

our operations for reporting, and as we mature in our sustainability journey, further consideration will be 

given to the expansion of our reporting scope to include other operations.

Reporting Standards  

GRI Reporting Principles have been incorporated as Asiatic’s sustainability reporting framework as it is an 

internationally recognised framework, selected by Asiatic to provide a universal context to report on 

material ESG matters and define Asiatic’s sustainability content and quality. 

Table 4: Reporting Standards, External Assurance and Feedback 

GRI Standards 

This report has been prepared with reference to the 2018 Global Reporting Initiatives 

(“GRI”) Standards: “Core” Option

Our People 

At Asiatic, we believe our people are the key drivers of our success and are essential to long-term growth 

and prosperity of the Group. It is therefore imperative for us to foster an inclusive and diverse working 

environment that encourages collaboration. For Asiatic to grow and prosper, we seek to build an inclusive 

and diverse working environment conducive for productivity and collaboration. A key objective at Asiatic is 

to foster learning and development among our employees, which we believe is vital to the long-term growth 

of the Group. 

Figure 4. Asiatic’s Employee Profile 

 

In FY2021, our total workforce for both operations in Singapore and Cambodia totalled to 192 as compared 

to 193 at the end of FY2020. Our manpower resources remain relatively stable for the previous and current 

financial years despite the challenges faced during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

As of FY2021, there were a total of 85% male employees and 15% female employees in the Group. Similarly, 

the trend could be observed in FY2020. This is due to the nature of our business and as observed typically 

across industries in our sector, males usually constitute a larger proportion of our workforce.  

The Group is committed to ensure equal opportunities are offered to our employees based on merit, 

regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, and religion. Our hiring processes strictly follow a no child labour 

and/or forced labour practice.

Materiality Assessment 

In 2018, a materiality assessment workshop was conducted by an external consultant to identify and 

prioritise Asiatic’s material ESG matters. The Board reviews these matters annually to ensure the relevance 

of the material ESG factors to the Group. The material sustainability matters were identified based on ESG 

matters with the most significant impact on the Group’s operations and key stakeholders.  

Figure 6. Materiality assessment approach 

 

Based on our materiality assessment process in FY2018, three material ESG matters were identified. As 

there were no major changes to our operations, the material matters reviewed by the Board were 

determined to be relevant for FY2021’s sustainability report.

Regulatory Compliance 

 

 

 

 

Our Approach 

Policies 

 

The Group’s corporate governance practices are informed by Asiatic’s corporate 

governance framework.  

 

The Quality Policy in our fire protection solutions business embodies our commitment 

to comply with relevant laws and regulations.  

 

Commitments 

and Target 

The Group has a perpetual target of zero confirmed cases of non-compliance with 

regulatory requirements and aims to conform with all relevant socio-economic and 

environmental regulations. 

 

 

Our robust corporate governance framework ensures that the necessary processes are in place for a high 

standard of corporate governance. The Board and various Board committees oversees the framework and 

involves independent external auditors. A comprehensive set of internal controls and processes required 

by the framework was audited by an external party. Annual audit review procedures include verification of 

compliance with all relevant legislation and regulations.  

Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To have  

zero 

confirmed cases of 

non-compliance 

Why is it important for us? 

In Asiatic, we believe a strong corporate governance constitutes the right 

principles, policies and risk management practices to maintain a sustainable 

business. As a Group, the importance of complying with the laws and 

regulations of the countries our businesses operate in is continuously 

emphasized as it is integral to our reputation and value to our stakeholders. 

Asiatic is committed to upholding the high standards of corporate governance 

and will continue to align its practices with the Code of Corporate Governance 

2018. 

Achieved in FY2021 


Page | 15 

The Group’s fire protection solution business follows the Quality Policy, developed as part of our ISO 

9001:2015 certified Quality Management System (”QMS”). Our QMS ensures we comply with all applicable 

statutory regulations and that our professional services are delivered to a high calibre. 

Our whistle-blowing policy provides a direct channel for all internal and external stakeholders to raise 

concerns about possible matters of improprieties or wrongdoings in confidence. Complaints can be made 

in writing to taykahchye@gmail.com, and all reports will be addressed in accordance to the whistle-blowing 

policy with assured confidence. Feedback is directed towards the Audit Committee who is charged with 

ensuring an independent, thorough, and fair investigation is conducted. Employees are urged to follow all 

ethical and legal requirements to ensure the Group’s integrity and reputation are protected.   

Employees are promptly informed if there are any corporate policy changes, following the annual review by 

the Group’s management. In FY2021, a review by management on all operational risks pertaining to 

customers, suppliers, competitors, government agencies, and employees, was conducted on 13 August 2020 

for Asiatic Fire System Pte Ltd. The review of operational risks identified was overseen by the Director and 

resulted in action plans with segregated duties assigned.  

Our Performance 

As a testament to the strength of our corporate governance, the Group is pleased to share that there were 

no complaints received under our whistle-blowing channels in FY2021. Similarly, no whistle-blowing 

complaints were received for the past two reporting periods, FY2019 and FY2020.  

Fines for the incident of non-compliance in FY2020 with the Companies Act to hold the annual general 

meeting have been paid. In FY2021, there were no non-compliance cases reported with regards to 

environmental laws and regulations as well as for social and economic areas.  

Internal and external audits were conducted for Asiatic’s Singapore and Cambodia’s operations, systems, 

or management responsibilities. For all completed audits, any points raised by the internal and external 

auditor have been considered and implemented where applicable and closed as at the end of FY2021. The 

results from the audit process concluded that all statutory requirements were in compliance.

Workforce Health and Safety 

 

 

 

 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

Our occupational health, safety and security policy aims to avert all work-related 

injuries and illnesses.  

 

The policy facilitates the identification of potential risks in our operations, thus 

enabling us to implement necessary work precautions, training, and practices.  

Commitments 

and Target 

The Group has a perpetual target to achieve zero work-related incidents and 

illnesses at our workplace. 

 

 

Asiatic has an unwavering commitment to provide a conducive working environment by managing risks 

inherent to our operations. In Cambodia, the health and safety procedures at our energy operations in 

Cambodia mirror this belief. In Singapore, our risk management process was developed in accordance to 

the Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Risk Management Regulation1 and WSH Code of Practice2. The risk 

management process frames the roles and duties within the Group and provides reference on the 

identification of hazards, evaluation of risks, determination of the risk levels, and preparation of action plan 

to eliminate, contain or control risks. 

 

 

1 The Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulation is part of Singapore’s Workplace Safety and Health Act. 

2 The Code of Practice was developed and published by Workplace Safety and Health Council in collaboration with the Ministry of Manpower, 

Singapore. 

Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To achieve  

zero 

work-related    

incidents and    

illnesses at our 

workplace 

Why is it important for us? 

As employers, we believe our employees’ health and safety is paramount, and 

it is our priority and responsibility as employers to create a safe working 

environment. To reduce the spread of Covid-19 transmission, Asiatic has 

implemented stringent safety measures to ensure the well-being of our 

employees, sub-contractors and visitors. 

 

Achieved in FY2021 


Page | 17 

To facilitate and supervise the application of risk management practices, a Risk Management Committee 

involving both managerial and senior staff-level employees was established. The committee regularly 

conducts discussions and shares reports to senior management on any findings or workplace health and 

safety developments that require attention as required during the year. The Risk Management Team Leaders 

also must attend an approved course in Risk Management methodology to ensure competency. Figure 8 

below outlines the flow of Asiatic’s risk management process. 

Figure 8. Asiatic’s risk management process 

To ensure that Asiatic is in compliance with all workplace health and safety measures, a yearly external 

audit is conducted, and any identified gaps are promptly addressed and actively monitored for 

improvements. To demonstrate our commitment in providing a safe and conducive working environment for 

our employees, Asiatic has also obtained several health and safety certificates as shown in Table 6 below.

Table 6. Current health and safety certification 

Asiatic Fire Service – Singapore 

Certification 

Description 

ISO 9001:2015 

Quality Management 

System 

This certification specifies requirements for a quality management system 

wherein organisations must demonstrate the ability to consistently provide 

products and services that meet regulatory requirements and aim to enhance 

customer satisfaction through effective application.  

BizSAFE level 4 

Risk Management 

This certification is a necessary step in adhering to requirements under the 

Workplace Safety and Health Act (“WSHA”), which recognises that the 

organisation has the knowledge to implement a robust Workplace Safety and 

Health Management System.  

 

Our employees are encouraged to remain vigilant, proactive and approach health and safety at the 

workplace as a shared responsibility. In-house and external risk management-related trainings and 

certification courses are offered to selected employees at least every two years. The trained employees are 

to share their newly acquired knowledge skills to their colleagues with the objective of alleviating the 

frequency of work-related injuries. The Group targets to conduct fire drills and evacuation exercises on a 

regular annual basis to further prepare for emergency contingencies, and in FY2021, a fire drill was 

conducted on 19 December 2020. Our employees are expected to maintain caution as needed, report any 

incidents, and diligently participate in all emergency preparedness activities. Employees, contractors, and 

all relevant external parties are also expected to adhere to our safety management systems and quality 

standards which applies across all our premises.  

At our site, we track every incident reported. Our employees are required to immediately report relevant 

workplace incidents, including near misses, in accordance with Asiatic’s incident investigation procedures. 

This procedure consists of the following steps: 

1) 

Identification, Classification and Reporting of Incident 

2) Investigation &amp; Analysis of Non-Conformance, Accident and Incident 

3) Corrective and Preventive Action 

We have a yearly training plan organised for our employees in Singapore where all service and technical 

site staff would be sent for safety courses related to the nature of their job scope. All other employees are 

also sent to attend workplace health and safety training courses. For Cambodia, our employees follow a set 

of standard operating procedures to ensure that the safety at the worksite is upheld. 

To promote our employees’ health, all employees have access to general medical care provided through 

company clinics and health insurance. Material Safety Data Sheets (“MSDS”) were provided by our suppliers 

to better aid Asiatic’s employees on handling hazardous chemicals safely. Asiatic will also provide similar 

MSDS to our customers. Asiatic will develop voluntary health promotion services and activities for 

employees to address major non-work-related health risks (e.g. smoking, alcohol abuse, etc) should the 

need arise.

Our Performance 

We have put our Covid-19 Pandemic Policy in place to ensure our employees were well-protected against 

the virus. These safeguarding measures include scanning of safe entry code upon entry and screening of 

temperature regularly. On top of these measures, our employees were to practise personal hygiene such 

as disinfecting their personal workspace before start of work and washing their hands regularly. More 

information about our Covid-19 Pandemic Policy can be found on Page 3. 

Table 7. Occupational Health and Safety Performance Data 

In FY2021, the total hours our employees worked were 204,071 hours and 229,995 hours for Singapore and 

Cambodia respectively. As compared to FY2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a 5% and 17% 

decrease in total working hours for Singapore and Cambodia respectively due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Despite being an essential service during Singapore’s Covid-19 circuit breaker between April to June 2020, 

our services could not be provided to customers who were classified as non-essential services. In 

Cambodia, the number of staff who worked night shifts was reduced due to lower demand from Electricite 

Du Cambodge, a state-owned Cambodian electricity supplier.   

For FY2021, we were proud to achieve zero work-related injuries and fatalities in both Singapore and 

Cambodia. This was mainly attributed to the reduced in number of hours worked and the implementation of 

the new Fall Prevention Plan introduced in FY2021 to promote the health and safety of our employees and 

protection our environment. The Fall Prevention Plan provides a systematic approach to eliminate or reduce 

the occupational risk by ensuring that all reasonable safety measures are adopted before the start of any 

work. We will strive to maintain this track record in the coming years, as well as a safe working space for 

our workers across our operations.

Energy Efficient Operations and Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions  

 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

We aim to ensure compliance with all necessary regulations and laws in the 

countries we operate in, to sustain good environmental practices and alleviate our 

carbon footprint where possible.  

 

Commitments 

and Target3 

The Group is committed to managing our environmental footprint whilst ensuring a 

stable supply of electricity to meet the needs of the communities we serve.  

Our target is to perform a thorough maintenance regime at least once a year to help 

maintain energy efficiency and carbon emissions intensity at our power plants. 

 

At Asiatic, regular checks and maintenance procedures are conducted for our power plant equipment. In 

addition, an annual rigorous maintenance is conducted to ensure that they are in optimal operating 

conditions for on-demand functions. Corrective measures will be taken upon any irregularities identified. 

This process ensures safe operations at our power plants and manage energy consumption levels 

effectively. 

 

 

3 Our power plants in Cambodia are generally required to operate during periods of power outage or low power supply from the grid. As generation 

is on an on-demand basis and not continuous, this thus pose a limiting factor in setting a quantitative target to have substantial reduction in carbon 

intensity  

Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To conduct a 

thorough 

maintenance 

regime at least 

once a year to help 

maintain energy 

efficiency and carbon 

emissions intensity at 

our power plants 

Why is it important for us? 

As climate-related challenges are reaching significant threat levels, 

stakeholders such as the government and investors are seeking 

imperative measures for businesses to mitigate risks. Thus, the Group 

strives to seek and mitigate these risks involved.  

As our energy business in Cambodia involve fossil fuels, it has a 

significant contribution to emissions as compared to Singapore. Thus. the 

Group is focusing on measures to reduce emissions in Cambodia.  Asiatic 

will review and consider expanding our scope for this material matter as 

we mature. 

 

Achieved in FY2021 


Page | 21 

 

Our Performance 

In FY2021, our carbon emissions intensity increased marginally by 0.9% from 0.84 metric tons of carbon 

dioxide per megawatt hour (“tCO2/MWh”) in FY2020 to 0.85 tCO2/MWh. Due to the reduced operations caused 

by the Covid-19 pandemic and the shortening of the PPA, the amount of electricity generated and sold was 

significantly reduced and the efficiency of the plants were affected as they were no longer running at full 

capacity. This results in the marginal increase in carbon emissions intensity as compared to FY2020.  

Over the reporting period, Asiatic’s total fuel and electricity consumed for power generation was 108,308 

gigajoules (“GJ”). In FY2021, Asiatic sold 35,407 GJ of electricity to the grid, resulting in the remaining 72,902 

GJ of energy consumed within the organisation.  

The total electricity generated by our power plants was 10.42 Gigawatt-hour (“GWh”), of which approximately 

9.84 GWh of electricity was sold to our customers.  

In FY2021, our total scope 14  and scope 2 carbon emissions were 8,095 metric tons of carbon dioxide (“tCO2“) 

and 242 tCO2 respectively. 

The Group was pleased to share that our target of conducting a maintenance regime for all engines in our 

power plants was achieved in FY2021. We strive to review and improve our practices each year to manage 

our energy consumption and GHG emissions levels in a sustainable manner.
