Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries Ltd 

Sustainability Report 2018 

Environmental  

 

The Company is continuously working on ways to manage and minimise the 

impact of our business operations on the environment. The Company strives to 

reduce the carbon footprint to the environment. 

 

The Company is certified under ISO 14001:2015 Certification in Environmental 

Management System in relation to fabrication and coating of metal products. 

This certification reflects the Company’s on-going commitment to reduce 

environment impact. 

 

Waste disposal and management 

 

Recognizing all natural resources is scarce on this earth. Nam Lee optimises the 

resource usage and minimises waste.  

 

Examples of recyclable waste include carton boxes or any other paper-based 

materials used for packaging and scrap metals left after the production process.  

 

The production workers are the first contact point to handle such materials. All 

production workers are trained to segregate the recyclable waste from general 

waste. Besides, clearly labelled recycling bins are placed at designated areas 

for proper segregation of recyclable waste. The recyclable waste is collected 

and not disposed together with the general waste to minimise impact to 

environment. 

 

The Company also invested in waste water treatment plants to reduce the 

impact on environment. Certain manufacturing plants are equipped with waste 

water treatment plant to treat the waste water generated during 

manufacturing process. The waste water will be treated before releasing into 

public drain.

Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries Ltd 

Sustainability Report 2018 

Energy consumption  

 

In the effort of minimising carbon footprint, Nam Lee offices are installed with 

energy efficient light bulbs and electrical appliances with high energy efficiency 

ratings. Changing the electrical appliances with higher energy efficiency will 

enable a reduction in electricity consumption.  

 

Besides, Nam Lee offices are using FSC paper for daily operation. FSC papers 

are the forest product that have been sourced in an environmentally-friendly, 

socially responsible and economically viable manner.  

 

Social  

 

The management recognizes employees are the Company’s most important 

asset for the success and growth of the company. As such, the Company 

maintains a diversified workforce in terms of age and nationality with different 

skills and experiences, which are expected to create synergies and make 

positive contribution to the Company. 

 

Occupational health and safety  

 

Zero work-related injuries are Nam Lee’s safety management objective. Nam 

Lee continues to provide effective management trying to ensure the health 

and safety of employees. 

 

The Company has successfully attained the bizSAFE Star award and OHSAS 

18001 Certification in Occupational Health and Safety Management as a 

reflection of the Company’s commitment to safety and confirming that the 

Company has met international occupational health and safety standards.  

 

The Company engages external and in-house safety officers to ensure safety 

regulations are duly complied with. The external safety consultant oversees 

the Company’s safety rules and enhances the existing safety rules continuously. 








 

| 10  

 

Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries Ltd 

Sustainability Report 2018 

Besides, the external safety consultant will conduct spot-check within the 

premises to ensure the safety rules and regulations are complied at all times. 

The in-house safety officer continuously monitors the safety measures and 

seeks ways to create a safer working environment. The in-house safety officer 

makes regular patrol in the premises to ensure all the production workers are 

adequately equipped with the proper protective gear depending on their 

vocations (masks, gloves, safety boots, ear plug, protective eyewear). To 

further minimise the risk of injury, safety posters / instructions are placed at 

strategic locations at the workplace to continuously remind employees to 

adhere to safety rules. 

 

Safety officers will conduct a safety orientation to all new employees who work 

at production site. The safety orientation provides general guidelines including 

but not limited to housekeeping rules of maintaining a clean and safe 

workplace, usage of personal protective equipment, rules of operate 

machineries  and guidelines on handling various type of materials. 

 

For those employees that need to operate on more complex machineries, a 

separate briefing and a copy of the machinery manual will be given to provide 

better guidance to the employee and consequently minimise the safety risk. 

 

During FY2018, there has been no incidence of occupational disease and work-

related fatalities. Our safety record for FY2018 showed Accident Frequency 

Rate (“AFR”) was 3.74 cases and Accident Severity Rate (“ASR”) was 23.48 days. 

AFR measures the frequency of workplace incidents occurred per million man-

hours worked. ASR refers to the number of man-days lost to workplace 

accidents per million-hours works. 

 

Training and education  

 

The management believes that regardless of race, age, gender, religion, marital 

status or nationality, all employees should be treated equally and given equal 

opportunities to grow and develop in accordance to their levels of competency.  

The Company invests continually in our employees to upgrade and develop 

their skills. The employees are given access to necessary training to equip them 








 

| 11  

 

Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries Ltd 

Sustainability Report 2018 

with the right skills to perform their jobs more efficiently and effectively. On 

average, the Company provides seven hours of training to the staffs. 

 

Diversity and equal opportunity  

 

The management strongly believes that treating the employee with respect, 

dignity and giving fair treatment will nurture a motivated workforce. In the 

long run, this will result in sustainable growth in Nam Lee. 

 

The hiring procedures are fair and non-discriminative. Staffs are hired on basis 

of merit – skills, experience and competency to perform the job – irrespective 

of race, age, gender, religion and marital status. 

 

The Company has an all-inclusive work culture, with people working in 

harmony despite differences in ages, gender and ethnicity. Given the work 

nature of the manufacturing and construction sectors, about 70% of our 

employees are males. 

 

As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate against any 

employee on the basis of age. Our people are as young as 25 and as matured 

as over 70, working together and learning from each other.  

 

In Singapore, the retirement age is 62 years old and our retirement age is 67 

years old – five years more than the legislated. Employees can opt for 

retirement at 62 or continue until they are 67. Although it is permissible by law 

to reduce their pay once they reach the legislated retirement age, our older 

employees continue to enjoy the same benefits and compensation as they had 

before if they continue to work in the same job.
