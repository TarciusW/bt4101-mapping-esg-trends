Board Statement

“Our Corporate Vision is to become one of the world’s leading diversified chemical

company in ‘Organic Chemistry’ with a global presence and delivering products

that meet international standards.”

As a leading chemical manufacturer with a global presence, MOL is committed to conducting

our business activities in an economically, socially and environmentally responsible manner

governed

by

high

standards

of

internal

controls

and

risk

management

practices.

Understanding the concerns and interests of our stakeholders is crucial as we continue to look

at growing our business opportunities. Our commitment to sustainability guides our growth

strategies and business practices.

The outbreak and spread of the coronavirus disease has impacted all of our lives in ways we

could not have imagined. During this time, MOL has assisted customers by not insisting on

free or discounted goods or services. While we are able to fulfil our contractual obligations, we

face some delays in production and completion of on-going projects due to shortage of

manpower. However, this is now improving with the easing of lockdown restrictions in the

country.

In 2018, MOL conducted our first materiality assessment and published our inaugural

Sustainability Report. This is our third Sustainability Report (“Report”) and it has been

prepared by taking reference from the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (set out in

Listing Rule 711A and 711B) and the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, a globally-

recognized sustainability reporting framework, for reporting on topics that are deemed material

to MOL.

This report focuses on MOL’s sustainability performance with regards to the Group’s

operations in India from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 (“FY2020”). In this Report, we have

also included the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) to show how

our business supports the UNSDGs. A phased approach is being adopted by MOL for our

sustainability report and we will seek to provide additional disclosures on our material topics as

our sustainability reporting matures over time.

The Board maintained oversight over the Sustainability Committee, managing sustainability

risks and opportunities, while ensuring all Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”)

matters significant to our business are addressed in our Report.

We welcome stakeholders to provide us with feedback and suggestions on this report. You

may contact us at helpdesk@meghmani.com.

Stakeholder Engagement

MOL continues to engage with our various groups of stakeholders on an annual basis to

understand and address their concerns. As our businesses continue to expand, the topics that

are material to our key stakeholders may change to reflect the relevance and significance to

our operations.

In FY2020, we continued our internal engagement with our key stakeholders through the

multiple established channels to re-evaluate the relevance and significance of the material

topics for this reporting period. Understanding the on-going concerns of our key stakeholders

allow us to strive for continuous success in creating value for all our stakeholders. As MOL

continues to grow our business, we are committed to review and report changes in the

material issues in subsequent reports.

Product Safety and Stewardship



Customer Health &amp; Safety

GRI 416-2

Our Approach

MOL’s core focus is our commitment to customer satisfaction. Ensuring our products are safe

for our customers’ intended application is key in maintaining the continued trust of our loyal

customers. Our customers come from a broad background of diverse industries and it is

important to understand their respective applications of our products. MOL recognises the

concerns on the safe application of chemicals and their impact on the health and safety of our

customers. We understand the restrictive regulations and we sought to comply.

MOL adheres to the strictest regulatory requirements and standards local to our businesses.

Understanding our products hazards, its risks and impacts allow us to identify and manage key

areas for MOL to focus on and adhere to local requirements on product information. We

assess our products to ensure that the health and safety of our customers are not

compromised. MOL keeps up to date with technological advancements that will aid the

development of innovative products that surpass the highest regulatory requirements of health,

safety and environment.

Our Performance

In FY2020, we have zero cases of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes

related to the health and safety impacts of our products and services.

Product Safety and Stewardship

Environmental Compliance

GRI 307-1

Our Approach

MOL believes that environmental compliance is the primary foundation that forms our

commitment to environmental law, regulations and standards. We acknowledge that the nature

of our business leaves a large environmental footprint and we strive to reduce the impact our

business activities imposes on our ecosystems. MOL adheres to the local environmental rules

and regulations and our environmental policy guides us in managing our operational activities

in minimizing impact.

The use and application of hazardous materials is present in our operational activities. Proper

safe and responsible disposal facilities are provided with necessary capabilities to treat the

liquid and solid waste. Air emissions that contain pollutants are regulated by the local laws

which we need to comply. Our agrochemicals products are strictly controlled and we require

prior registration with the relevant governing authorities in each country before we are allowed

to sell. Thus, qualitative standards and permitted toxicity levels set by each governing authority

will need to be complied with before we can sell our agrochemicals products.

MOL has a greenbelt at our factory premises with an environmental management system in

place at the plant locations. We provide proper training to ensure our employees are aware of

the environmental regulations and obligations while ensuring proper and adequate safeguards

are maintained at our plants at all times. MOL has four multifunctional productions facilities in

Gujarat and three are ISO 9001 certified. We are committed to improve our health, safety and

environment performance by ensuring chemical product safety and making our processing

plants secure.

Our Performance

We had zero cases of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in FY2020.

Environmental Management

Energy

GRI 302-1

Our Approach

MOL recognizes the impact our businesses can have on the environmental ecosystem. As the

core of our business is chemical manufacturing and uses a significant amount of energy, we

are committed to conserve our energy usage to minimize the impact on the ecosystem. Our

environmental policy guides us in our environmental practices. Since we started collecting

data, we have a better understanding of our performance and can set a realistic target.

Our Performance

In FY2020, we have consumed a total of approximately 1,617 TJ of energy across our

operations which includes both renewable energy and non-renewable energy. MOL currently

has four wind mills for the four plants located at Dahej, Ankleshwar, Panoli and Vatva, as well

as a solar power purchase agreement for the plants in the three locations Dahej, Ankleshwar

and Panoli. In FY2019, our renewable energy generated was approximately 7.3% of the total

energy consumed, while in FY2020, we have achieved an increase to 8.2% by increasing the

proportion of solar energy generated, thus helping to avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

of 32,333 tCO2.

Business Practices and Competition

Anti-Corruption

GRI 205-1

Our Approach

Good business practice is an important foundation for our business activities to progress. MOL

conducts our businesses with the highest standards of ethical business practices in a fair and

transparent manner. We hold a strong stance against corruption and have in place a Whistle

Blower Policy that employees can use for reporting of unethical practices without fear of unjust

retribution.

Our Performance

In FY2020, there have been no reported cases of corruption.



Anti-Competitive Behaviour

GRI 206-1

business activities. We support a free competitive environment ensuring fair business practices

for all our employees and stakeholders.

in FY2020.


Meghmani Organics Limited | Sustainability Report 2020

Occupational Health and Safety

Occupational Health and Safety

GRI 403.-2

Our Approach

MOL believes the safety and wellbeing of our employees is our highest priority. We recognise

that the use of machinery in our manufacturing plants and operational facilities can pose as

safety hazards and health risks. Some of our products and raw materials are considered to be

hazardous and working with hazardous materials can pose a health risk to our employees in

the operating plants. Enforcing a strong safety culture in all our facilities provides assurance for

our employees to perform at their best in their daily operational activities. We adhere to local

health and safety regulations and our environment, health and safety policy guides us in

promoting safety measures in our operational facilities.

Training is provided on a regular basis to our employees in the operational plants to

continuously align themselves to safety regulations and standards, recognise safety hazards

and implement control measures when faced with a safety risk situation. A safety manual is

provided to all employees in our operational plants. Work procedure and safety instructions

are clearly communicated for each activity. All employees working in the operating plants are

required to wear personal protection equipment at all times. We implement safeguards in

handling, storing, transporting, importing and sale of our hazardous products and raw

materials. All our plants are equipped with a medical facility to regularly conduct routine

medical checks on our employees working in these plant facilities. Medical support is available

in case of any occupational health and related issues and a selected few are trained in first aid.

Fire-fighting equipment are also available at all plants and regularly maintained.

Our Performance

In FY2020, MOL had no cases of reportable accidents.

What We Have Done During Coronavirus Pandemic

The Government of India imposed a lockdown on 24 March 2020 which was lifted on 31 May

2020, but following that, guidelines on phases of reopening were issued, and as of 31 Aug

2020, the Union Home Ministry issued the Unlock 4.0 guidelines which allowed the resumption

of metro trains from 7 September in a graded manner, while political, social and religious

congregations of up to 100 people will be permitted from 21 September. Restrictions on inter-

state and intra-state movement of persons and goods will also be lifted. Manufacturing services

were exempted from the lockdown and MOL continued with production during this period, but

with heightened precautions taken to ensure the health and safety of the staff. Some of the

measures taken by MOL include having employees to be on different teams so as to have

rotating or alternate teams in the office and plant. Employees are reminded on the need for

social distancing in the office and plant, and are also issued face masks and hand sanitisers at

their work stations. Regular disinfection of the office and plant areas are also conducted to

ensure commonly frequented surfaces or areas are kept clean.

Employee Development, Diversity and Benefits

Employment

GRI 401-1

Our Approach

MOL believes our employees are essential in maintaining a long-term success. We are

committed to fair employment practices and maintaining a working environment where our

employees are respected and empowered to perform at their best. Boosting our employee’s

morale in turn reduces our employee turnover rates while strengthening our employee’s

productivity performances. MOL strives to understand the concerns of our employees to keep

them engaged at all times.

Our Performance

In FY2020, we hired a total of 365 new employees, bringing our total headcount to 1,611

employees. We have an overall hiring rate of 33% and an overall turnover rate of 18.4%.

What We Have Done During Coronavirus Pandemic

No employees from MOL were laid off or furloughed during the coronavirus lockdown period in

India from 24 March 2020 to 31 July 2020.

Employee Development, Diversity and Benefits

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

GRI 405-1

Our Approach

MOL believes in providing equal opportunities in an open environment. We hire and retain our

employees solely based on merit and capacity to contribute. MOL does not tolerate any form

of discrimination based on colour, race, religion, political inclination and any other type of

distinguishing characteristics. MOL attracts and retains a diverse set of qualified and

experienced employees. Equally important for a diverse talent pool is to have a diverse

management board as a diverse set of skills, seniority, and industry knowledge will bring in an

exchange of different ideas and perspectives.

Our Performance

Approximately 99% of our workforce comprises of males, and 1% females. The majority of our

employees are aged between 30-50 years old and are employed as non-executive employees.

Our Community

MOL strives to enrich the quality of life not only for our employees but also for our

communities in which we operate.

To foster cohesion among our employees, we organised MOL’s Annual Day Celebration on 28

November 2019 for our employees of all our plants and subsidiary companies. This event was

attended by approximately 1,200 employees.

As part of our social engagement approach, a Meghmani Talk Series” (મેઘમણી વ્યાખ્યાનમાળા)

was organised for the larger audience of the society during the year under review. The

objective for this series of talks was to raise the awareness on various important social,

cultural, spiritual and historical subjects/topics. Well-known and reputable subject matter

experts were invited to speak to an audience of approximately 250 attendees comprising of

public and our employees.

MOL was also a sponsor of the Ahmedabad Cyclothon 2020 which was held on the 15th and

16th February 2020. The Ahmedabad Cyclothon is an annual event that aims to promote sport

and fitness among the people and involves cycling 50km on roads of Ahmedabad.

Our Community

Migrant workers who were trying to return to their home states when the government

announced lockdown measures on 24 March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic,

were stranded as a result of transportation cancellations. MOL supported the needy and

stranded workforce in Dahej and Panoli areas and also distributed ration kits to approximately

1,000 migrant workers. As the pandemic continues to impact the country’s economy across

industries, the health and safety of our employees and workers remained our top priority. In

addition to regular sanitising of offices and work premises, social distancing and compulsory

use of face mask are also practised in our workplaces.

MOL also develops relationships with and provides in-kind funding to local organisations which

are well-placed to deliver additional social benefits to the wider community in each

neighbourhood where we have a presence, taking into account of real local needs. In FY2020,

MOL contributed more than 10,000 wellness kits, which include essentials such as face masks,

soap, homeopathic medicine and vitamin C tablets in the towns of Viramgam and Bharuch,

both of which are located in the state of Gujurat.

Going forward, our priorities are to continue to cultivate deeper relationships with the local

communities and increase awareness of MOL’s community involvement. We see these efforts

as vital for increasing social capital in the areas where MOL has long-term interests, and

ensuring cohesion between our employees and the local community.
