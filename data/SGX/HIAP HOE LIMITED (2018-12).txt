Chairman &amp; CEO Message 102-14 

We are once again pleased to present our 

Sustainability Report (the “Report”) of Hiap 

Hoe Limited (“Hiap Hoe” or the “Group”), as 

prepared in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, the 

“Core” option.   

At Hiap Hoe, we recognise that sustainability 

forms an integral part of our operations and 

strategies, and we strive to continue driving 

our operations in the direction in which we can 

contribute positively to all of our stakeholders.  

This Report aims to inform stakeholders of 

Hiap 

Hoe 

about 

our 

sustainability 

performance in a transparent and accountable 

manner for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 

December 2018 (“FY2018”). It covers the 

Group’s strategies, initiatives and performance 

in relation to the economic, environmental, 

social and governance factors as per the GRI 

Standards. 

We have identified 14 indicators that matter 

most to our business, and to both internal and 

external stakeholders. These material issues 

are taken into account through our four 

sustainability strategies – Business Integrity, 

Environmental Sustainability, Human Capital 

and Health &amp; Safety.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With the dynamic economic, environment, 

social, 

and 

governance 

landscape, 

we 

recognise the need to adapt our operations to 

accommodate these changes.  

Hiap 

Hoe 

will 

continue 

to 

consider 

sustainability issues as part of our strategic 

formulation and operations across the Group.  

We appreciate having all our stakeholders on 

this journey together with us, to build a more 

sustainable future.

Our Approach to Sustainability 

 

Materiality Review Process 102-46 102-47 

The materiality principle is applied to define the 

content of the Sustainability Report. As part of 

Hiap Hoe’s process to determine materiality, 

internal strategic reviews and sustainability 

workshops, some of which were moderated by 

external consultants, were conducted during 

the year. During these sessions, the Group 

reviewed its vision, mission and core values, 

strategic direction, sustainability impacts and 

material topics.  

 

 

We have reflected on significant economic, 

environmental and social impacts to determine 

aspects that are material to the organisation. As 

a result, indicators of the GRI’s Sustainability 

Reporting Standards 2016 were assessed and 

we identified the following 14 indicators that 

are relevant to the respective businesses of 

Hiap Hoe.  

The materiality assessment was subsequently 

endorsed 

by 

Hiap 

Hoe’s 

Sustainability 

Committee.

We are pleased to share that we met our FY2018 target in which there were no confirmed incidents 

of corruption involving our employees or business partners for both Hotel Operations and

mainly in the form of Liquified Petroleum Gas 

consumed by kitchens in hotel restaurants for 

cooking.

Environmental Sustainability 

Reduction of Energy Requirements  102-12 302-4  302-5 

Hiap Hoe’s stance towards energy consumption is that of continuous improvement which involves 

looking for ways to minimise the consumption of the Earth’s limited resources. As a step towards 

achieving the aforementioned goal, Hiap Hoe has taken on the following key initiatives: 

• 

Continuous monitoring of the weather condition and adjusting the air-conditioning 

temperature accordingly; 

• 

Ensuring the air-conditioning system is adequately maintained and serviced periodically to 

optimise efficiency and reduce energy consumption; 

• 

On-going projects to replace existing florescent lights to LED lights to conserve energy;  

• 

Ensure that air-conditioning in the corridors are turned down to “fan-mode” during low-

occupancy periods to conserve electricity; and 

• 

Installation of one of the largest solar photovoltaic panels in the southern hemisphere (Marina 

Towers), in the form of a black architecturally-integrated monocrystalline array spanning across 

the tower’s roof. 

In addition, Hiap Hoe once again showed their exemplary track record with regards to 

environmentally friendly practices through the achievement of the BCA (Green Mark Gold) 

Certification for Ramada Hotel.  BCA Green Mark is a green building rating system used to evaluate 

a building for its environmental impact and performance.  

We will continue with our aim on reducing electricity consumption in FY2019.

Water Consumption  303-1 

Tracking and monitoring of water consumption 

are performed through the monitoring of 

monthly water bills from the Public Utilities 

Board.  

There was an increase in water consumption in 

Ramada and Days Hotel in FY2018 (91,420 m3) 

as compared to FY2017 (75,425 m3). This was 

due to increase in F&amp;B covers in 2018 and 

guest’s preference. 

To conserve water, we provided the option to 

hotel guests to do their part in saving the 

environment by opting to not have the Room 

Attendants wash their sheets daily. 

We will continue with our aim on reducing 

water consumption in FY2019.

Health and Safety 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety 

Hiap Hoe’s fundamental focus is that of creating a safe environment for all employees by 

implementing best practices into our daily business activities that support our sustainable strategy.  

There is currently a process in place to report all health or safety incidents to the Fire Safety and 

Risk Management committee through monthly meetings which will cover the following key topics: 

• 

Training on workplace safety; 

• 

Routine checks on shoes for anti-slip soles; 

• 

Regular checks on equipment to ensure that they are maintained and serviced adequately; 

• 

Review of incident reports for the month and discussion of improvement points; and 

• 

Risk assessment and reviews to mitigate and minimise incidents and risks. 

All employees are required to adhere to all stipulated policies and procedures to prevent health 

and safety incidents from occurring. Additionally, managers from all business units are encouraged 

to assume the responsibility of supervising their staff to further enhance safety within the 

organisation. 

 

Accident Frequency Rate &amp; Accident Severity Rate 403-2 

We recorded zero fatalities in FY2018.  The number of accidents reported in FY2017 was 4 cases 

and in FY2018 was 10 cases. The type of injury include slip and fall, cuts, strains and sprains and a 

total of 12 man-days were being lost. We acknowledge the importance of employee safety and 

will continuously improve workplace safety and strive to achieve a zero-accident occurrence rate. 

When a work injury is being reported to the Security department, the medical leave granted is 

then submitted to the Human Resource department and filed with the Ministry of Manpower, if
