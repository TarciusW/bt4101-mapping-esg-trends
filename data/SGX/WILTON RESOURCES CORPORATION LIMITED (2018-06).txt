Board Statement | About Wilton Resources Corporation Limited | About this Report | Engaging our Stakeholders | Focusing on What Matters Most |

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Wilton Resources Corporation Limited (“Wilton” 

or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), we are pleased to present our 

inaugural Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2018 (“FY2018”). We recognise 

that the long-term success of our business is intimately linked to the well-being of the communities we 

operate in. As such, we seek to carry out our operations in a socially responsible manner and create 

sustainable value for our stakeholders. This report communicates and reinforces this commitment to 

all our stakeholders.

Under the guidance from the Board, the management has identified key Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) matters that are of the highest importance to our stakeholders. The Board takes 

them into account in its strategic formulation and continues to oversee the management and monitoring 

of these material ESG matters. Going forward, we hope to gain the support from our stakeholders and 

their involvement as we progress in our sustainability journey.

The Board recognises that good governance is 

essential for continued growth and investors’ 

confidence, and that all businesses have to 

manage their own operations responsibly.

Vision

• To be an accomplished gold mining company in Asia

Mission

• We are committed to providing sustainable value to our stakeholders and be socially responsible

Core Values

• Pledge of Partnership – We adopt a “partnership” approach to achieve a “win-win” situation in 

all our relationships

• Sense of Conviction – Our passion and sense of conviction in our business inspire us to deliver 

our goals

Headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia, and listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange, the 

Company is engaged in the exploration, mining and production of gold in Indonesia – a major gold 

producing country. The Group has a concession area of 3,078.5 hectares (“Ciemas Gold Project”) in 

West Java, via two production operation permits (IUP-OP).

The Ciemas Gold Project is rich in gold mineral resources. In the latest Independent Qualified Person’s 

Report (“IQPR”)1, which includes the estimation of gold mineral resources and ore reserves (in 

accordance to JORC 2012) in the Ciemas Gold Project, it was stated that the total mineral resources 

has 46 tonnes of contained Gold, while the Ore reserves has 25 tonnes of contained Gold with an 

average grade of 7.7 g/t of Gold. This reaffirmed the high grade of gold mineral resources within the 

Ciemas Gold Project, as compared to other mines in Asia.

Meanwhile, significant progress has been made in FY2018 towards the startup of the Group’s 

500 tonnes per day Flotation and Carbon-In-Leach mineral processing plant. Barring unforeseen 

circumstances, production at the plant is expected to commence by end of FY2019 (i.e. by June 

2019). This will play a key role in unlocking the potential of the Ciemas Gold Project.

The Group is focused on developing the six prospects where the gold mineral resources have been 

quantified (in accordance to JORC 2012) in the IQPR. Where appropriate, exploration efforts will also 

extend to other mineralised areas within the concession blocks.

1 IQPR dated 30 September 2018 was prepared by independent consultant, SRK Consulting (China) 

Ltd. (“SRK”)

Focusing on What Matters Most

Board Statement | About Wilton Resources Corporation Limited | About this Report | Engaging our Stakeholders | Focusing on What Matters Most |

In order to identify areas in which we should allocate our resources and efforts to create the most 

stakeholder value, we conducted our first formal materiality assessment in April 2018. Guided by 

external sustainability consultants, the process enabled us to determine material ESG matters of 

highest stakeholders’ interest. The process took into account GRI’s Principles for Defining Report 

Content, as detailed in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Wilton’s materiality assessment process

Through the materiality assessment process, four material ESG factors were identified. Our 

stakeholders identified land management (pre- and post- mining) as the most important topic, followed 

by empowering local communities, occupational health and safety, and regulatory compliance.  

Figure 6 below summaries our material ESG factors.

We plan to reassess our material ESG matters when we commence our commercial production, and we 

expect to disclose more material ESG matters progressively, including energy and water consumption, 

waste and wastewater treatment, as well as emissions, amongst others.

and a review of material 

matters as reported by other 

companies in the industry

Zero cases of non-compliance with laws and 

regulatory requirements

• Achieved

We believe that good corporate governance and ethical business conduct form the foundation of 

our business success. We strive to remain accountable to our stakeholders in everything that we do, 

while maintaining compliance to regulatory requirements at all times. The Board and the management 

regularly review and update our policies relating to corporate governance, including risk management 

and anti-corruption, to ensure their continued relevance. Please refer to our 2018 Annual Report 

(pages 22-40) for more details of our corporate governance policies and practices.

All our employees are expected to maintain a professional and ethical conduct in their day-to-day 

dealings. To that end, Wilton has implemented a whistleblowing policy on 9 May 2014, where 

employees can raise concerns about any possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 

other matters of which they become aware of, by directly sending their concerns in writing to the 

Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Company. Further information on this policy is described in 

figure 7 below.

Figure 7: Wilton’s whistleblowing policy

Step 1

• Complaints are to be addressed to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Company 

with the relevant information and evidences to substantiate the complaint

Step 3

• Subject to legal constraints, the complainant will receive information on the outcome of 

the investigation

Step 2

Investigations may be conducted with consideration given to the following factors:

• Severity of issue raised

• Credibility of the concern or information

• Likelihood of verifying the concern or information from attributable sources

In 2013, through our subsidiaries, PT. Wilton Wahana Indonesia and PT. Liektucha Ciemas, we attained 

the “Clean and Clear” certification by the Directorate General of Minerals and Coal. This certification 

is given to companies that have fully complied with the relevant Indonesian environmental and mining 

laws and regulation in conducting mining operations.

As a testament to our effective corporate governance policies and practices, we were awarded the 

Most Transparent Company Award under the mining and quarrying category at the Securities Investors 

Association (Singapore) (“SIAS”) 19th Investors’ Choice Awards held in September 2018.

There were also zero reported cases of non-compliance with all laws and regulations, a record that we 

aim to maintain in subsequent years.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

Figure 8: Wilton’s sustainability governance structure

At Wilton, our sustainability approach is driven by the directives and inputs from the Board of Directors 

and top management. The Executive Chairman and President is involved in all decisions relating to 

sustainability policies and initiatives. The management and monitoring of sustainability are overseen 

by the Vice President (General Administration), who is assisted by the Vice President (Operations) 

and the Vice President (Technical and Development). Collectively, they ensure the implementation of 

sustainability policies and practices in respective departments. Subsequently, the information about 

Wilton’s sustainability progress is shared regularly with the Board for review of existing sustainability 

initiatives.

FY2018 Performance

Land reclamation

Reclaim 230 hectares (“ha”) of land area at the  

post-mining stage, as laid out in Wilton’s Reclamation 

Plan that was submitted to the Ministry of Energy 

and Mineral Resources (Mineral and Coal division) 

of Indonesia

Wilton has not reached 

the post-mining stage

To minimise any land disturbance that could occur from mining activities, Wilton prefers to carry out 

underground mining before exploring open pit mining. We aim to restore the function of any disturbed 

environment to its original and/or intended purposes through reclamation and rehabilitation efforts. 

We uphold this commitment by providing a monetary deposit for reclamation to the government 

and by developing a mine closure plan which contains a reclamation plan before commencing our 

mining activities. This reclamation plan is approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 

(Mineral and Coal division) of Indonesia and serves as a guide for our rehabilitation efforts during and 

after our mining activities. Through the reclamation efforts, we aim to mitigate negative impact to the 

environment at post-mining stage, such as acid mine drainage. Figure 9 summarises our plans for land 

management at the post-mining stage.

Figure 9: Wilton’s plans for land management at the post-mining stage

Destruction of 

mining facilities

• At the post-mining stage, our mining facilities will be destructed  

gradually so as not to endanger the public

• These mining facilities refer to equipment installation, buildings and 

other supporting facilities (e.g. storage area for explosives)

Land reclamation

• As the land topography at our mining site is bumpy and steep, we will 

build terraces to slow down surface flow (to a speed that does not  

damage the soil) and improve the ease of soil cultivation

• We plan to cover the holes from our mining activities with top soil to be 

planted with cover crops

• In addition, the former mining area which is inundated with water will 

be used for fish farming

Erosion control

• Erosion control will be done through vegetative technique and  

mechanical technique

• Vegetative technique refers to planting of vegetation to recover the 

function and ecosystem structure of our mining area to its original state

• The choice of vegetation will be made based on ecological and  

economical considerations, such as ecological benefits; ability to 

produce raw materials that fulfill the local community’s needs; market 

demand for the crops, amongst others

• On the other hand, mechanical technique refers to the setting up of 

wooden/bamboo structures to prevent landslide

Hydrological and 

surface water 

management

• Construction of drainage and sedimentation ponds

• Effluent is to be treated at sedimentation ponds prior to discharge into 

nearby rivers

• The quality of effluent is tested and monitored daily to ensure 

compliance with regulatory limits

Soil fertility control

• Introduction of organic matter and microorganisms to help improve 

soil fertility

Employee Demographics

Governance and Ethics | Land Management | Employee Demographics | Occupational Health and Safety | Empowering Local Communities | GRI Content Index

In FY2018, we were supported by 38 full-time employees under permanent contract. In addition 

to these employees, we were supported by other outsourced workers who provided cleaning and 

security services at our offices, as well as mining services at our mine. Over 80% of our employees are 

in Indonesia, where our mine is located in. While our gender breakdown indicates a higher proportion 

of males, this could be attributed to the fact that the nature of our mining activities traditionally attracts 

male rather than female employees. In FY2018, nine employees left the company; but this was more 

than offset by 12 new hires in the same year.

Zero cases of work-related accidents

• Achieved

Our employees are the backbone of our business. We are cognizant that they are the drivers who move 

our business forward, enabling us to achieve our targets and objectives. One of our commitments to 

our employees is to make their safety our priority. This is especially vital in the mining industry which 

we operate in, where safety risks are heightened. At Wilton, occupational health and safety (“OHS”) is 

driven by our “Zero Accident Committee”, which is headed by our Mining Head and Deputy Mining 

Head and supported by the project management team at the site.

There were zero cases of fatality, work-related accidents and occupational diseases in FY2018. To 

maintain this record, we strive to continually strengthen our OHS management. We are in the process 

of formalising our OHS policy and are looking to obtain ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety 

Management System) certification for our operations, both of which are targeted for completion by 

2019.

Empowering Local Communities

Board Statement | About Wilton Resources Corporation Limited | About this Report | Engaging our Stakeholders | Focusing on What Matters Most |

Our operational site is in the midst of the local communities. We view this as an opportunity to improve 

their lives and help them grow together with us. One of the ways in which we do this is by providing job 

opportunities for them at our mine. Besides enabling the local communities to earn their livelihood, we 

hope to equip them with skillsets through on-the-job training.

In addition, we have implemented the “Wilton Care” programme through which we carry out Corporate 

Social Responsibility (“CSR”) activities and invest in the local communities.
