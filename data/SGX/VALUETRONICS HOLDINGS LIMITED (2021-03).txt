ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE



Established in 1992 and headquartered in Hong Kong, 

Valuetronics was listed on the SGX Mainboard in

providers with a multi-location manufacturing footprint 

in China and South East Asia, which also focuses on a 

proactive engagement with customers so as to understand 

market and industry trends and initiate product-oriented 

solutions to meet their ever-changing needs.

Our proactive customer engagement leverages on our 

Design and Development (“D&amp;D”) capabilities, which 

is supported by integrated manufacturing capabilities 

from plastic tool fabrication and injection moulding, 

to surface mount technology and full turnkey finished 

product assembly. As a one-stop manufacturing solution 

provider, this sets us apart from traditional EMS providers. 

Our capability in providing vertical integrated services 

under one roof gives our customers the advantage of a 

faster time-to-market, better quality control, and most 

importantly, a competitive total cost of ownership.



Our wide product manufacturing capability and range 

of customers from emerging enterprises to top global 

multinational corporations, is a testimony to the success 

in adopting this philosophy. It also highlights our ability 

to accommodate customers’ requirements for various 

volume mix, complexity and industrial standards, while 

demonstrating our spectrum of competence. By constantly 

focusing on their objectives, priorities, and needs, we 

continue to develop long-term relationships with our 

global customers in the consumer, commercial, industrial, 

automotive and medical equipment industries.

Today, we are a premier design, manufacturing partner for 

the world’s leading brands in various sectors, which span 

across a wide geographical region that covers America, 

Europe and the Asia Pacific. We support these clients 

supply chain requirements and multi-site production 

strategy by leveraging on our multiple manufacturing sites 

located in China and Vietnam. We currently have a 110,000 

sqm China Campus located at Huizhou City, Guandong 

Province, PRC and a 4,000 sqm leased standard factory at 

Binh Xuyen District, Vinh Phuc Province, Vietnam. We are 

currently building our own 52,541 sqm Vietnam Campus, 

which is located in the same industrial park as the existing 

factory, and it is targeted to start mass production by 

the last quarter of financial year ending 31 March 2022 

(“FY2022”).

So at Valuetronics, we deliver not only just products, but 

total solutions that meet the needs of our diverse client 

base.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our stakeholders and the material aspects relevant to our 

business. Regular engagement with our stakeholders provides a core input for determining our material focus areas. We engage 

internal and external stakeholders to understand their concerns and emerging priorities. This enables us to initiate collaboration 

and be part of formulating or facilitating solution. These key stakeholders include, but not limited to, customers, suppliers, 

employees, investors, and local government. We adopt both formal and informal channels of communication to understand 

the needs of our key stakeholders and incorporate their feedback into the evolution of corporate strategies to achieve mutually 

beneficial relationships.

OUR APPROACH

TO SUSTAINABILITY

MATERIAL ASPECTS ASSESSMENT

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant aspects. Relevant aspects are then prioritised as material 

factors, which are then validated. The end result of this process is a list of material factors disclosed in this sustainability report 

of which their inter-relationships are shown below:

ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENTAL

SOCIAL

GOVERNANCE

A materiality review is conducted every year, incorporating inputs from our various stakeholder engagements. The Group has 

conducted a materiality assessment during the year with the help of an external consultant.

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, environment and society, as well 

as its influence on stakeholders. Aspects were identified and prioritised through internal workshops, peer reviews and social 

impact assessments at site level. Applying the guidance from GRI, we have identified the following material aspects:

• Economic performance

• Anti-corruption

• Environmental 

compliance

• Supplier environmental 

assessment

• Diversity

• Fair employment 

practices and child 

labour

• Occupational health and 

safety

• Training and education

• Local community

ECONOMIC

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Considering its FY2021 results performance, the extremely 

difficult business environment, and the capital expenditure 

needs of the Company given its Vietnam expansion, the Board 

proposed a Final Dividend of HK 16 cents per share for FY2021, 

which are subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual 

General Meeting to be convened. The Company has also paid 

an Interim Dividend of HK 5 cents per share in December 2020 

and in aggregate, the Interim and Final dividends amount to 

HK 21 cents per share (FY2020: 20 HK cents per share).

The aggregate dividend amount is approximately 48.9% of 

the net profit attributable to shareholders for FY2021 and is 

in line with the Company’s formal dividend policy of paying 

out between 30% to 50% of net profit as normal dividends to 

shareholders. The Company will continue to adhere to this 

formal dividend policy.

The Group’s FY2021 revenue decreased by 3.1% to HK$2,281.5 

million from HK$2,354.4 million in the financial year ended 31 

With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to evolve and disrupt the global economy, 

the operating environment for FY2022 will remain uncertain and challenging. As we 

deal with the greater volatility, supply chain challenges, and the ongoing Sino-US 

trade tensions, we expect our financial results for FY2022 to be significantly lower 

compared to FY2021. While we deal with this unprecedented scenario and mitigate 

the situation by diversifying our supply chain and re-negotiating prices with our 

customers, we have still managed to successfully expand to Vietnam, because of our 

dedicated management team and expatriate team in Vietnam, who were supported 

by resources from our China campus, include those that travelled to Vietnam and 

those who provided remote support on a continuous basis. 

Mr Ricky Tse Chong Hing

Chairman and Managing Director

March 2020 (“FY2020“). Gross profit correspondingly increased 

by 6.5% to HK$386.2 million in FY2021 from HK$362.8 million in 

FY2020, with gross profit margin increasing by 1.5 percentage 

point to 16.9% for FY2021 due to a change in product sales mix 

during the year. As a result, Valuetronics achieved a net profit 

attributable to shareholders of HK$187.1 million for FY2021, 

which translates into earnings per share of approximately 

HK43.0 cents.

As at 31 March 2021, the Group’s financial position remains 

stable and resilient with a net asset value per share (excluding 

treasury shares) of HK$3.1 (31 March 2020: HK$2.8). The 

Group has net current assets of HK$975.3 million (31 March 

2020: HK$902.4 million), total assets of HK$2,241.6 million 

(31 March 2020: HK$2,013.5 million) and a shareholders’ fund 

of HK$1,347.1 million (31 March 2020: HK$1,231.6 million). 

Supported by strong operating cash flows, the Group continues 

to have no bank borrowings and has cash and cash equivalents 

of HK$1,129.4 million as at 31 March 2021.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Here at Valuetronics, we do not tolerate corruption in any form. This has been made clear to our employees, suppliers and business 

partners. Valuetronics ensures that all staff (other than production line workers) sign an anti-corruption declaration when they 

join the Company. Dedicated whistleblowing hotlines using both email and electronic platforms are set up so that if anyone who 

wants to report any business ethics issue can do so confidentially, and any report of corruption is immediately escalated to the 

attention of senior management.

There have been no reported incidents of corruption in the Group during FY2021 (FY2020: NIL). We have achieved the target 

we set last year. We aim to achieve zero incidents of corruption in the future as well. We will continue to monitor and prevent 

its occurrence as targeted. We will also continue to ensure that all employees are fully aware of our policy and sign our anti-

corruption declaration.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Valuetronics has achieved the ISO14000 accreditation and standards for environmental management since 2008 for our China 

operation. ISO14000 is based on a plan-do-check-act (“PDCA”) methodology which provides a systematic framework for the 

integration of environmental management practices by supporting environmental protection, preventing pollution, minimising 

waste, reducing energy and material use. Recyclable waste is stored, collected and processed by qualified third party recycling 

firms.

For our leased manufacturing facility in Vietnam, we have passed the environmental impact compliance inspection and started trial 

production in May 2020. To extend our company philosophy on environmental protection and environmental regulatory compliance 

to Vietnam. Our leased factory has been accredited with ISO14000 Environmental Management System since April 2021.

We are committed to continue the PDCA approach to improve our environment management, targeting environmental protection, 

environmental regulatory compliance and no major non-conformities in any kind of environmental compliance audits in both of 

our China and Vietnam operations. There were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental-related laws and regulations 

resulting in significant fines or sanctions in FY2021 (FY2020: NIL), and we endeavour to maintain this track record in FY2022.

SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

To raise environmental awareness among our suppliers, Valuetronics encourages suppliers to be accredited with the ISO14000 

standard. With regard to raw materials that might contain environmentally hazardous substances, the Group has been working 

closely with suppliers to push forward more environmental protection awareness with suppliers required to make annual 

declaration on their ISO14000 compliance. We have performed our annual assessment for all our Printed Circuit Board (“PCB”) 

suppliers as well as our top 100 suppliers in terms of purchasing amount, and they are required to make an annual environmental 

compliance declaration. 

In FY2021, we have achieved our target as the majority of the assessed suppliers declared that they have accredited with ISO14000 

standard or have complied with local government laws and regulations on environmental issues. Out of these suppliers assessed, 

all our PCB suppliers have declared that they have accredited with ISO14000 standard or have complied with local government 

laws and regulations on environmental issues.

We will continue to raise environmental awareness among our suppliers in FY2022. Our top 100 suppliers and PCB suppliers will 

be assessed and screened annually, with a focus on their compliance on environmental issues.

DIVERSITY

Valuetronics maintains a policy of providing equal opportunities to all its employees. The Group’s recruitment of employees 

and their subsequent annual appraisal are based on merit, work attitude, cooperation with other staff, and their efficiency and 

effectiveness of work.

Furthermore, the Group does not discriminate according to race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, physical 

impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality.

Similar to the previous year, we have maintained an almost equal ratio of male to female employees. Our objective is to have no 

incidents of discrimination and there has been no reported discrimination issue during FY2021 (FY2020: NIL). We will continue to 

maintain zero incident of discrimination within the Group throughout the years.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND CHILD LABOUR

The Group considers its employees the most valuable asset 

and offers them fair and competitive remuneration packages. 

Discretionary incentives are granted to eligible employees 

based on the performance of the Group as well as the individual 

employee. We continue to provide employment opportunities 

to local students by closely cooperating with local colleges 

and universities and to provide nurturing programmes for 

fresh graduates. Valuetronics will continue to provide a fair 

employment environment.

The Group has a strict no child labour policy and expects the 

same from all of our suppliers. Declaration is made on our new 

supplier application form and as a part of the annual supplier 

assessment. All our top 100 suppliers comply with our no child 

labour policy. Our target is to eliminate child labor throughout 

our operations, including at our suppliers. 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) of our workforce 

has always been one of our priorities. Valuetronics is pleased 

to confirm that there has been no fatal industrial accident 

reported in FY2021. Our Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) 

department is independent from operational departments and 

monitors the following measures to provide a safe working 

environment for all employees:

• Identifying potential risks through routine campus patrols 

and drawing up and implementing preventive actions;

• Analysing each incident for its root causes and 

communicating with all the relevant department 

managers for corrective actions and implementing 

preventive measures;

• Conducting regular training for employees on safety 

practices;

• Conducting regular checks for emission compliance;

• Reinforcing the occupational health and safety awareness 

by providing trainings, putting up banners and posters in 

public areas;

• Closely following and ensuring compliance with the 

government’s rules and regulations on EHS;

• Ensuring fire safety management protocols are in place; 

performing routine check on fire safety; and

• Carrying out regular fire drills and training.

SOCIAL

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (CONTINUED)

In addition, the EHS department chairs regular health and safety meetings with all operational department managers to discuss 

occupational health and safety issues, focusing on the risks identified above. Immediate corrective actions are carried out for each 

EHS incident, which is followed by a formal review for further prevention. The EHS department also verifies the implementation 

and effectiveness of any corrective actions.

No fatal industrial accident was reported during FY2021 (FY2020: NIL) as targeted, and we will continue to ensure that there is no 

case of fatal industrial accident in the factory in the future as well.

COVID-19 Safety Measures

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the OHS of the Group’s workforce is a top priority. The Group will strictly adhere to all 

administrative guidelines and containment measures issued by the authorities in China and Vietnam. The Group’s factories 

in China and Vietnam already have various safe distancing and hygiene practices in place at all its manufacturing sites. 

These include temperature monitoring, social distancing among workers, the widespread use of facemasks, designated 

entrances and exits to control human traffic, the use of telecommunication to prevent unnecessary human contact, and the 

regularly disinfection of facilities. Workers are also required to declare their travel history so that those that visited high 

risk areas can be quarantined on return as a precaution.

SOCIAL

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

Valuetronics provides its employees with an orientation program and regular trainings.

The orientation program is organised for new employees to introduce the Company and its operations as well as its codes of 

conduct, applicable internal and external rules and regulations, and workplace safety practices.

For workers, regular training is provided for job-related skills and updates on workplace safety. For staff, in addition to workplace 

safety training, more specialised training is also held to ensure that they keep pace with the growth and development of the Group.  

Staff training records are reviewed and specific training needs are identified for the individual’s career advancement. Our in-house 

training records showed that at the Group level, each staff averaged 5 hours for FY2021 (FY2020: 18 hours). Valuetronics places 

importance in ensuring the competency of its employees to serve all stakeholders. However, training sessions have been impacted 

by the strict restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have consequently prevented large group trainings from 

occurring and thus a relatively lower hours averaged as compared to the previous year.

The Company is committed to enhance the newly set-up operations in Vietnam FY2020 and has devoted a significant amount of 

time in training its employees. The average training hours for Vietnam staff is 16 hours for FY2021. We will continue to deploy our 

resources and offer training courses to our employees to enhance their professional competence. 

LOCAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

Valuetronics strongly believes in being a socially responsible corporate citizen. While the Company is determined to give back to 

the community and aims to organise at least one community activity per quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic has halted execution of 

all corporate responsibility efforts planned for the past year.

GOVERNANCE

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

At Valuetronics, we believe that strong corporate governance is key to a sustainable business. That is why since our listing on the 

SGX Mainboard in 2007 and all through to FY2021, we have continued to comply with the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance. 

Please refer to pages 13 to 31 of our Annual Report, for details of our compliance to the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance.

We have achieved the target we set last year. We will continue to ensure compliance with the SGX requirements.

As an integrated EMS provider, it is a continual challenge to successfully manage our environmental and social issues. Nevertheless, 

Valuetronics has incorporated these issues into our business model and implemented the applicable sustainable and responsible 

practices to mitigate these issues throughout the Company. Our products also meet the stringent safety and environmental 

requirements demanded by our customers.

Valuetronics pays strict attention to the implementation of good labour practices in all our operations. The Group also provides 

various training opportunities for continued employee development and this is reflected in the quality and delivery of our products 

and services. We value our relationships with our clients and the wider community in which we operate in, and these strong 

relationships have helped us through the challenging times in the past. Valuetronics strongly believes that in the long run, these

efforts will have a positive impact on our economic performance.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (“ERM”)

ERM is an integral part of good corporate governance as well as resources management. Valuetronics has a thorough and 

comprehensive ERM framework to identify and manage its risks and exposures in an integrated, systematic and consistent 

manner. For detailed disclosure on ERM, please refer to pages 24-25 of our Annual Report.

We performed risk assessment exercise and achieved the target we set in FY2020. We aim to perform risk assessments annually 

and disclose in accordance with SGX requirements.

BUSINESS ETHICS

When it comes to hiring, Valuetronics takes any possibility of conflict of interest into serious consideration. Our code of conduct 

clearly spells out our expectations from our staff and the subsequent consequences if any of the rules are violated or when 

standards not met. In addition, we also have fair grievance procedures.

The Group also takes measures to guard against cybersecurity risks in order to protect confidential information for both our 

internal and external stakeholders. This also applies to our employment process where the privacy of all applicants is safeguarded 

and access to personal data is restricted to authorised persons on a strict need-to-know basis.

All of our staff are reminded of the importance of upholding the highest standards when it comes to business ethics. We have 

incorporated business ethics and codes of conduct into our new joiner orientation program, so that all of our employees are fully 

aware that our compliance with rules and regulations is a key part of running a responsible business.

Valuetronics has complied, in all material aspects, with applicable environmental rules and regulations, anti-competitive behaviour 

laws, and requirements on health and safety. For FY2021, we have achieved our target to comply with applicable environmental 

rules and regulations, anti-competitive behavior laws, and requirements on health and safety. There were no (FY2020: NIL) 

significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for any non-compliance with the aforementioned laws, regulations and requirements. 

There have also been no reported incidents of corruption during the reporting period. It is Valuetronics’ goal to maintain zero 

incidents of corruption, and we regularly review our policies on whistleblowing and anti-corruption so as to ensure that they are 

effective. We will continue to aim for zero incident of non-compliance in the following years.
