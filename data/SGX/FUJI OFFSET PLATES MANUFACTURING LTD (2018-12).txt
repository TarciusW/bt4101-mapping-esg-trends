Stakeholder Engagement &amp; Materiality Assessment 

 

The Sustainability Consultants (the “Consultants”) worked with the Steering Committee 

to conduct a materiality assessment to identify the relevant EESG topics of which the 

Group considered important to stakeholders. Stakeholders includes shareholders, 

suppliers, customers, management and employees. The Group engages shareholders 

through annual general meetings, customers and suppliers through industry forums 

and employees through regular internal meetings. 

 

The material topics were evaluated for its potential impact on the environment and 

society, its influence on the stakeholders and impact on the Group’s operations.  

 

The Steering Committee aims to conduct an annual review of the Group’s material 

topics as well as monitor the performance of the topics as part of the Group’s 

sustainability strategy. 

 

The Group adopts a four-step process to define the material topics:

subsidiary, Fuji Roto Gravure, located in Johor, Malaysia. 

 

Economic Performance (GRI 201-1) 

 

Economic performance is defined as our most material topic because our economic 

success ensures our long-term viability and enables the execution of our sustainability 

strategies. 

For FY2018, the Group recorded a profit after tax from continuing operations of S$3.53 

million as compared with a loss after tax of S$0.04 million for FY2017.

For FY2018, the Group is in a healthy financial position with revenue of S$5.02 million 

and is in a net equity position of S$31.21 million as compared to revenue of S$5.06 

million and net equity of S$24.26 million for FY2017. 

For a detailed breakdown of our FY2018 financial results, please refer to the Group’s 

Annual Report for FY2018. 

 

Reducing Energy Usage for Production (GRI 302-1) 

 

The Group recognises the importance of properly managing and regulating energy 

consumption so as to keep operational costs low and also to reduce the impact on the 

environment. As such, this topic is deemed to be material to the Group. To keep track 

of its energy consumption, there is a monitoring system in place and a group of trained 

individuals in its maintenance team at the Production Plant. 

The following graphs (based on computed electricity bill for the entire Production Plant) 

show the total energy consumption and the total output from FY2016 to FY2018.

The graph below shows the energy consumption per output level (inclusive of energy 

consumed) at the Production Plant: 

 

 

The increase in the energy used per cylinder for FY2018 is mainly attributed to the 

following reasons: 

1. The amount of energy required to start up the machines is constant regardless 

of the output per day, even though the output in FY2018 was 1,000 cylinders 

lower than in FY2017, Energy used per output was higher given the lower base 

of total output in FY2018.  

2. The machines used for production are considered more energy inefficient 

compared to the previous year due to ageing factor. Due to the substantial 

costs involved in replacing older machines, only a small fraction of older 

machines (4 machines) have been replaced since end-2018 and the Group 

targets to replace 2 machines every year. 

The Group’s target is to reduce this consumption per output ratio by around 5% for 

FY2019.  The Group intends to achieve this target by adopting the following measures: 

1. Replacing older machines as stated above. 

2. Posting reminders on the walls of the production area to remind employees to 

switch off lightings or any electrical appliances which are not in use; 

3. Setting air-conditioning at a minimum of 25 degrees Celsius; 

Overall energy consumption is analysed monthly by the Accounts Manager. Energy 

usage not within the trends are identified within different operational areas and 

investigated for possible faults in the usage methods or the instruments and machinery 

used.  With these practices established, the Group aims to improve efficiency in energy 

usage.

Health and Safety of Employees (GRI 403-2) 

The Group has set an objective which is to raise health and safety standards in the 

workplace so as to achieve zero or minimal cases of reportable serious work-related 

injuries. The Group is committed to provide a safe working environment for its 

employees to safeguard the health and safety of all employees, which it believes will 

greatly enhance morale and satisfaction leading to higher productivity. As such, this 

topic is deemed to be material to the Group. The Group is pleased to report that there 

has not been any reportable serious work-related injuries in the past 5 years.  

All production employees are constantly reminded to be careful during work and to 

wear the appropriate safety equipment. Trainings and briefings are constantly provided 

at the Production Plant and communicated to new and existing employees to 

understand the rules and safety regulations before the start of each work day.  

Reminder messages are also pasted around the production area to reinforce these 

values accordingly. 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) officer at the Production 

Plant carries out monthly inspection on workplace safety. The OSHA officer will 

perform spot-checks to ensure employees are wearing the correct safety equipment 

and conforming to the safety rules and regulations. There are fire safety inspections 

every quarter at the Production Plant and the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia 

performs annual checks to ensure that the necessary requirements are met. 

The Group strictly complies with the following regulations established by the following 

agencies: 

1. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (“DOSH”) - the objective of this 

agency is to prevent industrial accidents and occupational diseases.  It also 

ensures safety, health and welfare of people at work as well as protecting other 

people from the safety and health hazards arising from production activities; 

and 

 

2. Department of Environment (“DOE”) – the objective of this agency is to achieve 

abatement of pollution in the country through the enforcement of the 

Environmental Quality Act of 1974 and its subsidiary legislation. It monitors air 

and water quality and noise, manages toxic and hazardous wastes based on 

the “cradle-to-grave” principle.

Training and Education for Employees (GRI 404-1) 

Training and education is an important topic for the Group as it enhances productivity 

of all employees by equipping them with the necessary skillsets to perform their duties 

in an ever-changing working environment.  Training and education helps employees 

to learn specific knowledge or skills to improve performance in their current roles that 

brings a greater impact to the Group, which is of utmost importance. 

The training process is as follows: 

 

Management will also choose some safety courses which are open to all employees. 

The Group has been consistently providing all employees with both internal and 

external training for them to perform their job duties efficiently whenever necessary. 

The total training hours provided to employees in the Group can be found in the 

following graphs below: 

 

 

Note: Total training hours is inclusive of 360 hours for the biennial fire safety training in FY2018, which explains the spike in 

training hours in FY2018, and one-off training of 80 hours for handling waste and effluents for the OSHA officer.

The Group recorded 764 training hours in FY2018, which was substantially higher than 

the 256 training hours in FY2016 and FY2017, primarily due to the 360 hours attributed 

to the mandatory biennial fire safety training for employees and 80 hours attributed to 

training on handling waste and effluents attended by the OSHA officer (female, 

executive category).  

Excluding the 440 hours attributed to the specified training courses above, there is a 

slight increase in training hours (324 hours compared to 256 hours) for general courses, 

which the Group targets to further increase by around 5% for the following year.  

The Group believes that its investment in training for employees will ultimately enhance 

productivity and enable it to identify and exploit new opportunities in the printing 

cylinder business and beyond.
