“Group” or “Karin” or “we” or “us”) is pleased to present the first sustainability report (the “Report”) to share 

with our stakeholders our management approach to sustainability, our practice and performance, as well as our 

plans for the coming years.  

Reporting Period and Cycle 

[GRI 102-50, 102-52] 

The Report illustrates the overall performance of Karin regarding the economic, environmental and social area 

from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 (“FY 2018”). It will be published annually.

the Report to include other business and locations progressively. If the scope and boundaries of the specific 

contents vary, they are noted in the relevant section of the Report.  

Reporting Framework 

[GRI 102-54] 

The Report is prepared in accordance with Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. The 

GRI Standards is an internationally recognised framework and was selected for its universal application for 

reporting on a range of economic, environmental and social performance. The Report also complies with the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Rules (711A and 711B) and the Singapore 

Exchange Limited (SGX) Sustainability Reporting Guide. The Report should also be read in conjunction with 

the Annual Report 2018. We have adopted a phased approach to our reporting and will seek to provide 

additional disclosures over time. 

Reporting Principles 

The content of the Report is prepared based on four principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability 

context, materiality and completeness 

� “Stakeholder Inclusiveness” Principle:  

The Group identifies its stakeholders, and explain how it has responded to their reasonable expectations 

and interests. 

� “Sustainability Context” Principle:  

The Report presents the Group’s performance in the wider context of sustainability.  

� “Materiality” Principle:  

The Group determines material topics by stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment. 


 

4 

� “Completeness” 

The Report includes coverage of material topics and their boundaries, sufficient to reflect significant 

economic, environmental, and social impacts, and to enable stakeholders to assess the Group’s 

performance in the reporting period. 

Restatement 

[GRI 102-48] 

It does not apply as this is the first sustainability report.

accuracy of information. Performance data for the corresponding material topic is reported in good faith and to 

the best of our knowledge. The data is verified using internal mechanism, and checks. Financial statements

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

[GRI 102-46, 102-47, 103-1] 

Karin’s core approach to sustainability and business strategies is to identify, prioritise and manage the material 

aspects of our business that impact the environment, society and economy most. Our Board members and 

senior management team prioritises and identifies the most material economic, environmental and social 

impacts of our business operations through reviewing our existing company policies, compliance requirements, 

employee surveys, risk registers and benchmarking material issues reported by peers. While assessing our 

sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities, we considered the expectations and concerns of our critical 

stakeholders. We also examined sustainability trends in the industry sector and reporting practices of peer 

companies. Through this exercise, we identified and prioritised material topics as shown in the following table. 

Material topics have been reviewed and approved by our Board.

ECONOMIC 

Anti-corruption 

[GRI 103, GRI 205-3] 

Karin is committed to fostering a culture of corporate compliance, ethical behaviour and good corporate 

governance. We accept zero tolerance towards corruption and manage the risks through prevention and 

detection of frauds and irregularities. The Group strictly abides by the laws and regulations relating to bribery, 

extortion, fraud and money laundering in Hong Kong, including the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and 

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance. 

The Group’s Employee Handbook sets out the employee’s conducts in dealing with problems related to 

acceptance of advantages and conflicts of interest so as to educate the importance of ethics and integrity.  

Other than the internal anti-bribery and corruption guidelines as stipulated in the Employee Handbook the 

Group has in place a Whistleblowing Policy, which is publicly posted on our website, as a communication 

channel for employees to report concerns relating to ethical business or personal conduct, accounting and 

financial matters, integrity and professionalism, or allegations of retaliation for having reported matters in good 

faith. Employees are welcomed to send his/her concerns via email anonymously. The Group has also 

implemented appropriate and effective internal controls at different business processes to prevent and detect 

fraudulent activities. The Group also provides training for employees relating to anti-corruption. Fraud 

assessment exercise is conducted annually and reported to the Board. 

In FY 2018, the Group was not aware of any confirmed incidents of corruption. Moving forward, the Group will 

continue to implement whistleblowing and other policies to prevent corruption and maintain zero confirmed 

incidents for corruption. 


 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

Energy and Emissions 

[GRI 103, 302-1, 302-3, 305-1,305-2,305-4] 

Karin is committed to minimising the environmental impact of our business through resources utilisation and 

conservation. We notice that there is a gradual concern from the community on climate changes due to the 

increase in energy consumption and its incurred greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Group’s warehouses 

and offices consume electricity for lighting, air conditioning, office equipment and other uses. The Group has 

implemented energy-saving strategies in the office to mitigate energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas 

emissions. Some key practices implemented are as follows: 

� Switch off electrical appliances when they are not in use (such as air-conditioning, computer, printer, 

photocopier, lighting, etc.) 

� During summertime, maintain an average indoor temperature between 24 - 26°C to save energy 

� Install thermometers in different area of the office to monitor the temperature 

� Use energy-saving light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent lamps, T5 fluorescent lamps, LED, etc. 

� Set the computer in energy-saving mode 

� Do not leave the computer on standby mode for too long. They should be completely shut off to save 

electricity 

� Choose electrical appliances with “Grade 1” energy label (such as refrigerator, air conditioner, etc.) 

whenever possible 

� Encourage staff to use stairways instead of lift 

In FY 2018, the performance of the energy consumption and its associated greenhouse gas emissions are as 

follows: 

Performance Indicators

GHG Emissions Intensity (tonnes CO2 equivalent/ft2) 

0.007 

Moving forward, the Group will continue to implement energy-saving practices, monitor the consumption data 

to seek possibilities for expansion of the scope and target setting.  

 

2 Scope 2 refers to the “indirect energy” emissions from the internal purchased electricity consumption by the Group. 

3 The GHG emission calculation is estimated with reference to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and 2018 

Sustainability Report published by CLP Holdings Limited. 


 

SOCIAL 

Employment 

[GRI 103, 401-1, 401-2] 

Karin believes that the continued service of our management team and skilled employees is one of our key 

success factors. Having a team of experienced management staff and skilled personnel is critical in 

maintaining the quality of our services and our relationship with our customers. A high turnover of such 

personnel without suitable and timely replacement will adversely affect our operations and competitiveness. 

The Group strictly abides by the laws and regulations relating to employment in Hong Kong, including the 

Employment Ordinance, Minimum Wage Ordinance, the Employees’ Compensation Ordinance and the Sex 

Discrimination Ordinance. 

As the business grows, Karin must establish sustainable human capital to attract and retain talents. The Group 

has formulated policies and initiatives with respect to discrimination, compensations, promotion, privacy and 

other relating matters. The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities to all its employees. The 

Group’s recruitment of employees and their subsequent annual appraisal are based on merit, work attitude, 

cooperation with other staff &amp; workers, and their efficiency and effectiveness of work. Furthermore, the Group 

does not discriminate according to race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, physical 

impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality.  

Remuneration, promotion and dismissal 

The Group determines employees’ remunerations based on factors such as qualifications, duties, contributions 

and experience. We have a robust system to assess the performance of the employees, which forms the basis 

of determination on salary increments, bonus and promotion.  

For employee termination, employment might be terminated for non-performance, breach of policies, gross 

misconduct. For voluntary resignation, an exit interview is conducted with the resigned employee so the Group 

would identify employee concern or dissatisfaction. 

Working hours and rest periods 

The Group committed to offering reasonable working hours and rest period to employees. Employees usually 

work on average 40 hours per week. Employee's working hours may be re-scheduled by his supervisor to suit 

operational needs. All employees shall be entitled to General Holidays as announced in the Hong Kong SAR 

Government Gazette each year. In addition to general holidays, employees are entitled to annual leave, 

birthday leave, marriage leave, maternity leave and sick leave. 

 


 

16 

Employee benefits and welfare  

According to the applicable laws and regulations in Hong Kong, the Group provides various benefits and 

welfare to the employees. The Group participates in the defined contribution scheme (the “MPF Scheme”) 

under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance which is available to its employees in Hong Kong. 

Contributions to the MPF Scheme by the Group and employees are made based on a percentage of 

employees’ basic salaries. The Group’s employer contributions vest fully with the employees when contributed 

to the MPF Scheme. The Group also provides medical insurance and compensation insurance. The Group 

provides monetary awards, such as discretionary bonus, share options to employees. 

Creating a cohesive workplace and promote team bonding, Karin organised various engaging events for our 

employees, including Christmas Party, Spring Lunch and leisure trip. To promote health and wellness among 

employees, we also supported our employees to participate in the Oxfam Trailwalker 2017, Standard 

Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2018 and Corporate Games organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services 

Department (LCSD). In FY 2018, there were over 300 participants involved in the events mentioned above.

[GRI 103, 403-5, 403-6, 403-9] 

Karin attaches great importance to the health of its employees and is committed to providing a safe and healthy 

working environment for them. The Group maintains medical insurance for its employees and adopts practices 

regarding work safety and occupational health issues. Safety arrangements in cases of emergency such as 

during typhoons and rainstorm warnings are stated in the Employee Handbook to ensure that all employees 

are aware of emergency procedures. The guidance for manual handling operation is specifically introduced to 

employees who work in the warehouse in the orientation training. In FY 2018, the Group was not aware of any 

case of work-related injury, occupational disease nor fatality. 

Moving forward, the Group will continue to educate new employees about the manual handling operations and 

review if any material risks in this area.  

 


 

19 

Training and Education 

[GRI 103, 404-3] 

Karin places a great deal of importance on the career development and training of our employees. Due to the 

technical nature of our business, staff training is important in ensuring that we keep ourselves abreast of 

product knowledge and the changing needs of our customers. 

The Group has in place procedures to provide a system and instruction for determining training and 

competence development needs, providing training and maintaining training records. It also sets out 

organizational knowledge and how it is available to the extent necessary.  

Our staff regularly attends scheduled training courses and seminars, including those conducted and sponsored 

by our MNC suppliers and component manufacturers, to enable our technical staff to become more familiar 

with existing and new IT infrastructure, computer data storage management products and new component 

applications. These courses serve to enhance our awareness of the latest products or upgrades available. 

These courses also offer in-depth knowledge in some of the latest technologies and insight into the current 

market trends and other economic factors affecting the electronics industry. Our staff who attends such training 

courses will disseminate the knowledge gained to the rest of the team through internal meetings and training 

seminars. In addition, technical knowledge is also acquired through on-the-job training where guidance and 

supervision are provided by the more experienced staff. 

We also place a strong emphasis on developing our management staff through courses which focus on 

developing management and analytical skills. Our management staff also attends regular industry seminars 

and conferences which address general technological trends, developments in the electronics industry and 

economic factors and policies that affect our business.
