SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017



Being in the hospitality business, 

we are in a privileged position to 

raise awareness on the importance 

of sustainability and allow our 

customers to participate in some of 

the sustainability initiatives during 

their stay with us in our hotels. We 

have engaged global professional 

hotel 

management 

companies 

reputed for their experience and 

approach toward sustainability so as 

to tap into their valuable knowledge 

to help us in implementing and 

integrating sustainability in our daily 

business practices and operational 

activities. We aim to create a 

culture of sustainability among our 

staff in every aspect of our hotel 

operations, a culture which allows 

us to imprint positive influence on 

our guests through their experience 

with us.

4.1  Sustainability 

Management Framework

In July 2017, we took the initiative to 

establish our sustainability reporting 

framework. We 

performed 

an 

analysis on our business and 

operation models to establish the 

basis for our stakeholder mapping 

and 

materiality 

assessment. 

Through our analysis, we identified 

five key stakeholder groups within 

our sustainability context and their 

respective material issues are to be 

shown in this report.

4.2  Key Stakeholders and 

Material Issues

We have a review, assessment 

and feedback process in relation 

to ESG topics. The key to this 

is a risk assessment exercise 

which entails the identification, 

assessment and documentation of 

material risks and corresponding 

internal controls. Such material 

risks include fraud and corruption, 

environmental, health and safety, 

and human capital risks. We review 

the adequacy and effectiveness 

of our risk assessment process in 

response to changing business and 

operation environment.

We identify and review material 

issues that are most relevant 

and significant to us and our 

stakeholders. Priority is given to 

issues important to society that is 

applicable to us. We then prioritise 

our sustainability efforts and report 

issues that are most material to our 

business and stakeholders.

Corporate Social Responsibility 

is a key driver towards long-

term 

sustainability 

which 

is 

pragmatically 

integrated 

into 

our business practices as one of 

the core values in our corporate 

culture.

Significance

Environment and Future 

Generation

	Climate change

	Natural disaster

	Urbanisation, pollution etc.

Our core business is in the area of hospitality. 

Our hotels provide comfortable and conducive 

accommodation to our customers. Climate change 

such as prolonged winter or monsoon seasons and 

pollution directly affect the holiday or business-

related experience of our customers.

Our sustainability agenda for the environment and 

future generation has evolved over many years 

and is central to our business operations as well 

as being instilled into the day-to-day work practices 

of our staff. Our measures focus on the key goals 

of reduction of energy and water consumption, 

reduction of carbon footprint, and raising staff 

awareness of sustainable issues.

Employee

	Employee skill set

	Employee equal opportunity based 

on merit

	Non-discrimination

	Code of conduct

	Human rights

Our employees want to work in a company that 

is ethical and empathetic, where they will be 

motivated and empowered to meet their full 

potential, both professionally and personally.

Through mutual respect and equal opportunities 

based on merit, we develop a culture of goodwill 

and motivation with the employees. Such culture 

will translate into hospitality towards our hotel 

guests.

Customer

	Customer health and safety

	Terrorism

	Consumer trends

The safety and security of guests and clients are 

of paramount importance, particularly as the 

hotels are located in major cities (e.g. London) 

and tourist destinations (e.g. Phuket) which have 

witnessed several terrorism-related activities in the 

recent years. Fire, life and safety related standards 

are strictly adhered to, in compliance with legal 

regulations. Such measures instill guest confidence 

in the hotels and the brand.

Our service and product are continuously upgraded 

in line with consumer trends, allowing the hotels to 

be competitive in their respective markets.

Supplier

	Sustainable and quality supplies

	Ethical practice of suppliers

Working closely with suppliers and channel partners 

would boost competitiveness and encourage 

sharing of sustainable practices.

Community

	Preserving culture and heritage of 

the local community

	Goodwill with local community

Our hotels maintain good relationships with our 

neighbours in the cities and areas where they are 

located. Much care has been taken to maintain the 

façade of the hotels to blend in with the local built 

environment.

Management team members are involved in local 

associations which promote various community 

causes. Such measures help to build the hotels’ 

reputation in the local community.

Common to All 

Stakeholder Groups

	Compliance with prevailing laws 

and regulations.

	Respect local culture, 

stakeholders and norms within 

the laws and regulations.

Legal compliance and ethical actions form the core 

of our business, and our ethos is exemplified by 

strong corporate governance, transparent reporting 

and open communication with all our stakeholder 

groups.

Communication and provision of 

appropriate feedback mechanisms 

which will allow us to monitor and 

evaluate performance as well as 

explore new possibilities is critical 

in sustainability reporting. This is 

managed through a CSR plan.

We 

believe 

that 

good 

CSR 

practice goes hand-in-hand with 

good 

corporate 

management 

practice. We also recognise that 

it is vital that our management 

approaches are adaptable to 

the dynamics of business and 

operation environment across 

geographic boundaries in such 

a way that we can continuously 

assess our impacts, develop 

sustainability 

objectives 

and 

respond in a proper manner to 

meet expectations.

5.1.1 Our Approach

We continuously seek new and 

innovative ways to reduce the 

environmental 

impact 

of 

our 

products 

and 

services 

while 

maintaining 

the 

quality. 

We 

recognise our responsibility to 

protect the environment for the 

health and wellbeing of future 

generations.

5.1.2 Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective 

management 

and 

monitoring 

of carbon footprint can reduce 

operating 

costs, 

raise 

brand 

profile, create a competitive edge 

and increase stakeholder value. 

Our carbon footprint is measured 

in terms of Greenhouse Gas 

(GHG) emissions. However, GHG 

emissions is an absolute measure 

of how much carbon dioxide 

equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our 

GHG emissions is predominantly 

indirect (Scope 2) emissions. We 

have direct (Scope 1) emissions 

and we do not include the GHG 

emissions 

generated 

by 

our 

suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering 

the 

changes 

and 

dynamics 

of 

business 

and 

operations, we established our 

GHG emission efficiency index 

for consistent tracking of carbon 

footprint over time. To this end, 

we have set a target for GHG 

emissions efficiency improvement 

of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030. 

Our target for GHG emissions 

improvement is 0.8% per year. Our 

GHG emission index for FY2017 

stands at 129,789.44 kgCO2e per 

SGD million.

5.1  Protecting Our Environment for Future Generations

FY2017 

is 

our 

first 

year 

of 

sustainability reporting and will be 

used as reference against which 

the performance will be measured 

in subsequent years.

Paper Consumption Index





5.1.3 Reduction of Paper 

Consumption

Our employees are urged to 

minimise paper wastage at work by 

adhering to our internal guidelines. 

For example, double-sided printing 

is set as a default, lower grammage 

paper is used for daily printing, 

and blank sides of unneeded 

single-sided copies are used for 

printing drafts. A green message 

to consider the environment before 

printing is always included in the 

email signatures of our employees. 

Paper re-use and recycling habits 

are 

also 

cultivated 

through 

initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the copy 

machines.

We have embarked on a digital 

document management system 

with an aim to improve operational 

efficiency, security and reduce 

paper consumption. We hope to 

eventually evolve into a paperless 

working environment.

Considering 

the 

changes 

and 

dynamics 

of 

business 

and 

operations, 

we 

established 

our 

paper 

consumption 

index 

for consistent tracking of paper 

consumption over time. To this end, 

we have set a target for a reduction 

in paper consumption of 10% from 

our 2017 level by 2030. Our target 

for reduction of paper consumption 

is 0.8% per year. 

In FY2017, we consumed a total 

of 7,671.51 kg of paper, 100% of 

which 

are 

Forest 

Stewardship 

Council (FSC) certified. Our paper 

consumption 

index 

stands 

at 

159.91 kg per SGD million.

FY2017 

is 

our 

first 

year 

of 

sustainability reporting and will be 

used as reference against which 

the performance will be measured 

in subsequent years.

Examples of green solutions range 

from using energy-efficient lighting 

and lighting controls, installing 

water-efficient bathroom fixtures 

to using energy efficient appliances 

or any other alternative energy 

sourcing.

5.1.5 Hotel Sustainability Initiatives

Our 

hotels 

proactively 

track 

sustainability indicators as a core 

part of our hotel management 

practices. Some key indicators are 

shown in section 6.3.

5.1.4 Promoting Green Practices

Our operations in various locations 

are in the various stage of their 

journey in the implementation of 

green solutions suitable for their 

respective operating environments. 

Green 

solutions 

are 

initiatives 

that our hotels can implement 

to 

progressively 

improve 

their 

operation practices toward their 

respective sustainability goals. Each 

green solution lays out the steps that 

the hotel must take to implement 

the 

solution. 

Such 

initiatives 

are to be implemented through 

areas such as design, operational 

procedures and adaptation of green 

technologies to achieve objectives 

such as reducing energy, water and 

waste, cutting carbon emissions, 

improving guest health and comfort 

as well as reducing operating and 

maintenance costs.

5.2.1 Our Approach

Our 

people 

are 

our 

valuable 

resource and investing in their 

professional development is vital 

to our business sustainability. Our 

goal is to establish work ethics 

among our employees, which are in 

line with our core values and code 

of conduct. 

We recognise that a motivated 

workforce will convey a positive 

message to our key stakeholders. By 

attracting, nurturing, empowering 

and rewarding our employees, we 

create an environment conducive for 

innovation and inspiration which 

will boost our competitiveness.

Our 

business 

operates 

in 

an 

environment with diverse races, 

cultures and geographic locations. 

With this in mind, our HR polices 

take 

into 

consideration 

the 

prevailing laws and regulations as 

well as local culture, norms and 

sensitivity.

5.2.2 Employment Practices

Our 

Human 

Resource 

(HR) 

management 

principles 

and 

policies have 

been 

developed 

and established based on fair 

employment practices with the 

goal of attracting, developing and 

retaining a robust and motivated 

workforce. Our HR policies cover 

key areas such as remuneration, 

benefits, 

and 

training. 

Our 

performance-based reward scheme 

provides guidance and motivation 

to our employees to perform to 

their potential in alignment with the 

objectives of the Group.

5.2.2.1 Communication

As 

we 

grow, 

effective 

communication 

across 

the 

organisation is crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives 

between the employees and the 

organisation. 

We 

achieve 

this 

through our various communication 

sessions customised based on the 

target employees. Communication 

sessions for our managers are held 

on a regular basis. The agendas 

covered at these sessions are 

customised as appropriate to the 

target functional scope of the 

managers. 

5.2.2.2 Employee Feedback

We value our employees’ expertise 

in their areas of responsibilities. 

Therefore, 

their 

feedback 

is 

important in the improvement of 

overall management and operations 

of the organisation. Through various 

established processes of employee 

engagement, such as employee 

objective 

setting, 

performance 

review as well as exit interviews in 

events of resignations, we gather 

valuable feedbacks for continuous 

improvements to the organisation.

In 

addition, 

there 

are 

other 

feedback 

channels

5.2.6 Individual Rights

Protecting basic human rights is 

fundamental to all our operations, 

Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination 

and 

harassment, 

protection of privacy, prohibition 

of forced and child labour, and 

workplace 

health 

and 

safety 

are observed within the work 

environment. Discrimination and 

harassment is not tolerated.

We also respect our employees’ 

rights to freedom of association 

as well as their membership with 

trade unions and other professional 

bodies.

In FY2017, some of our workforce 

was 

covered 

by 

a 

collective 

bargaining agreement; no incidents 

of forced labour, child labour or 

young workers were identified 

across the organisation, and no 

human rights-related grievances 

have been reported.

In addition to the human resources 

we manage, we also engage 

external 

contracted 

companies 

as our outsourced vendors to 

provide personnel, who might work 

within our premises. Although we 

supervise these people, they are 

employed by contracted companies 

and are not included in our head 

count. We do not employ other 

types of un-contracted workers.

We expect that the contracted 

companies we work with will 

share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In the 

event that this expectation is 

compromised, we will determine 

if we will continue to engage them.

5.2.4 Employee Benefits

Employees 

are 

provided 

basic 

employment terms and working 

conditions 

including 

contract 

requirements, 

remuneration, 

hours of work, overtime, rest 

days and annual leave entitlement. 

In addition, we provide beyond-

compliance-level benefits to our 

full-time employees.

5.2.4.1 Retirement and Healthcare

Our 

Group 

has 

presence 

in 

various 

geographic 

locations 

where there are various local laws 

and regulations on pension and 

healthcare for employees. Our HR 

management practices comply with 

applicable laws and regulations in 

the countries we operate in.

5.2.5 Safety and Health in the 

Workplace

We are committed to workplace 

safety 

and 

health 

and 

take 

precautions to prevent occupational 

injuries among employees. We 

believe that safe work conditions 

will boost morale.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

5.3.1 Our Approach

Safety within our hotel premises 

have always been our key priority.

Open and frequent communication 

and 

responsive 

feedback 

are 

ingrained into our daily activities 

with 

customer 

interaction. 

In 

addition to striving for excellence 

in our product, service and support, 

we attach importance to data 

privacy. We have processes and 

controls in place over confidential 

and sensitive data related to our 

customers.

5.3.2 Health and Safety

Providing 

an 

accommodating 

atmosphere 

that 

does 

not 

compromise safety is the biggest 

challenge that hotels face. Achieving 

these goals require a multifaceted 

plan that starts with staff training 

and guest education about safety 

and security issues. Our hotel 

management consistently enforce 

established 

security 

policies, 

such as allowing only registered 

guests on hotel property. Constant 

planning to stay ahead of these 

issues is also a must, especially 

when the hotel hosts public events.

5.3.2.1 Access Control

Controlling access is an important 

part of hotel security planning to 

prevent criminal activities such 

as theft from guest rooms. Our 

contractors and staff are trained 

in controlling room key distribution 

and restricting access to registered 

guests 

only. 

During 

off-hours, 

security personnel are stationed 

at all main access points to greet 

people, while deterring anyone 

with no business from entering the 

property, especially disruptive or 

intoxicated non-guests.

5.3.2.2 Guests Education

Hotel 

employees 

have 

a 

responsibility to educate guests on 

safety and security responsibilities. 

The challenge for staff is to get the 

message across without negatively 

affecting the customer’s experience. 

For instance, the bellman can gently 

remind guests the importance 

of locking room doors to prevent 

theft when delivering luggage to 

guests’ rooms. Front desk staff can 

also subtly discourage guests from 

actions that leave them vulnerable 

to crime, such as flashing their room 

key cards with room numbers. Our 

staff are trained to manage such 

delicate situations in a professional 

manner to ensure the safety of our 

guests.

5.3.2.3 Public Areas Patrol

Technology has come a long way 

in helping hotels upgrade basic 

security measures. Closed-circuit 

TV cameras with recording systems 

are essential for securing such 

busy public spaces such as bars, 

lounges, parking lots, and loading 

bays. However, these areas also 

allow open access to disruptive 



persons, muggers and pickpockets. 

Monitoring of the camera images 

by staff and proper lighting reduces 

the opportunities for such crimes.

5.3.2.4 Staff Training

Hotel guests can participate in 

relevant safety programmes carried 

out by the hotels. Our hotel staff 

are trained with the aim of ensuring 

a consistent, professional response 

to emergencies. Our staff are 

empowered to take responsibility in 

addressing unusual behaviour that 

occurs on hotel property, without 

jeopardising their own safety.

5.3.3 Data Safety and Privacy

Ensuring 

safety 

and 

privacy 

of our customers’ data is of 

great priority to us. We handle 

and 

communicate 

sensitive 

and confidential information of 

our customers such as guest 

registration, home addresses and 

credit card information with due 

care to ensure our customers’ data 

are managed in accordance to the 

level of confidentiality. We observe 

local laws and internal regulations 

applicable to personal information 

protection.

5.3  Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs


19

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT



5

5.4.1 Our Approach

Our supply chain activities can be 

split into two broad categories: 

corporate supply chains and hotel 

supply chains. Our corporate supply 

chains cover procurement for our 

corporate offices. At the hotel level, 

supply chains cover procurement 

for items required for running 

a hotel and cover a wide range 

of items including food, linens, 

cleaning supplies and furniture. 

We believe that building strong 

relationships with our suppliers is 

essential in achieving sustainable 

business practices throughout our 

supply chains. We recognise that 

we are only at the beginning of this 

process and have to be pragmatic 

in terms of communication and 

expectation of our key suppliers. 

5.4.2 Supplier Selection

Our key suppliers are selected 

through 

our 

supplier 

selection 

process. When selecting our key 

suppliers, 

we 

examine 

criteria 

such as financial health, quality 

of products and services and 

competitiveness of pricing. Our final 

decision on supplier selection will 

be based on the overall assessment 

which takes a balanced view across 

all selection criteria.

5.4.3 Supplier Review

We review the performance of 

our key suppliers to determine 

whether to extend our partnership 

with them. Such review process 

allows us to evaluate and ensure 

that our key suppliers’ services and 

products aligns to our business 

requirements 

and 

sustainability 

objectives.

5.5  Supporting Our Community



5.5.1 Our Approach

We believe in giving back to the 

communities 

we 

conduct 

our 

business in. Over the years, we 

have been providing support to 

local schools, families with financial 

difficulties and disaster relief efforts. 

To this end, our engagement 

programmes encompass financial 

and practical support to carefully 

selected beneficiaries, such as 

fundraising and voluntary activities 

like 

donations 

of 

cash 

and 

necessities.

These out-reach efforts year on year 

have fostered goodwill, improved 

relations and communication, and 

helped to nurture a stable and 

peaceful local environment. 

Our 

community 

initiatives 

are 

planned and chosen according to 

how closely they align with our 

own community engagement goals, 

the anticipated staff participation 

rate, and the tangible impact on the 

beneficiary.

Performance

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions 

from 

fuel

consumptions 

are 

measured 

in GHG emissions in kgCO2e 

while electricity consumption is 

measured in kilowatt hour (kWh). 

We purchased fuel and electricity 

from non-renewable sources.

Our business and function grow over 

time and the GHG emissions and 

electricity consumption  patterns 

vary. To ensure consistency and 

comparability of the GHG emissions 

and 

electricity 

consumption 

measures over time, we create a 

GHG emission index and electricity 

consumption 

index 

for 

our

of our activities. We normalise the 

amount of GHG emissions and

amount of our revenues which 

we use as a proxy of the size of 

our activities. The GHG emission 

index is measured in kgCO2e per

We capture the data for paper 

consumption by the number of 

reams used, where one ream 

is equivalent to 500 sheets of 

paper. To ensure consistency and 

comparability across various paper 

sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, 

we measure paper consumption by 

the weight of paper used which is 

adjusted for the various sizes and 

quality of papers.

Our 

business 

and 

function 

grow over time and the paper 

consumption patterns vary. We 

devise a paper consumption index 

for our performance monitoring. 

The 

index 

adjusts 

the 

paper 

consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalise the  weight 

of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as 

a proxy of the size of our activities. 

The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per SGD
