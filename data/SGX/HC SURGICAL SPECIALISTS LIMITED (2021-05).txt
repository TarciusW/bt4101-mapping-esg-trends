BOARD STATEMENT - MESSAGE FROM THE 

CHAIRMAN 

Dear Stakeholders, 

We are in our fourth year of the sustainability reporting journey, and on behalf of the Directors and 

Management of HC Surgical Specialists Limited (“HCSS”) and our subsidiaries (collectively, the 

“Group”), I am pleased to present the Sustainability Report (the “Report”) of the Group for the 

financial year ended 31 May 2021 (“FY2021”). This Report outlines our continuous commitment 

towards operating our businesses in an economically, socially and environmentally responsible 

manner. 

The Group recognises that it is critically important to ensure that our business contains sustainable 

development and practices. While in recent years, there have been increased challenges in coping and 

adapting to economic and environmental changes, we strive to fulfil our sustainability responsibilities 

by implementing a variety of initiatives and strengthening our sustainability strategies. We seek to use 

our sustainability report to present and detail our efforts in this space. 

One of the Board’s key objectives is and has been to ensure alignment between sustainability goals 

and our business activities. To achieve this, our key decision makers are instrumental in guiding and 

overseeing our Group’s sustainability efforts, while being responsible for the management and 

monitoring of material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. 

We are confident that HCSS will continue to flourish and with your support, we will continue our 

efforts to work towards a more sustainable business for our stakeholders.  

 

Mr. Chong Weng Hoe 

Non-Executive Chairman and Independent Director

DISCLOSURES DURING COVID-19 

The World Health Organisation declared the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak as a global 

pandemic on 11 March 2020. The effects of the pandemic, as well as the measures implemented 

locally and globally, have resulted in both economic and operational disruptions to the Group. The 

COVID-19 pandemic is now in its 2nd year and we are well-prepared with safety management measures 

in place, in compliance with the Singapore Government’s regulations. 

Office Staff 

In this time of uncertainty, the safety and well-being of our staff remain our priority. In accordance 

with the Singapore Government’s requirements, we have implemented safe distancing measures and 

telecommuting arrangements where possible. All of our employees are provided with face masks and 

hand sanitisers provided by HCSS. We are also sending regular updates to our employees on the 

prevailing COVID-19 measures as well as reminders on maintaining good personal hygiene during this 

time. 

Clinic’s Measures 

The Group is also cognizant of the need to keep our clinics safe for staff, patients and visitors. Safe 

distancing measures of 1-2 metres (depending on each clinic’s space) have been clearly demarcated. 

Our clinical staff are also all fully vaccinated. To reduce overcrowding, there is also a current limit of 

one accompanying person with each patient. We also ensure that shields are set-up at counters as a 

segregation measure to further protect our staff.  Patients visiting our clinics are encouraged to use 

hand sanitisers provided in the clinic, to uphold good personal hygiene practices and reduce the 

transmission of the virus.  

Other business measures 

The Group has also reviewed its supply chain to ensure that we have minimum disruption in the event 

of a global or local shortage of medical equipment and supplies. The global disruption on economy 

and business operations fortunately has had minimal effect on our supply chain, as we rely mostly on 

local suppliers. In fact, our businesses have flourished due to the pent-up demand when the circuit 

breaker measures were lifted on 2 June 2020, and our profitability has improved in the past financial 

year. 

The President’s Challenge and The Courage Fund for frontline workers and community volunteers  

In FY2021, as part of our corporate social responsibility initiative, the Group held a charity event on 

19 July 2020, to provide endoscopic services at our endoscopy centres. In accordance with the Ministry 

of Health of Singapore (“MOH”) guidelines, we successfully implemented the event with safe 

management measures in place. Net proceeds raised from endoscopy procedures performed during 

the HCSS event amounted to S$36,700. In addition, HCSS matched the amount raised during the event 

dollar for dollar. In total, S$73,400 was donated to The Courage Fund and the President’s Challenge.  

President's Challenge was established in 2000 by the late Mr. S. R. Nathan, the sixth President of the 

Republic of Singapore, to raise funds for the social service sector and reach out to needy children, 

families, seniors, disabled and other social service endeavours. The Courage Fund, established in 2003 

when Singapore was hit by SARS outbreak, has provided relief for dependents of individuals who have 

succumbed to the virus, frontline workers and community volunteers who have contracted COVID-19 

in the line of duty and lower-income households affected by COVID-19.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Corporate Governance and Sustainability Approach 

In accordance with the guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 issued by the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore (the "MAS"), the Group adheres to its principles and practices in respect of 

corporate governance, and we strive to create long-term value for our stakeholders by taking a holistic 

approach.   

To demonstrate accountability to our stakeholders and effectively implement our sustainability 

approach, HCSS employees strictly adhere to the Code of Conduct set out in the Employee’s 

Handbook, Conflict of Interest Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and Data Protection Policy. The purposes 

and objectives of the policies are summarised as follows:  

Code of Conduct 

 

The Group’s Code of Conduct serves as a central guide and reference to 

employees in ensuring that they have clear understanding of the 

expectations, and are assured of HCSS’ guiding principles for workplace 

behaviour. The Code of Conduct promotes a healthy and safe working 

environment for every individual, and also provides our employees clarity 

regarding HCSS’ leadership’s expectations that an employee can easily and 

regularly refer to, so that he/she can act with confidence and consistency. 

 

Conflicts of Interest Policy 

 

HCSS has established policies and procedures to ensure that our employees 

understand the circumstances under which his or her personal interest may 

conflict with that of the Group. All employees of the Group involved in the 

i) purchase of goods and services, ii) selection of suppliers of goods or 

services, iii) selection of third party partners/relationships with the 

Company, are required to declare and disclose any situation where their 

private businesses or personal interests conflict with those of the Group, or 

situations when they (or a close family member) have a direct or indirect 

personal relationship, affiliation or association with an existing or 

prospective supplier or patient of the Group.  

 

Whistleblowing Policy 

 

The Group has established and adopted a whistleblowing policy since 2016 

to provide an avenue for employees and external parties to raise concerns. 

Our whistleblowing channels are designed to protect anonymity and our 

policy also contains a strict non-retaliation clause for reports made in good 

faith. The Whistleblowing Policy has been aligned to the guidance set out 

in the Code of Conduct which encourages employees to raise concerns, in 

confidence, about possible irregularities. The detailed whistleblowing 

policy 

is 

available

our 

website

Protection Policy, which is drafted in alignment with the Singapore Personal 

Data Protection Act (“PDPA”), its amendments and other relevant

Stakeholders and Material Topics

our sustainability approach with their needs and expectations through an open two-way 

communication.  

The information below illustrates key stakeholder groups and the engagement activities.

staff meetings. We aim to maintain a safe and fair working environment for 

them together with opportunities of career progression and self-development. 

 

 

Patients 

 

We engage our patients through direct feedback during consultations. We aim 

to give them better healthcare services with greater ease and convenience.

through emails. We constantly communicate with them to ensure quality and 

efficiency.

general meetings, our corporate announcements or emails. We aim to develop 

business growth and strategy within the Group and deliver strong business

Materiality Assessment 

Our materiality asssessment is reviewed at a minimum on an annual basis based on feedback from 

stakeholders and is aligned to our business goals.  

In response to feedback received from our internal and external stakeholders, we have re-evaluated 

and identified relevant material topics that would have significant ESG impact and are relevant to our 

organisation and stakeholders.  

In our discussions on the relevant material issues for FY2021, the senior management has taken into 

account the prevailing economic environment, the performance of our sustainability efforts and also 

the opinions of our various stakeholder groups. Based on the assessment, the material topics for the 

Group for FY2021 remained the same as those disclosed in the prior financial year, and are listed

SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

 

Economic Performance 

 





















































































 

Why is it Material? 

At HCSS, we believe that long-term economic success benefits all of our stakeholders, not just our 

investors. HCSS seeks to achieve this economic success hand-in-hand with sustainable processes and 

we aim to distribute economic benefits directly or indirectly to our stakeholders. Apart from dividends 

to shareholders, our economic benefits were distributed to the government through taxes, to 

employees through salaries and wages, and to society through job creation and the ability to provide 

free consultation as a socially responsible organisation. 

 

Management Approach 

Acquiring general practitioner (“GP”) clinics continues to be part of the Group’s expansion plans in 

FY2021 to secure a stable stream of patients. With the continual acquisition of GP clinics, we are able 

to offer a wider range of services, while also identifying and grooming young talented specialists. We 

are on a steady pace to further expand our presence in Singapore’s heartlands, to enhance our current 

offerings to deliver timely, safe, accurate and efficient services to our patients. For this financial year, 

HCSS has: 

- 

Completed its acquisition of a 51% stake in GMH Endoscopy &amp; Surgery Pte. Ltd.  

We completed the acquisition of 51.0% of the total issued and paid-up share capital in GMH 

Endoscopy &amp; Surgery Pte. Ltd. (“GMHES”) on 16 June 2020, where GMHES became a 

subsidiary of the Company. All things considered, this acquisition allows us to further build on 

our existing capabilities and offerings. 

 

- 

Opened an endoscopy centre within the Toa Payoh area  

We expanded and incorporated a sole proprietorship in Singapore, known as HC Endoscopy 

&amp; Piles Centre (TPY) for the provision of medical services on 8 September 2020. The clinic, 

which is owned by our subsidiary HCTPY, is located in Toa Payoh Town Centre and is directly 

linked to Toa Payoh MRT station and bus interchange, with its neighbourhood comprising 

mainly HDB shops and commercial developments and HDB residential flats. HCSS believes that 

by establishing our presence in Toa Payoh, we will be providing a wider range of services 

across the heartland areas of Singapore, which then allows us to serve our local population 

and boost our presence in the heartlands as it is located at a prime location. 

 

- 

Acquired equity interest in Healthcare Essentials Pte. Ltd. 

As part of our diversification strategy, HCSS also acquired a 20% equity interest in Healthcare 

Essentials Pte. Ltd. on 23 December 2020.

Economic Performance (cont’d) 

 





















































































 

The Group works closely with established insurance companies and corporations to ensure our 

services performed for patients are competitive, and to bring our specialists closer to the patients who 

require our services. With effect from 8 October 2020, HCSS was appointed by Prudential Assurance 

Company Singapore (Pte) Limited to provide high quality and cost-efficient health services for their 

eligible customers. With this appointment, we foresee a consistent stream of revenue for our 

specialists and an additional source of patient referrals.  

 

In FY2021, the Group saw a increase in revenue of approximately 39.7% in comparison with the 

financial year ended 31 May 2020 (“FY2020”) due to heightened demand for the Group’s medical 

services after the circuit breaker measures were lifted on 2 June 2020.  

For the specific breakdown of our economic performance in FY2021, please refer to relevant sections 

of our Annual Report 2021, published on our website at www.hcsurgicalspecialists.com. 

The Singapore Government had introduced the Job Support Scheme (“JSS”) to alleviate financial 

constraints faced by companies due to the on-going pandemic situation. In FY2021, a total of 

S$358,000 has been recognised in the Group’s financial statement, while the Group has received total 

actual grant payout of S$362,000 in July 2020, October 2020 and March 2021. JSS grant is recognised 

in the Group’s financial statements on a systematic basis over the periods in which the salary expenses 

are recognised in the financial statements.

The Group will continue to look out for business expansion opportunities and maintain its 

commitment to quality and cost-effective medical services. With this strategy, we hope to generate 

sustainable economic value to our stakeholders, while also striving to be a high quality medical 

services provider in Singapore. To create long-term value for our shareholders, we will continue to 

strive to engage in more strategic partnerships and collaborations.

Effluents and Waste 

 





















































































 

Why is it Material? 

In the running of our business operations, we inevitably generate effluents and waste. We recognise 

that the generation and improper disposal of this waste inevitably produces effects which are 

damaging to the environment and are a contributor to climate change. Hence, HCSS is committed in 

ensuring that proper waste management and disposal procedures are adhered to, to prevent potential 

health threats to our patients, the community and the environment. We aim to adhere to the 

standards of safety and hygiene in the disposal of medical and bio-hazardous waste set out by the 

relevant authorities.  

 

Management Approach 

Our business operations mainly generate two main groups of effluents and waste: sharps containers 

and liquid bio-waste. Our waste handling process includes safeguards such as: 

• 

disposing waste into their designated waste bins, which are sorted by categories;  

• 

appointing certified third-party contractors to transport the waste to a dedicated hospital 

waste incinerator;  

• 

conducting periodic assessments on our waste management vendors to ensure that our 

expectations are met; and 

• 

training our medical staff extensively on proper management and disposal of medical waste. 

In compliance with the relevant regulations, all medical staff are trained in identifying 

different types of medical waste to facilitate appropriate waste disposal. 

Mitigating the danger of improper disposal of medical waste is our priority. We fully understand the 

potential impacts of improper medical waste disposal on us, our community as well as the 

environment. Hence, it is important that our intiatives comply with the National Environment Agency’s 

and MOH’s rules and regulations.

LITRES OF CLINICAL WASTE INCINERATED BY CONTRACTORS 

 

In FY2021, HCSS has successfully reduced the amount of clinical waste disposed from 6,429.26 litres 

to 3,129.78 litres, a decrease of approximately 51.3% in waste generated in comparison with FY2020. 

The diagram represents the comparison of clinical waste generated in FY2021 and FY2020, as well as 

the third party contractors involved in the clinical waste incineration process. The significant decrease 

in clinical waste in FY2021 is due to higher number of cases performed in our principal doctors' clinics 

in hospitals which have their own disposal waste centre, thereby reducing our need to engage external 

vendors to dispose of biohazards. 

At HCSS, we continue to uphold the record of zero reported incidents of non-compliance with 

environmental regulations in FY2021.  

Targets 

In the coming financial year ending 31 May 2022 (“FY2022”), we are confident in our ability to continue 

our full compliance with environmental regulations regarding clinical waste. We will continue to 

monitor our medical waste disposal processes and seek out opportunities to integrate sustainable 

measures in our clinical waste disposal.

Employment 

 





















































































 

Why is it Material? 

Employees are the key to our continued and sustainable success in the medical industry. HCSS' success 

has always been attributed to its talented, dedicated and professional employees. As our most 

valuable asset, we strongly believe in continually investing in our employees. The Board of Directors 

and senior management see that the quality of service HCSS provides is tied to having a diversified 

workforce with long-term service employees. 

Management Approach 

At HCSS, we are committed to attract, retain, and develop exceptional talent. In turn, this will greatly 

affect the Group's development. We have policies and practices in place to protect the rights of our 

employees, allowing equal and fair opportunities to all. Recruitment and selection policies, flexible 

working policies, maternity policies, and grievance procedures are established, formalised, and strictly 

enforced. Our employees' suggestions are valued, and we strive to have periodic reviews and 

communication sessions with them. As part of HCSS’s commitment to create a workplace based on 

trust and mutual respect, we have also established systems / channels for employees to provide 

feedback on how to improve our workplace. 

As part of our employee benefits package, we offer medical and dental coverage, as well as hospital 

insurance entitlements. In FY2021, due to the closure of borders, HCSS provided all our employees 

with the option to encash their unutilised annual leave as a gesture of appreciation in return for their 

hard work. Periodically, we also review the benefits given to all our employees, so that our 

compensation packages remain competitive.

Return to Work Rate and Retention Rate  

 

The reduction in ‘return to work’ rate in FY2021 was due to an employee who had resigned to remain 

at home to look after her child instead of returning to full-time work after her parental leave was fully 

utilised.  

Targets 

For FY2022, HCSS will continue to promote fair employment practices and keep a record zero of 

reported incidents relating to discrimination.

Patients’ Privacy 

 





















































































 

Why is it Material? 

With the rapid advances in technology, our patients are also increasingly concerned as to how their 

personal data is collected and used. Regulations are also being tightened in response to data breaches. 

It is vital that HCSS, as a healthcare provider holding client data, strengthens its security procedures 

to prevent the loss of patients’ data, and ensure that measures are implemented to handle data 

breach incidents, if any.  

Management Approach 

HCSS ensures that personal data is only collected, used, disclosed and processed for prescribed 

purposes with the patients' prior consent. Our Data Protection Policy includes procedures on 

responsible data handling, the use of data, and compliance monitoring. We have appointed a Data 

Protection Officer (“DPO”), and stakeholders who wish to contact our DPO can reach us at: 

contact@hcsurgicalspecialists.com. 

Each clinic adheres to strict data protection requirements, such as: 

• 

locking cabinets for restricted access to patient information; 

• 

assigning unique user IDs for IT applications to individual staff members; and  

• 

installing firewalls and antivirus softwares on all computers to ensure confidentiality and 

maintain patients’ privacy. 

With the above measures, patients’ data is therefore less vulnerable to unauthorised access, 

collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal.  

Performance 

For FY2021, we are pleased to report that there have been no reported incidents of loss of patients’ 

data, theft, or leakage. Additionally, there have been no complaints received regarding patients’ 

privacy. 

Targets 

As we move into FY2022, we aim to uphold our commitment to safeguarding our patients’ privacy at 

all times and to continue achieving zero complaints and no breaches of the Personal Data Protection 

Act.
