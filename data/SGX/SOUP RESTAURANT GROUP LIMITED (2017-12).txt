Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement is important for our success. We seek to better understand the material issues that affect 

our stakeholders, and focus on creating sustainable value for them. We have identified our key stakeholders and

engage them in a variety of formal and informal ways through the following channels:

We 

encourage 

customers 

to 

provide 

their 

feedback, primarily through emails to our sales and 

services team. Email feedback is circulated to the 

Management team, including the Executive Directors. 

Customer satisfaction is important to us and the 

feedback collected enables our Group to improve

our services, operations and business.

Executive 

Directors 

and 

senior 

management 

personnel visit our restaurants and central kitchens 

regularly to discuss the work schedule, progress and 

to understand first-hand the working conditions of 

our employees. During these sessions, Management 

is able to communicate with employees directly and 

share the business goals and values of the Group.    

Employees are encouraged to express their views 

and provide insights and information. Direct 

communication with our staff aligns the employees 

with our organisation's goals and values, and they 

are motivated to contribute to organisational 

success, with an enhanced sense of their own 

well-being. Other channels used include emails, 

regular meetings and annual staff evaluation 

sessions.

We work closely with various charity organisations 

and voluntary welfare homes to provide nutritious 

meals to their beneficiaries. We leverage on our 

core competency in the food and beverage sector 

to do good for the community. We also facilitate 

employment for the under-served segments in our 

community, such as ex-convicts and persons with 

disabilities.  We strive to create an ecosystem for 

doing good as we believe this promotes sustainable

positive vibes in the community.  

We announce quarterly and full year results and any 

material and price-sensitive information to the

public via SGXNET on a timely basis. 

Shareholders are encouraged to participate at 

annual general meetings to communicate their 

views on various matters affecting the Company.

We maintain a good relationship with our suppliers and 

work closely with them. The positive relationship 

ensures the quality of products or services delivered to 

our Group. Suppliers are assessed and evaluated in 

terms of pricing, quality, delivery reliability and service 

performance. Feedback on any quality issues arising is 

communicated to suppliers immediately to ensure

transparency.

We regularly attend training sessions and seminars 

organised by regulators, auditors and consultants 

to raise awareness of changes in laws and 

regulations that impact our business and to ensure

compliance with them.

FOOD SAFETY AND HYGIENE

SOCIAL

As a food and beverage group principally engaged in the 

restaurant business and central kitchen food processing, 

there is absolutely no room for any compromise in food 

safety. The health and safety of our customers is our top 

priority and we are committed to produce and serve safe 

and clean quality food with high standards of food safety 

best practices that conform to all regulatory requirements. 

THE GROUP HAS ESTABLISHED A SET OF 

STANDARD 

OPERATING 

PROCEDURES 

(“SOPS”) TO GOVERN AND MONITOR THE 

FOOD PREPARATION AND FOOD-HANDLING

PROCESSES IN DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. 

To uphold our high standards of food safety and 

quality, we have an in-house audit team to conduct 

regular Branch Quality Checks to ensure strict 

compliance with our SOPs.  In addition, our central 

kitchens have implemented a manual for the Hazard 

Analysis Critical Control Point (“HACCP”), a globally 

recognised system used to identify, reduce and 

eliminate potential food safety hazards. We also engage 

a third party laboratory to perform periodic testing of

food products to ensure food safety and quality. 

The Group will ensure all staff handling food at the outlets 

and the central kitchens attend courses on food and 

beverage safety and hygiene and will schedule refresher 

courses for existing staff from time to time. As at 31 

December 2017, we have 15 (2016:14) certified food 

hygiene officers and will continue to train and promote

more employees to qualify as food hygiene officers. 

Our centralised procurement team sources from responsible 

suppliers. They select, monitor and assess suppliers 

according to the Group’s SOPs, which include carrying 

out interviews, periodic performance reviews, sample 

tests and visits to suppliers’ storage locations.  The Group 

does not compromise on the quality of food ingredients

used in our restaurant outlets and central kitchens. 

Notwithstanding our best efforts, there were two incidents 

of non-compliance with regulations resulting in fines and 

warnings issued by the National Environment Agency 

(“NEA”).  We have undertaken corrective actions and 

reinforced our internal processes and practices to ensure

compliance with regulations.

A training module is integrated into our Human Resource 

Management System to record the training courses and 

hours provided to all eligible employees as well as the

feedback gathered for the training provided. 

In FY2017, the Company awarded 380 (2016 : 190) 

Statements of Attainment and 27 (2016 : None) 

Certificates in F &amp; B Operations to our staff.

Such qualifications are recognised nationwide. 

While focusing on employee retention through the 

development of clear career pathways for existing staff, 

the Group also intends to attract new and talented 

employees to learn and grow with the Group. We have 

enrolled in the Professional Conversion Programme and 

Earn and Learn Programme, both initiated by WSG and 

Skills Future. In FY2017, we have 5 candidates 

employed under these two schemes. The average 

training hours per employee per year is approximately 

26 hours. 

We strongly believe in providing a safe and healthy 

environment for all our employees.  We are committed to

achieving this through the following steps:

In FY2017 and FY2016, there were no workplace injuries

resulting in a fatality or permanent  injury.

Inculcate an “everybody plays a part to create a safe 

and healthy working environment” mind-set to all staff 

through 

orientation 

programmes 

and 

training 

sessions.   Staff are also given a workplace safety and

health handbook for easy reference. 

Create awareness of workplace safety issues by 

sharing workplace accident cases through regular

newsletters and team-sharing sessions.  

All outlets are provided with a Risk Management File 

with risk assessment questionnaires on respective

critical areas.

Enhance safety measures by installing the following

in all our kitchens:

a) Automatic Trip System - to ensure electrical

 

system shut down once there is a gas leak.

b) Gas Leak Detector - to shut down the gas inflow 

 

once a leak is detected.

c) Exhaust Control System – to shut down the gas

 

inflow if the exhaust system malfunctions.
