INNOVATE

An expression of Food Empire’s 

focus on innovation: Café Ket

Innovation is Food Empire’s key 

strategy 

towards 

strengthening 

our economic resilience. Every year, 

we closely monitor changes in our 

markets and think about innovative 

ways to ensure that we remain ahead 

of the curve. 

Vietnam accounts for the bulk of 

Food Empire’s Indochina sales. The 

introduction of Café PHO in 2013 in 

the country has successfully boosted 

Food Empire’s sales in the region. In 

the instant beverage sales category, 

Café PHO managed to reach an all-

time high sales revenue of USD 41.2 

million which represents more than 

five-fold in sales revenue compared 

to when it first relaunched in 2014. 

Today, Café PHO is ranked among in 

the top 5  instant coffee players in the 

3-in-1 segment in Vietnam. After our

Cappuccino di Torino

Cappuccino is one of the most widely 

consumed beverages in Russia. As 

a popular beverage in the country, 

locals have long been relishing and 

consuming cappuccino after each 

meal of the day, as a snack, or even 

as a dessert. 

success with Café PHO in Vietnam, 

it has been selling into Canada, 

Uzbekistan and in Azerbaijan.

In an effort to gain more market 

share in a rich coffee-drinking culture 

in Vietnam, Food Empire launched a 

new product: Café Ket in 2018. Café 

Ket came from a thorough study 

to evaluate the opportunity in the 

instant 

coffee 

market 

combined 

with the defined product positioning 

and exciting marketing campaign. 

Food Empire launched a marketing 

campaign for Café Ket in the first half 

of 2018, which include nation-wide 

sampling promotions and roadshow 

in Ho Chi Minh City, in addition to

Food Empire is highly aware of the 

cappuccino market potential and is 

eager to capture a larger customer 

base. We are confident that our 

experience in the traditional and 

popular cappuccino market could 

propel us to excel in capturing 

higher-end consumer base requiring 

a more premium and sophisticated 

product. Through a series and round 

of product testing both internally and 

externally, we have crafted a well-

made and well-received premium 

product, MacCoffee Cappuccino di 

Torino. 

Launched in Russia, December 2017, 

our MacCoffee Cappuccino di Torino 

has been greatly welcomed by the 

market. Our initial marketing efforts 

were fully focused on expanding and 

driving consumer survey. We offered 

thousands of free cappuccino cups 

in our key outlets to raise market 

awareness 

and 

the 

product’s 

popularity. We also roll out modern 

marketing 

campaigns 

through 

internet marketing project to attract 

a younger audience. We engaged 

Chi Minh City to Quang Nai, while 

the roadshow took place in Ho Chi 

Minh City. Through these campaigns, 

Food Empire expects to reach 

approximately 9 million people in 

introducing the new brand. The 

case illustrated how Food Empire

viable offerings for our consumers.

our 

newly 

created 

MacCoffee 

Cappuccino di Torino. Such efforts 

have resulted in a total of more than 

25 million views on social media 

within the first year of the production. 

Our 

efforts 

and 

commitments 

toward growing the brands have 

paid off, with MacCoffee Cappuccino 

di Torino being named as a product 

that was the quickest to break into 

the market and win the trust of 

consumers. The success of our newly 

established cappuccino brand has 

paved the way for Food Empire to 

expand its target market outside of 

Russia. We are expecting to start 

production in Ukraine in the later 

part of 2019. Separately, we are 

also pushing for market entrance in 

Armenia, Georgia and Belorussia to 

replicate our success in the Russian 

market. In the new markets, we will 

strive to spark love from the first sip 

of MacCoffee Cappuccino di Torino.

WHY IS ANTI-CORRUPTION IMPORTANT TO FOOD EMPIRE? 

[GRI 103-1]

Corruption has the possibility of causing significant harm to the organisation and our stakeholders. This includes 

reputational damage as well as possible legal proceedings depending on the nature of the corruption incident. For 

society at large, corruption can also result in socioeconomic and environmental discrimination to vulnerable groups. 

As a responsible member of society, we are committed to taking all possible steps towards ensuring that no forms of 

corruption take place within the organisation.

THE RECIPE FOR SUSTAINING OUR EMPIRE 


THE RECIPE FOR 

BUILDING A STRONG BRAND 

Our people are at the centre of all Food Empire’s operation. Without the commitment and 

efforts of all our employees, we would not be able to enjoy the success that we have thus far. 

The group makes all efforts to value our employees through the continuous improvement 

of our human resources practice and creating a fair and conducive working environment.

WHY ARE EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IMPORTANT 

TO FOOD EMPIRE? 

[GRI 103-1]

Food Empire always strived to be an employer of choice. 

We believe that diversity within our workforce is a 

significant differentiator in our industry and do not base 

our hiring preferences on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, 

age, etc. It is our firm belief that diversity and inclusivity are 

two integral aspects of enhancing teamwork, confidence 

and performance. Further, we recognise the importance 

of having established human resources policies for our 

group. Sound policies will enable us to attract and retain 

the right talent which translates to a profound impact of 

the company’s performance.

PROFILE OF OUR WORKFORCE 2

[GRI 102-8]

In Singapore, Russia and Vietnam, we have a total strength 

of 1,889 employees in 2018 (2017: 1,702). The majority of 

our employees are full-time and permanent employees. 

Vietnam accounted for about 60% of the total workforces. 

100% of Vietnam employees are working on a full-time 

Our Employment Practices

basis and hired on a permanent contract. As a growing 

market, our workforce in Vietnam is dominated by sales 

and production employees to support business growth. 

In Russia, our manpower requirement is mainly for 

production. Due to manpower shortage, it is the industry 

practice for manufacturing companies to employ 

temporary workers. All our temporary workers are 

entitled to a full benefits package which is comparable to 

permanent workers such as free meals, official transport, 

payment of primary and periodic medical examination. 

Meanwhile, in Singapore, where the headquarter is 

located, most of the employees are working in a corporate 

support function. Comprising a total of 47 employees, 

all employees in Singapore are full-time permanent 

employees.

It has been observed that gender diversity remained 

quite stable over the past year, with females representing 

almost 41% of our workforce (2017: 41%). 

We believe that diversity within our workforce is a significant 

differentiator in our industry and do not base our hiring 

preferences on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, etc. It is 

our firm belief that diversity and inclusivity are two integral 

aspects of enhancing teamwork, confidence and performance.

2. Vietnam’s employee data is included in the 2017 statistics presented in this section for comparison 

purposes. The difference in figures with the 2017 Sustainability Report is attributed to the fact that our 

previous report scoped to only include our Singapore and Russia operations.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

[GRI 103-2] [103-3]

Policy

Creating an inclusive workplace where every employee has the same opportunity to grow 

in our diverse working environment is critical for our business. In line with this belief, we 

implemented various policies across our operations to ensure fair employment in the company. 

Our employment policies are covering wide-range of employment practices which includes 

recruitment, employment benefits and career developments among other practices. The table

Commitment

To effectively implement employment policies across our operations, we delegate the day-to-

day Human Resources (“HR”) operation to our local HR team. Our corporate HR in Singapore is 

accountable to set the group’s key policies and track the implementation of the said policies in 

our operations.  

At the operation level, the HR departments are responsible for adopting the group’s employment 

policies which are subsequently tailored to include specific employment provisions from 

applicable regulations in the country. The local HR team reports key resources statistic to group 

HR quarterly.

The existing structure ensures consistency in human resources practices across the group while 

still providing flexibility to adapt to different regulatory requirements at operating countries.

New Hires 

[GRI 401-1]

In this reporting period, Food Empire welcomed a total of 

1,071 new employees across our operations in Russia and 

Vietnam, as well as our headquarters in Singapore. In this 

reporting period, the Group’s new hire rate is 56.7%. 

Most of our new hires came from the operations in 

Vietnam, with around 860 personnel joined the company 

in 2018. A sizeable portion of our new hires in Vietnam is 

to replace the high turnover in the sales team due to the 

prevailing characteristic of sales job in the country. The 

profile of our new hires in Vietnam comprises relatively 

young males due to the demand for frequent travelling 

as part of the sales responsibility. The profile of our new 

hires in Singapore and Russia are largely comparable with 

last year.

employees’ aspirations.  

3. The number of turnover in Russia does not include temporary foreign workers that need to leave the 

companies to reapply for their permit as it does not accurately reflect the turnover. As explained under 

Profile of our workforce section, the company seeks to rehire those workers when their permits are 

successfully renewed. In 2018, we rehire 100% of them.

Employment Benefits

[GRI 401-2]

Over the years, the Group provided all necessary 

employment benefits and welfare to our dedicated 

employees. The range of benefits covers insurance and 

healthcare, annual paid leave, transport reimbursements, 

recreation activities, overtime and meal allowance and 

long service awards.

Our benefit schedules comply with local laws and 

regulations where applicable. For example, in Vietnam, 

we comply with Internal Labour Regulations which was 

set based on Labour Code of 2012 regarding minimum 

annual leave, working hours, types and formats on leave 

of absence. 

TEAM BUILDING EVENT - VIETNAM

Food empire’s operations in Vietnam span across 

the country, from our operations in Delta Mekong 

area, the main office in Ho Chi Minh City and to our 

operations in the north of the country. We are aware 

of the importance of building a strong team morale 

to deliver solid performance in our business. In 2018, 

we arranged a team building session in Nha Trang, 

Vietnam, with more than 200 staffs participating in 

the event.

Through the event with the theme of “ONE FES 

TOGETHER WE WIN”, we aim to improve productivity, 

increase motivation, and collaboration among our 

staffs. The exercises have been tailored to nurture a 

successful company culture by cultivating team-work, 

increasing employees’ confidence and improving 

communication among others. 

NEW YEAR CELEBRATION – RUSSIA

The new year marks an important milestone for Food 

Empire and it serves as a new starting line for the 

business to set its journey. In Russia, we celebrated this 

by organising a corporate event for our employees to 

get together in a more informal setting as compared 

to their daily interaction in the office. Through this 

event, we aim to bring the team closer together, boost 

the employees’ morale and kickstart a brand new year.

DURIAN PARTY - SINGAPORE

Our corporate office in Singapore gathered together 

at a casual event with a feast of durians and other 

seasonal fruits. This was held to cultivate a sense 

of togetherness and serve as an opportunity to

In Russia, we strive to align our health and safety 

practices with the relevant regulations in the country. The

in accordance with the Labour Code of the Russian 

Federation and other federal laws concerning workforce 

safety. Our LSMS also managed to obtain external

It provides specific guidance on the risk assessment 

process, safe work practices, incident reporting process 

and performance monitoring process. A safety committee 

has been established to supervise the implementation 

of the system. This committee is also responsible for 

establishing and maintaining safety and health initiatives 

and programmes at the operation. Regular workplace 

inspections are conducted by the committee, in which 

following each inspection, any areas for improvement will 

be highlighted and a follow-up action will be implemented 

promptly.

Creating a safe work environment can only be achieved 

when we equip our employees with the proper skills and 

knowledge for them to work safely. We have established

mandatory safety induction training for new-hires and 

various safety training on specific topics. Routine pre-

work briefings and ad-hoc safety briefing have also been 

implemented to support the implementation of our safety 

programmes.

Despite our best effort in maintaining a safe working 

environment in Russia, we encountered three work-

related incidents during this reporting period. Most 

of the incidents involved hand injuries and the other 

pertained to lifting safety. To prevent reoccurrences, 

follow-up investigations and root cause analyses have 

been conducted for these cases. Further, ad-hoc safety 

briefings for all operators have been conducted to share 

the lesson learned of the incidents and corrective actions 

have also been implemented in the operation. Aside from 

the incidents, there is no occupational related illness 

recorded in FY2018. 

Vietnam 

A robust management system is also established in 

Vietnam for health and safety risk management. A 

committee which comprises of cross-functional team 

oversees the implementation of SHE policy. A regular 

health and safety committee meeting is held to evaluate 

the implementation of the company’s safety performance 

and programmes.

Risk assessment process has also put in place to prevent 

any work-related incidents. Risk registers was developed 

and reviewed annually to ensure its relevance to the 

changes in operation. A training matrix is prepared to 

ensure all personnel are equipped with the necessary 

safety training to work safely. This matrix includes 

training for newcomers, accident management, and 

emergency response. To create a strong safety culture 

in the workforce, regular safety meetings are held in 

our factories. Each department is designed to have pre-

work briefings with a strong emphasis on safety before 

starting any works. Our safety department has also 

launched a “Create Safety Moment” which comprises 

of key programmes such as safety training, talks, and 

posters. Apart from the practices as mentioned above, 

our workers in Vietnam are also equipped with a SHE 

handbook which contains the summary of safety 

practices, incident reporting and first-aid.

Case Study

SAFEGUARDING OUR PEOPLE 

RUSSIA

To equip our employees with the necessary skills in an emergency 

situation, we have deployed emergency preparedness training in 

our operations in Russia. This training includes basic fire-fighting 

technique, first-aid training and emergency evacuation drills. These 

training mostly held in our manufacturing facilities where the 

risk of incidents is higher compared to the office building. As an 

employer, we are committed to create a safe working environment 

for all employees by continuously providing essential knowledge 

for them to work safely. 

VIETNAM

Create Safety Moment is a new safety programme implemented 

in Vietnam this year. This programme comprises of various 

training and interactive talks such as first-aid, fire-fighting and fire 

protection training as well as emergency and evacuation drills. 

Both in-house trainer and external trainer were involved in the 

programmes’ execution. The programmes are mostly targeting 

our factories’ workers due to the higher risk their work possessed, 

compared to our staffs in the office.

With the implementation of this programme, the management 

aims to promote a safety culture among the workers and to 

manifest the goal of zero work-related incidents in the operations.

to demonstrate its ability to 

control food safety hazards 

and ensure food safety.

A team comprises of management, human resources, 

business, maintenance, and production teams were 

established to oversee the implementation of our food 

safety and quality management system across the 

operations in Vietnam. This team meets on regular basis 

to track and review the company’s performance. Multiple 

trainings concerning food safety also provided to relevant 

personnel, including ISO certification training, GMP 

training, and hazard analysis and critical control points 

(HACCP) training.

Supplier audits are conducted annually to review the 

performance of our suppliers, including food safety 

and quality of raw material. In our manufacturing 

facilities, a high standard of food safety management 

system is implemented. A comprehensive assessment 

was performed to identify operational prerequisite 

programmes (“ORP”) and critical control point (“CCP”) in 

our key processing steps. Robust monitoring procedures 

are implemented in these ORPs and CCPs to maintain the 

highest standards of our products.

In 

Vietnam, 

we 

provided 

internal 

and 

external 

communication channels for our stakeholders to provide 

feedbacks for any issues with our products. A hotline and 

a social media fan page are among the available channels 

provided by the company. As a testament to our effort in 

managing the health and safety of our product, we have 

zero incidents of non-compliance with all applicable laws 

and regulations concerning consumer health and safety.

We encourage our consumers to safely dispose off our products and packaging 

to minimise the impacts on people and planet.





Disposal, reuse or recycling

We identify the chemical and physical profile of our raw materials at a 

microbiological level. We formulate new recipes based on these characteristics.





Development of  

product concept

We embrace innovation through rigorous R&amp;D efforts with different types of 

coffee, cream substitutes and other ingredients to achieve suitable health and 

nutrition levels





Research and development

We voluntarily seek independent certification of our products. They are also 

subject to periodic health and safety inspection controlled by an independent, 

certified laboratory.





Certification

We have in place rigorous controls to test each batch of finished products. 

A system of identification and traceability is established whereby samples are 

stored for every batch. Any complaints or lapses will be verified by testing these 

stored samples.

THE RECIPE FOR BUILDING A STRONG BRAND 


THE RECIPE FOR CREATING A 

SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

At Food Empire, our operations are susceptible to climate change impacts. Vietnam is 

currently standing at the top 5th on the climate risk index, being one of the ten most 

vulnerable countries to climate change. Russia is also seeing stronger climate change 

impacts in the form of extreme weathers. It is critical that Food Empire is engaged and do 

our part to combat climate change and contribute to a sustainable low carbon future.

WHY ARE ENERGY AND EMISSIONS IMPORTANT 

TO FOOD EMPIRE?  

[GRI 103-1]

Climate change affecting agriculture businesses is no 

longer a study based on theories or research. Concrete 

evidence has indicated that climate change affects 

agricultural production and businesses. The United States 

Environmental Protection Agency states that a higher 

CO2 level in vegetation has been scientifically proven 

to causing adverse impacts on plant’s yield.  Our food 

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 11

[GRI 103-2]

Policy

In an effort to manage our operations’ carbon footprint, Food Empire implemented various energy 

conservation initiatives at facility-level across our operations. We always strive to align our energy 

and emissions management with the various country-specific energy regulations and policies. 

Russia

In Russia, the “Federal Law on Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency” outlines the 

requirement to reduce the intensity of electricity, heat, water and gas consumption of companies. 

An “Action Plan to Phase-Out Incandescent Lamps in Russia and to Promote Demand for Energy 

Efficient Light Sources” were also approved by the Government. This action plan sets out the 

requirement for organisations to increase their adoption of energy efficient lighting.

Over the years, our manufacturing plant in Russia has allocated resources to manage our energy 

consumption and GHG emissions better. In 2018, we evenly distributed resources throughout our 

facilities, ranging from the installation of new ventilation systems and modernisation of production 

equipment to the replacement of fluorescent lamps with motion sensor LED bulbs.

Vietnam

Our operation in Vietnam contributes to the company’s energy efficiency efforts by installing 

LED lamps in their facilities and implementing bulk capacity production practices, installing 

additional machines in the same area to increase production capacity. This initiative resulted in 

lower electricity consumption compared to normal operation.

security is therefore at stake; climate change also affects 

coffee-growing areas which are crucial for Food Empire’s 

businesses. For our businesses to sustain years ahead, 

Food Empire is fully aware of the detrimental effects of 

climate change and remains committed to improving 

on our environmental practices. In addition, climate 

change also has profound impacts on our consumers; 

for example, limit consumption during adverse weather 

events and long-term change in consumption behaviours 

due to economic activities disruption. 

11. As the headquarter in Singapore is limited to corporate support function, energy and GHG emissions 

topic is deemed immaterial. Hence, the operation has been excluded for this topic.

Initiatives and Performance 

[GRI 302-1] [302-3] [305-1] [305-2] [305-4]

This year, we will continue to implement a phased approach in managing our environmental 

impacts. Our primary goal is to continuously improve our energy efficiency performance 

across our facilities.

Russia

In Russia, fuel consumption mostly includes diesel oil and 

gasoline used to operate company vehicles. Purchased 

electricity remains a significant portion of our energy 

consumption in the country. Due to a limitation in our 

current system, we are unable to separate the electricity 

consumption from production and non-production 

activities. The total energy consumption shown will 

account for all activities ranging from production and 

warehouses to energy usage within the offices. 

In 2018, we encountered an increase in both energy and 

GHG emissions intensity in Russia. The increment results 

from the operation of two new warehouses. Although the 

warehouses started its operations in late 2017, it is expected 

that the energy and emissions intensity is increased as 

these two warehouses are fully-operated during 2018. 

Previously, these warehouses were outsourced to third 

party; hence, their energy consumption were not included 

in our total consumption.

Vietnam

A significant portion of energy consumption in Vietnam 

was similarly contributed by the consumption of 

purchased electricity. Liquefied petroleum gases and 

diesel were also used to fuel forklifts and company’s 

vehicles. The total electricity consumption presented 

signifies all electricity usage for both production and non-

production activities in the facilities.

In 2018, our Vietnam operation encountered a significant 

increase in energy consumption which resulted in higher 

GHG emissions compared to the operation in 2017. This 

increase was primarily due to the massive leap of 39.4% 

increase in production quantity; hence, despite the rise in 

electricity consumption, the energy intensity decreased 

approximately 5.8% and GHG emissions intensity 

decreased 2% this year.
