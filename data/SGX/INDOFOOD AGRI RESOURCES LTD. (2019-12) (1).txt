OUR APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

WE ARE COMMITTED TO MEETING THE 

WORLD’S FOOD NEEDS IN A SUSTAINABLE 

AND TRACEABLE MANNER

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

Our approach to sustainability is supported by our Vision, Mission, Values,

Code and Policies that commit us to responsible business practices and the

highest standards of quality and conduct.

Our management approach and six programmes show how we manage the

risks and opportunities of our material topics. They translate into action in

the form of management systems and standard operational procedures

(SOPs), certifications, external engagement, internal collaboration, R&amp;D,

and training.

We use an SAP enterprise data and sustainability information system to

assess progress against targets. We continuously review and update our

approach to align with emerging topics and global developments.

Our Board oversees the management and monitoring of our material ESG

topics.

At our quarterly Board Meetings, senior leaders of our Sustainability Think

Tank, led by the CEO, report on sustainability performance, provide

updates on recent sustainability developments, and share decisions made

in response to these developments.

The

Sustainability

Think

Tank

comprises

Executive

Directors,

Chief

Operating Officers, the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) unit, the R&amp;D

team, and sustainability representatives from each business unit.
