Dear Stakeholders, 

The emergence of a highly infectious virus from the beginning of 2020, that rapidly spread, continues to 

evolve and is still causing an unprecedented impact globally. Covid-19 has brought about severe challenges-

devastating communities globally and setting back economies. Various manufacturing industries and SMEs 

were not spared from the extensive impact of the pandemic either. 

Different industries have been hit by the various degrees of impact. The unemployment rate has risen, 

and companies have begun to shut down. The global economy is facing severe challenges with the current 

gloomy economic outlook. The industries face wage cuts, high rates of unemployment, and an increase in 

operational costs due to scarcity of supplies attributed to the closure of many countries’ borders in efforts 

to manage the spread of the virus. 

FY2020 has truly been a year marked by reinvention, and resilience. 2020 has pushed us to achieve a 

complete paradigm shift  in our performance management, work practices, and our future workplace 

expectations. We would like to express our utmost gratitude and respect to everyone who is involved in 

the fight against this pandemic, in treating and controlling its spread around the world.

Since Mun Siong’s incorporation in 1969, our Group has always strived to provide value-added services to 

our customers. Our operating policy adheres to the fields of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-

corruption beliefs. We stand by the sustainability imperative and have made it our objective to establish 

the social values of safety, security, fairness and efficiency in our operations.

Every one of us will seek to contribute solutions to social, safety and environmental issues. We seek to 

create a positive influence through our corporate citizenship activities, community contributions as well as 

listening to the voices of the society and our stakeholders via dialogues during our annual general meeting 

and corporate announcements. 

These beliefs and contributions are especially essential for us to withhold and practice during the pandemic 

year where many business aspects are impacted and affected by  Covid-19.

Executive Chairlady

Materiality 

Through regular engagement with both our internal and external stakeholders, we gain better insight into 

critical issues that are of most concern to our stakeholders and identify any change in priorities. The inputs 

from our stakeholders provide us with greater clarity during our evaluation in determining emerging trends 

and what our material focus area should be. 

The Executive Committee’s Sustainability Committee reviews the impact of our activities on these material 

ESG factors. Through this assessment, sustainable strategies are formed to address the emerging concerns 

of our stakeholders.  

In FY2020, the aspects that   have   been identified as material issues and will be covered in this report are 

as follows:

ensure that sustainability remains a guiding factor in our operations while not compromising other aspects. 

In FY2020, we have prioritised health and safety, which is essential amid a pandemic. In all our operations, 

we support the communities in which we operate, respect human rights and aim to be socially and 

environmentally responsible.

Learning &amp; Development

We stay dedicated to our aim of empowering employees to reach their full potential. We collaborate to 

drive performance and give our people more say, new capabilities, new mechanised tools, and new avenues 

for technology. We invest in our workforce by providing our employees with opportunities to enhance their 

capabilities and capacity for growth through training.

In FY2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus of our capability building work was on our workers’ 

e-training. Our e-training served as a refresher while further developing our worker’s existing skill set.  

Capability development was crucial to ensuring our workers were able to practice their attained skills and 

procedures while many projects were put on halt due to Covid-19.

Although the usual external skill training courses were suspended during the circuit breaker period, 

our Learning and Development Department managed to complete a total of 18,470 hours of training 

as compared to 26,002 hours in FY2019. To ensure the safety and well-being of our work crew, besides 

external skill set trainings, our training program largely focused on Covid-19 related safety training and 

Workplace Mandatory Safety programmes.

In FY2020, approximately 70% of our craftsman were equipped with at least two core skill sets as compared 

to 46%, a year ago. We continue to develop their skills and improve on their operational capabilities. This 

is to ensure our operations are carried out safely, productively and reliably. We invest in our workers to 

ensure excellent performance.

Our workforce in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Myanmar form the foundation of our business. We 

believe that supporting the well-being of our people and promoting an inclusive and diverse culture is 

vital to maintaining a competitive advantage. We engage employees of various nationalities and source 

contractors globally.

Our people policies

We have a comprehensive framework that dictates our employees’ policies and procedures. These policies 

support our organisational culture and drive our focus on safety and productivity. Our employees’ handbook 

provides the guideline for internal disputes, grievance handling processes, our values and highlights the 

expected code of conduct for all employees. 

Inclusion and diversity

Our inclusive and diverse workplace underpins our ability to attract new employees. We employ, develop 

and promote employees based on their strengths and do not tolerate any form of discrimination, bullying, 

harassment, exclusion or victimisation. Our systems, processes and company culture are established to 

support fair treatment for all. Our recruitment policies and procedures were developed to reduce potential 

bias in areas of recruitment. We advocate racial and gender diversity in our workplace regardless of race 

or religion. 

Respect is one of our key values and we believe it is fundamental to building stronger teams at our 

workplace. Our Care, Intervene and Thank (CIT) Campaign was established to advocate the value of 

respect and continuous cohesive improvement for all employees. The aim of this campaign is to encourage 

employees to intervene and speak up when they identify areas for improvement. 

Racial Diversity

The increase in the number of foreign workers in FY2020 as compared to FY2019 was mainly due to the 

award of additional maintenance coverage areas by our business partners of the Group. 

Gender Diversity

While we provide all genders equal opportunities for employment, our on-site direct work crew remains 

very male dominated. However, we are seeing an increase  of women in our supporting and management 

roles in the Group in FY2020. We have approximately 4.2% more female employees than at the end of 

FY2019. This female representation outcome is a marked improvement compared to approximately 3.8% 

in FY2016.

Multi-generational Workforce

The percentage of matured employees hired to work for the Group in FY2020 was approximately 3.% 

higher than those in FY2019. With our proactive training and development approach, we aim to build an 

inclusive workplace that offers equal employment opportunities regardless of age.

Corporate Citizenship 

Mun Siong Engineering believes in giving back to the community. Each year we commit ourselves to 

extending our efforts to support volunteer activities as well as support charitable causes through corporate 

giving. This year, we managed to contribute back to society just before the emergence of Covid-19. 





In January 2020, before the Covid-19 outbreak, our Specialised Services Team went to Batam and took time 

to distribute staple food items to two orphanages there.  



In January 2020, Mun Siong Engineering Limited also contributed by providing necessities for people 

affected by the Taal Volcano Eruption in hopes of alleviating the difficulties faced by the affected people.  



Mun Siong Engineering Limited | Sustainability Report 2020

12


Employee Engagement

Our people are the driving force of our business. We prioritise in developing an environment where our 

employees are able to foster close relationships while having a work-life balance. As part of our employee 

welfare efforts, we organised recreational activities that allow our people to unwind and reward them 

for their contributions towards the Group operations. We believe that having a capable and motivated 

workforce will also strengthen our Group’s performance.

Ethics and Business Conduct

Originating from a family business, we strongly believe that ethical behaviour cultivates a culture of 

inclusion, care and trust. Having such a culture will help us attain improved performance and establishes 

strong relationships with all our stakeholders. We align our orientations programs and trainings with our 

vision and core values to show our workforce the behaviour that we advocate within the Group. 

Anti-corruption

Corruption not only misallocates resources, it also reinforces income inequality, undermining the 

integrity of government and community decision-making. We conduct our business in a transparent and 

accountable manner and work with business partners, the government and the community to ensure this 

anti-corruption conduct is strictly enforced within the Group.

Our mandatory compliance with anti-corruption is embodied in our code of conduct for employees and our 

corporate governance. We have a specific anti-corruption procedure that sets out mandatory requirements 

to identify and manage the risk of anti-corruption laws being breached. Our anti-corruption processes are 

regularly reviewed by our Service Excellence Division and approved by the finance director. 

The anti-corruption policy governs the frameworks for key compliance risks, including anti-bribery and 

corruption. We recognise the importance of ongoing efforts to strengthen anti-corruption. Anti-corruption 

risk assessments form a critical part of our program because an adequate set of controls is instrumental in 

managing the risk exposures. 

Our anti-corruption policy prohibits authorising, offering, giving or promising anything of value directly or 

indirectly to any business partners, suppliers or government officials with the intention of influencing the 

receiver’s decisions. 

The company also sends out timely reminders to all employees during the festive season, not to offer 

any form of gifts, with the intention of influencing the receiver’s decisions. We regularly remind our 

employees of our anti-corruption code. The anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies are clearly stated in 

our employees’ handbook as well as in our purchasing policy. 

Safe Environment to Speak Up

It is important that our stakeholders feel safe to highlight any issues that they have identified as a mismatch 

in our Group’s core values. We encourage anyone to report unethical, inconsistent or illegal conduct that 

does not align with our code of governance and corporate policy, and to do so without fear of retaliation. 

Our Functional Directors are directly involved in resolving differences and disputes at site. We have a zero-

tolerance policy for any form of retaliation and aim to resolve concerns in the most effective way possible.

We also have a Whistleblowing programme whereby reports can be lodged anonymously via the 

Whistleblowing Report form on our website. This form can be accessed by anyone and encourages a 

speak up culture. Concerns raised are sent directly to the Audit Committee Chairman for investigation or 

resolution as appropriate, in accordance with our internal policy and whistle blowing policy. 

Mun Siong Engineering Limited | Sustainability Report 2020

Safety and Health

We are naturally exposed to risks in the line of our work. To prevent accidents, we always emphasize  

the importance of safety. Our safety practices are governed by the Group’s standards for Safety, Health, 

Environment and Risk Management, as well as local regulatory requirements, standards and procedures. 

Following the Group’s risk management and management system guidelines, such as ISO14000, our 

subject matter experts participate in monthly safety meetings to further develop and evaluate safety-

related matters.

Other than our standard safety requirements and procedures that are strictly enforced, plant-specific 

trainings and regular assessments are also imposed on our workers. We enforce preventive measures by 

identifying potential risks in advance and introducing solutions to prevent any accidents from happening. 

We communicate relevant safety information to workers through toolbox talks, work group meetings, pre-

task briefings and safety campaigns. Our Care, Intervene and Thank (CIT) Safety Campaign was established 

to encourage our workers to speak up when they see opportunities for safety performance improvement. 

Safety announcements and policies are also released in various languages to minimize miscommunication 

within our diverse work force. It is essential that all our workers understand the safety procedures that 

we implement and adhere to them strictly. We have a zero tolerance policy for the violation of the twelve 

Life Saving Rules (LSR). Videos that show correct safety procedures are also shared with our workers 

periodically. These efforts are part of our beliefs that safety should always be prioritized. 

To ensure a safe workplace, our workforce must adhere to all mandatory safety requirements set for the 

industry. Our site-specific functional directors are accountable for implementing these requirements and 

ensuring that supporting systems are in place. It is everyone’s responsibility to help to prevent and report 

work place-related injuries and illnesses.

Circuit Breaker Safety Measures

In FY2020, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, we implemented additional requirements to manage the 

health and safety of every individual employee, supplier, business partner and subcontractor. We strictly 

implemented social distancing at our workplace. Our work crew was grouped into different work teams to 

reduce interaction with other teams or with other non-Mun Siong employees. These safety requirements 

were rolled out across our  work sites. 

In line with Covid-19 social distancing regulations, we utilised technology to closely manage and monitor 

the well-being of all. This also helped to minimise our operations being affected. Our attendance scanning 

process was updated from fingerprint recognition scanning to facial recognition scanning. The fingerprint 

recognition scanning was substituted to avoid unnecessary indirect contact between workers and surfaces. 

Safety personnel were engaged to take every employees’ temperature in the morning before work and in 

the evening when they returned to our temporary living quarter (TLQ). 

Safety personnel also supported the delivering of meals to the doorstep of those employees who were 

residing at various hotels, TLQ and government-designated locations during the circuit breaker period. Our 

safety personnel were given greater responsibilities as  safety management officers. They helped to closely 

monitor the well-being of workers at site and ensured safe distancing requirements were strictly adhered 

to. This helped to prevent close proximity between co-workers and minimized infected cases within the 

Group.

We continue to strengthen our safety leadership and culture by educating our people, to be mindful of the 

possibility of what could go wrong and creating a culture in which it is safe to speak up and report hazards 

and incidents. We monitor reporting culture across all our work sites. We coach and support our leaders to 

improve the quality of our field leadership activities within our workforce.

We strive to minimise and mitigate adverse environmental impacts at every stage of our operational 

activities. We have a comprehensive frameworks, policies and processes (including governance and risk 

management) that apply to environmental risks. These frameworks help guide risk management and direct 

us towards our environmental objectives.

Our approach to environmental management is based on the robust identification, assessment and 

management of water and energy consumption across all phases of our operational activities, including 

activities in hydrojetting and pressure testing at our facility. This also includes the management of 

environmental risks in disposing the water discharged from the jetting activities, by having the facility 

at the premise to contain the discharged water and subsequently engaging a professional third party to 

collect the discharged water for further treatment at the service provider’s facility.

Water Conservation

Water conservation is essential to sustaining healthy ecosystems and for everyone’s livelihood. Access 

to safe, clean water is a basic human right. We understand the scarcity of clean water on earth and the 

importance of keeping our water supply safe for future generations. It is a shared responsibility to conserve 

water in the best possible manner. We also set term goals for water consumption and monitor our water 

utilisation. Monthly consumptions are reported through graphs for comparison and control. We use this 

data as a basis for monitoring our efforts in water conservation.

In FY2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our headquarters served as a temporary living quarter (TLQ) 

for approximately 70 foreign workers, under our direct employment, approved by Ministry of Manpower 

(MOM). The increase in water consumption, despite very low work activities on the premise, was due to 

the workers residing at the premise. Due to Covid-19, the consumption chart for FY2020 was not able to be 

benchmarked against the past year’s records.

Electricity Conservation

Covid-19 has brought almost all activities to a halt for the most part of the year. The impact on businesses 

and workers were especially severe during the circuit breaker period. Businesses were unable to operate 

normally and only very a limited number of our essential workers were able to be deployed to site to carry 

out essential services such as maintenance services to ensure the plants are operating safely. Thus, due 

to the limited operational activities, our electricity and diesel consumption for operational purposes were 

reduced as compared to previous years.

 

However, our electricity utilisation for non-operational purposes increased due to our TLQ arrangements 

at HQ to accommodate housing for our foreign workers. The purpose was to separate the essential 

workers and those staying in the dormitories. The number of Covid-19 cases within the dormitories were 

exceptionally high. 

In efforts to reduce our electricity usage, our energy management enforced energy-saving initiatives such 

as replacing fluorescent bulbs with LED bulbs, turning off the lights during lunch break, lowering the air 

conditioner temperature and reminding all workers to switch off the lights or air conditioner when not in 

use. These initiatives have allowed us to maintain acceptable electricity utilisation rates at HQ despite the 

TLQ arrangement compared to previous years. 

Environment

Mun Siong Engineering Limited | Sustainability Report 2020

Diesel usage

Diesel consumption is also one of the key indicators that we monitor to assess our resource conservation 

initiatives. We use diesel in transporting materials and fabricated products from HQ to various sites as 

well as within each job site. Welding machines, compressors and other equipment also require diesel to 

operate. 

Throughout the different phases of the Covid-19 period, we deployed our drivers from various departments 

to use the vehicles to deliver three meals to the doorsteps of where our workers were residing such as 

various hotels, MOM approved living quarters and TLQ. Our fleet of transportation vehicles, which were 

previously assigned for site operations, was thus fully deployed on a daily basis. This led to an increase in 

our diesel consumption.
