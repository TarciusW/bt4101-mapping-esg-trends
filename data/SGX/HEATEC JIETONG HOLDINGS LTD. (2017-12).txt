02

We are pleased to present Heatec Jietong Holdings Ltd.’s (“Heatec”) 

inaugural annual Sustainability Report, for our ﬁ nancial year ended 

31 December 2017 (“FY2017”). This report is set out on a “comply or 

explain” basis in accordance with Rule 711B and Practice Note 7F of 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist. We are guided by the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards reporting guidelines, at Core level. 

Heatec has chosen the GRI framework as it is the most established 

international sustainability reporting standard. In accordance with 

the GRI Standard’s emphasis on materiality, this report highlights key 

environmental, social and governance related initiatives carried out 

throughout FY2017, from 1 January to 31 December 2017.

In deﬁ ning our reporting content, we applied GRI’s principles deﬁ ning 

report content by considering the Group’s activities, impact and 

substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders. We observed 

a total of four principles, including materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, 

sustainability index and completeness. For reporting quality, we 

observed principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, 

clarity and reliability.

The ESG data and information provided have not been veriﬁ ed by an 

independent third party. We have relied on internal data monitoring and 

veriﬁ cation to ensure accuracy.

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our 

sustainability efforts as this enables us to improve our policies, 

systems and results. Please send your comments and suggestions to

BOARD STATEMENT ON SUSTAINABILITY

The Executive Committee (EMCO) leads sustainability efforts at the 

Company to recognise the importance of sustainability. The EMCO 

reports directly to the Board to consider sustainability issues as part 

of its strategic formulation, determine the material environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) factors and oversee the management and 

monitoring of these factors.

Companies are increasingly aware of the impact on environment, social 

and governance affecting long-term continuation of businesses, hence 

sustainability reporting has gained greater signiﬁ cance to investors. 

Today it is widely accepted that good ESG practices contributes to the 

overall long-term success of the company and plays an important part in 

the competition for investment.

Businesses must be quick to adapt to key stakeholders’ concerns, 

close any potential gaps and capitalise on given opportunities. Amid 

today’s rapid business environment, Heatec’s board is fully committed 

in supporting the management to uphold governance and sustainability 

practices to achieve long-term success and value for stakeholders.

2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

HEATEC JIETONG HOLDINGS LTD.











WHAT IS HEATEC’S APPROACH?

SUSTAINABILITY VISION 

At Heatec, we believe that sustainability coupled with innovative and economical initiatives implemented will 

ensure the growth of the company and protect the environment in the long term.

Safety is paramount and this is reﬂ ected in our safety policy 

which begins by saying, “Safety is the responsibility of 

everyone.” The company expects a high level of integrity from 

all our staff at all levels and a clearly deﬁ ned whistleblowing 

policy is in place. A conﬁ dential contact point is available to 

anyone who wishes to express their concerns.

Heatec is building up in-house expertise to run 

sustainability reporting capabilities.

Heatec’s 

strategy 

focuses 

on 

overall 

business 

diversiﬁ cation through product diversiﬁ cation and 

market diversiﬁ cation.

Our company motto, “Doing the Right Thing Right, First 

Time, Everytime”, is displayed prominently on a banner 

across the entire workshop and embedded in processes 

as an integral part of our working culture.

Heatec strives to reduce costs while maintaining quality. 

We will continually carry out cost reduction initiatives 

through use of multiple suppliers and through ﬁ nding 

new vendors to continue to provide ever higher quality 

services at reasonable prices.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

and materiality


06

As a good and responsible corporate citizen, we have a strong 

commitment in sustainability and part of that is to ensure the 

commitment is conveyed to our stakeholders in term of Economic, 

Social and Governance criteria.

Heatec has a clearly deﬁ ned whistleblowing policy to raise concerns in 

conﬁ dence with ﬁ nancial reporting or other matters. The whistleblowing 

email and telephone number are maintained by Heatec’s internal 

auditors. Issues are then elevated to the internal audit committee, 

forensic professionals or law enforcement as appropriate. While the 

current policy focuses primarily on economic and safety issues, going 

forward, the whistleblowing policy will be revised to explicitly include 

issues of sustainability.

Given that this is our inaugural report, we do not have sufﬁ cient 

performance data to form a trend for the purpose of setting targets. 

Accordingly, the process of target setting is deferred until a time when 

adequate data is available to set reasonable targets.

Nevertheless, Heatec sets out to meet and exceed all legal requirements 

and industry expectations and have implemented a number of 

benchmarks and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to achieve that goal.

The following are Heatec’s initiatives we intend to work on:

1. 

Enhancing safety standards of operations

2. Continued training of workers

3. HR-related processes such as training, payroll and recruitment

4. Further enhancing its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework 

and processes.

KPIs which are tracked monthly, quarterly and annually are as follows:

















1. 

Get the basics right by establishing better safety and risk 

management practices

2. Drive higher productivity in all our staff

3. Promote environmental sustainability in our business

4. Lead in setting industry standards

5. Ensure adequate safety infrastructure

6. Ensure a conducive environment for all employees

7. 

Strengthen relationship with customers and suppliers

8. Ensure effective implementation of relevant regulations

9. Enhance strategic outreach and engagement.

MATERIAL ASPECTS ASSESSMENT

Our 

sustainability 

process 

begins 

with 

the 

identification of relevant aspects. Relevant aspects 

are then prioritised as material factors which are then 

validated. The end result of this process is a list of 

material factors disclosed in the sustainability report.

We conducted a materiality assessment during 

the year with the help of an external consultant. In 

addition, Heatec adopts a matrix-based approach 

based on likelihood and impact to address the 

Company’s sustainability risk profile and priorities 

issues. We shall use this method to monitor our risk 

profile on regular basis. Going forward, materiality 

review will be conducted every year, incorporating 

inputs from stakeholder engagements.

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we 

will assess its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and the influence on the 

stakeholders.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

At Heatec, we assume the responsibility to ensure that the Company’s 

activities positively impact communities in and around the areas in which 

we operate. We aim to develop training programmes in all locations we 

operate to transfer knowledge to local communities. 

Our CEO actively participates in tertiary institutions’ mentoring 

programme and our subsidiary, ChemGrow, is applying to offer Industrial 

Attachment opportunities to students from tertiary institutions.

We aim to develop training programmes in all locations we operate to 

transfer knowledge to local communities. 

For FY2017, the Company planned and/or completed the following 

activities:

• Meal-on-wheels volunteer programme in association with In-Touch

WHAT DO WE BRING TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES?

VALUE TO SOCIETY


16

ENERGY

As electricity consumption is extensive in our operations, it will be an 

item which we will monitor more closely going forward.

For ofﬁ ce operations, Heatec has consolidated from three to two ﬂ oors 

with corresponding savings in energy use.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

Heatec has round-the-clock monitoring through a National Environmental 

Agency-approved waste afﬂ uent system. The Company runs an extensive 

recycling programme as part of this system.

Chemical waste as a byproduct of operations are recycled where 

possible. What is left over is responsibly treated before safe disposal.

The Company uses a 3-R approach advocating minimisation of 

segregation of production waste to minimise resource use, using them 

again and again instead of passing it on to the waste stream as recycling 

the materials goes a long way in achieving the goals of sustainability. It 

reduces pressure on our resources as well as reduces waste generation 

and pollution.

Ofﬁ ce operations have implemented two-sided printing to save paper.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

In FY2017, there were no incidence of non-compliance with laws and 

regulations resulting in signiﬁ cant ﬁ nes or sanctions, and we endeavor 

to maintain this track record.

WHAT ARE OUR TOP ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT A LOCAL LEVEL?

ENVIRONMENT


SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE 

In order to achieve the objective to achieve sustainability, the Company 

has formed a Sustainability Committee for better management and 

direction. The Sustainability Committee’s members comprise of the 

Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer (“CFO”), and 

various Head of Department.

We aim to develop some effective programs in reduction of resource 

use to promote sustainability in progressive milestones over the next 

3 years. Committee members will assist in data collection for reporting 

and dissemination of the Sustainability Reporting to stakeholders. We 

aim to have a monthly Sustainability Committee Member’s meeting to 

discuss, review and set targets for the Company’s sustainability issues. 

Any targets behind schedule will be closely monitored and will be 

brought to the attention of all members to resolve any such issues. 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

At Heatec, we believe that strong governance is key to a sustainable 

business. Throughout FY2017, we continue to comply with the Code 

of Corporate Governance. Please refer to the Annual Report for FY2017, 

pages 15 to 37 on the details of the Code of Corporate Governance we 

adhere to.

It is a continual challenge to successfully manage environmental and 

social issues. Heatec is working continuously to incorporate these 

issues into our business model and infuse it into our company culture. 

Our products and services meet all the requirements demanded by our 

customers and the regulatory bodies. We meet all environmental and 

safety standards to operate effectively.

Heatec pays close attention to enforce good labour practices in all 

our operations. The company provides many training opportunities for 

continued employee development and this is reﬂ ected in the quality

see us into the future. Heatec strongly believes that in the long run, 

these efforts will have a positive impact on our economic performance.

2017 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

HEATEC JIETONG HOLDINGS LTD.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

The Group has an Enterprise Risk Management Framework in place to 

manage its exposure to risks that are associated with the conduct of 

its business. The Board will continue its risk assessment, which is an 

on-going process, with a view to improve the Group’s internal control 

system.

 

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Cyber security and data privacy are important not just for compliance 

but to safeguard both our data and that of our customers. Heatec takes 

measures to guard against cyber risks for both our internal and external 

stakeholders. We comply with the Personal Data Protection Act Policy. 

This policy also applies to our employment process where the privacy of 

all applicants is safeguarded, securely backed-up and access to personal 

data is restricted to authorised persons and senior management on a 

need-to-know basis.

BUSINESS ETHICS, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND 

COMPLIANCE

For FY2017, there were no signiﬁ cant ﬁ nes or non-monetary sanctions 

for non-compliance with laws and regulations. Here at Heatec, we do 

not tolerate corruption in any form. This has been made clear to all of 

our employees, our suppliers and our business partners. Any reports of 

corruption are escalated to the attention of the Board. There have also 

been no reported incidents of corruption during the reporting period. It is 

Heatec’s goal to maintain zero incidents of corruption. We will regularly 

review policies on whistleblowing and anti-corruption.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our 

stakeholders and material aspects relevant to our business. The interests 

and requirements of key stakeholders are also taken into account when 

formulating corporate strategies. These key stakeholders include, but not 

limited to, customers, suppliers, employees, investors, and regulators. 

We adopt both formal and informal channels of communication to 

understand the needs of key stakeholders, and incorporate these into 

our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneﬁ cial relationships.

Heatec currently engages with our shareholders regularly via multiple 

channels such as annual general meetings, SGX-ST announcements, 

press releases and the company website.

Internally, strategies and initiatives are disseminated through the 

hierarchy through meetings such as our monthly management meeting, 

project meetings, safety meetings and daily toolbox meetings. Internal 

memos are also circulated via email and hard copies posted on 

noticeboards.

Key external suppliers are also audited annually for quality and 

quality performance as we recognise the importance of stakeholders’ 

engagement and strive for continual improvement.

Heatec looks forward to more suggestion and improvements during 

the sustainability reporting implementation process, especially with 

the advice of professional consultants. We have ensured all necessary 

compliance with regulators such as the BCA, SCDF and NEA. We 

regularly engage with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on manpower 

related issues including foreign workers’ documentation and keeping 

up to date with regulatory changes. We work with the NEA and have 

implemented a 24-hour monitoring system for waste efﬂ uent system. 

We are active members of a number of trade associations such as IE 

Singapore, SBF, Spring Singapore, ASMI, ASPRI and SID.
