Our 

approach 

for 

sustainability 

is 

described 

on 

our 

website  

https://www.uol.com.sg/sustainability/our-approach. This report focuses on 

performance data and commentary of our material environmental, social and 

governance issues for the period 1 January to 31 December 2017. The report 

is published annually, and is UOL’s fifth sustainability report. Our sustainability 

report for FY2016 was published on 31 May 2017.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option, and includes consideration of the GRI 

Construction and Real Estate Sector Disclosures. The report also complies 

with requirements of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(SGX-ST) Listing Rules Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide. 

Definitions and source of data measurements are indicated in Appendix B. 

The report covers the property development and property investments 

businesses, as well as hotel operations in Singapore, excluding those arising 

from the accounting of United Industrial Corporation Limited (“UIC”) as 

a subsidiary. Assets and revenue from operations covered in the report 

comprise approximately 57% of the Group’s total assets and 58% of the 

Group’s total revenue respectively as at 31 December 20171. The coverage 

had decreased compared to FY2016 due to the consolidation of UIC’s 

figures into the annual report. UIC reports on sustainability separately at  

http://www.uic.com.sg/investor-relations/sustainability-report, and meets 

both SGX and GRI requirements. We intend to expand our scope of 

reporting to include our overseas operations when an operation significantly

contributes to our assets or profit i.e. more than 10%.

We engaged KPMG to perform limited assurance using SSAE 3000 for review 

of our performance data for material aspects reported, alignment with SGX 

Sustainability Reporting requirements under Listing Rules 711A and 711B 

and the GRI Standards: Core option. The assurance statement can be found 

on page 67 of this report.

We welcome your feedback to help us improve our performance in 

sustainability and meet stakeholder’s expectations. Please send your feedback 

to Mr Tan Kian Siew, Deputy General Manager (Corporate Affairs), Chairman 

of the Sustainability Coordinating Committee, at sustainability@uol.com.sg.

REPORT 2017

Dear Stakeholders,

Focus on environmental, social and governance 

issues has gained greater momentum both locally 

and globally in recent years. The Singapore 

government, which ratified the Paris Agreement 

in 2016, demonstrated its commitment to combat 

climate change by declaring 2018 as the Year of 

Climate Action and announced a carbon tax of $5 

per tonne of GHG emissions imposed from 2019, 

with the intention of raising it to between $10 and 

$15 per tonne by 2030. The tax will be imposed on 

primary emitters producing 25,000 tonnes or more 

of GHG emissions in a year, and is expected to be 

passed down at least partially to households and 

companies consuming electricity. 

In line with the global demand for ESG disclosures, 

sustainability reporting will also be required from this 

year onwards by the Singapore Exchange (SGX). 

The Board, supported by the Sustainability Steering 

Committee and Sustainability Coordinating 

Committee, oversees the management of key 

material issues and their performance indicators, 

and has approved this report. For the first time, our 

report is externally assured to have met requirements 

of both SGX and also the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI). In 2017, we are also pleased to maintain our 

inclusion in the SGX Sustainability Leaders Index.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE STATEMENT

Growing 

Responsibly


UOL 

SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT 2017

08

Our vision of being a robust property group that creates value 

and shapes the future will increasingly become more important as 

Singapore places greater emphasis on sustainability. We strongly 

believe in leveraging new construction technologies to improve 

sustainability through employing them in our projects and sharing 

our knowledge in prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction 

(PPVC) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) with the real estate 

community.

Our commercial properties achieved a 7.9% reduction in building 

energy intensity by gross floor area (GFA) occupied, compared to the 

base year of 2010. For reduction in water intensity by GFA occupied, 

our commercial properties achieved and exceeded their target of 10% 

by 2020 with a 18.4% reduction in 2017 compared to the base year of 

2010. 

Our hospitality business exceeded our target by achieving a 28.3% 

reduction of energy intensity by guest night compared to the base 

year of 2013. For reduction in water intensity by guest night, our 

hospitality business met our target by achieving an 23.8% reduction in 

water intensity by guest night, compared to the base year of 2013. We 

believe we are on track towards our long-term target, and will continue 

to adopt best practices to achieve it.

As most of our development projects are in their peak construction 

stages, we recorded an increase of 14.2% in GHG emissions intensity, 

and an increase of 10.2% of water intensity from 2016 to 2017. We 

are closely monitoring the environmental footprint of our development 

projects and have adopted technologies such PPVC to reduce the 

environmental footprint of our construction activities.

We maintained a good safety track record in 2017, with an accident 

frequency rate of 0.6 and accident severity rate of 5.5, both well below 

the respective national industry averages of 1.6 and 104. We will 

continue with our initiatives towards a workplace with zero incidences, 

maintaining focus on high occupational safety standards and engaging 

our contractors.

We have a responsibility to create a fair and respectful workplace, and 

believe a diversified team that supports gender equality, different age 

groups, backgrounds and skillsets, will bring forth broader and more 

enriching perspectives to the workplace. For our hospitality business, 

we will revamp the Service Excellence 2.0 programme and rebrand 

it as Project Atlas to focus on service culture, leadership and self-

development programmes this year. Group turnover rate decreased 

slightly from 32.1% in 2016 to 32.0% in 2017.

Supporting and caring for our community has become part of our 

culture. We are pleased to see continued commitment amongst our 

staff in volunteering their time to give back to the community. 

At UOL, we believe that the journey towards sustainability will foster 

innovation and future-proof us against ESG risks, so as to continue to 

create value for all our stakeholders. We look forward to your continuous 

support as we strive towards a sustainable future beyond generations.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

SDGS FOR UOL

UOL'S IMPACT AND CONTRIBUTION

SDG 3:

Good Health and 

Well-being

As a provider of living, working and leisure spaces, promoting 

good health and well-being of our workforce and customers is our 

responsibility. We have a strong focus on occupational health and 

safety and offer healthcare insurance to all our employees. We 

actively consider users’ needs, including people with disabilities and 

parents with young children in our developments, properties and 

hotels. We integrate appropriate features where relevant, drawing 

reference to the Code on Accessibility 2013 by the Building and 

Construction Authority (BCA).

SDG 5: 

Gender Equality

Gender diversity is important to us in attracting and retaining talent. 

We also recognise our shared responsibility in fostering a more 

productive and equal society. We recruit, develop and reward our 

employees in a fair and inclusive manner, as demonstrated by our 

pledge in support of The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment 

Practices (TAFEP). We also provide flexible work arrangements in 

the form of part-time work, which are considered and adjusted 

based on the needs of the department and individual.

SDG 8: 

Decent Work 

and Economic 

Growth

Developing our employees' capabilities ensures that UOL maintains 

a competitive advantage. We recognise that people are our leading 

asset and a key focus in executing our strategy, in both our lean 

property development business as well as our service-oriented 

hospitality business. Through our People Development and 

Health and Safety policies, we are committed to developing the 

full potential of our close to 2000-strong workforce, and providing 

them a safe and healthy work environment. 

SDG 9: 

Industry, 

Innovation and 

Infrastructure

We are dedicated towards incorporating innovative design and 

quality excellence in the buildings we develop. For example, we 

are one of the early adopters of PPVC and advocate for BIM. These 

technologies not only improve the quality of our buildings, but also 

reap positive social and environmental impact such as improved 

workers safety, and reduced dust and noise at construction sites.

We promote sustainable practices in our hospitality business as 

well, through sharing and encouraging other companies to hire 

employees with disabilities and using local produce where possible.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

SDGS FOR UOL

UOL'S IMPACT AND CONTRIBUTION

SDG 11: 

Sustainable 

Cities and 

Communities

We actively consider sustainable design in all our development 

and investment properties, and hotels. We are also committed to 

advancing local talent. In a densely populated and vibrant city like 

Singapore, we focus on designing buildings with features to reduce 

GHG emissions, and explore ways to preserve the environment’s 

inherent character and cultural heritage. We are also mindful of 

users’ needs, including people with disabilities and parents with 

young children. 

We also support knowledge-sharing on innovation in the industry 

through events such as the biennial World Cities Summit, where 

government leaders and industry experts convene to address 

challenges of liveable and sustainable cities. As an early adopter of 

technologies, we are also privileged to have government leaders and 

regulators requesting for sharing of innovative solutions that we have 

implemented, such as our use of PPVC for The Clement Canopy.

SDG 12: 

Responsible 

Consumption 

and Production

We engage our key stakeholders on sustainable consumption and 

production to positively impact the construction and hospitality 

industry value chain. In our property development business, all 

our main contractors are OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 certified. 

We also actively review and monitor the safety and environmental 

performances of main contractors at the selection and project 

implementation phases. As our hospitality business consumes 

large quantities of products, we can influence our suppliers with 

our preference for environmentally-friendly and socially-conscious 

products that are also commercially feasible. We apply various 

criteria including ISO 14001 certification, Forest Stewardship 

Council (FSC) certification, FSC Chain-of-Custody certification and 

Singapore Green Label.

SDGS FOR UOL

UOL'S IMPACT AND CONTRIBUTION

SDG 13:

Climate Action

UOL is committed to combat climate change and its impact by 

regulating GHG emissions through the reduction of energy and 

water usage. We play our part by managing our carbon footprint in 

response to climate change concerns, and prepare our business to 

operate effectively in a low-carbon scenario. We have set targets 

for energy reduction across all our properties in Singapore, and 

adopt systematic environmental management systems to regularly 

measure and drive performance. We also aim to positively impact 

the wider industry, for example, by requiring our main contractors 

to be ISO 14001 certified.

SDG 16: 

Peace, Justice 

and Strong 

Institutions

UOL adopts a zero tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption. 

Through our Code of Business Conduct (CBC) which sets out 

expectations of employees in relation to issues such as fraud, bribery, 

conflicts of interests, anti-competitive conduct, harassment, health, 

safety and environment, we are committed to conduct our business 

with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws. We respect 

the rights and interests of our employees, our business partners, 

customers and the communities where we operate. We support 

diversity and elimination of discrimination in all our operations.

SDG 17: 

Partnerships for 

the Goals

We actively seek to form long lasting and strong partnerships, 

forged on respect, trust and mutual benefit, with our stakeholders. 

In our description of the SDGs above, we illustrate how we engaged 

external stakeholders such as the building and hospitality industries, 

government, regulators and our suppliers including main contractors 

to promote sustainable practices. An example is our move to 

incorporate smart facilities in our developments, in response to the 

call by the government to move towards a Smart Nation.

We are dedicated towards incorporating design and 

technology in the buildings we develop. We also 

support knowledge-sharing on innovation in the 

industry. One example of an innovative technology 

is BIM, which we illustrate in a case study in this 

report. At the BIM Symposium 2017 organised by the 

Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore,  

Mr Liam Wee Sin, Deputy Group Chief Executive 

Officer, spoke on the crucial role technologies such 

as BIM can play in improving productivity and quality 

to help create sustainable and smart buildings 

to transform cities and industries. In 2018, we will 

continue to execute and hone our capabilities in 

PPVC, BIM and Smart Nation technologies for our 

property business. 

For our hospitality business, we continue to 

benchmark our performance using an external Quality 

Assurance specialist, in addition to close monitoring 

of satisfaction surveys and reviews on multiple 

platforms. Our planned initiatives to continuously 

improve our Service Quality can be found under the 

People Development section, as training is the key 

factor to achieving enhanced service excellence.

EMBRACING TECHNOLOGIES FOR SAFE 

AND EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION, AND 

STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS

One Bishopsgate Plaza, London, UK

BIM has become an exciting development that the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has 

identified to be a “key technology to improve productivity and level of integration across various disciplines 

across the entire construction value chain”2. BCA is actively encouraging BIM, including through its S$250 

million Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF)3 . 

At its simplest, BIM is a 3D modelling tool. This departure from traditional two-dimensional technical 

drawings enables sophisticated and early identification of problems, for example through its clash 

detection feature. Clash detection prevents problems that would otherwise be discovered during the 

assembly stage, such as misalignments of different components.

The full potential of BIM is harnessed when it is used as an integrated design and documentation tool. A 

building project involves multiple partners – architects, developers, engineers, main contractors and sub-

contractors. With BIM, information from all disciplines can be incorporated in a single shared model, which 

is a game changer in improving project coordination and reducing information losses. However, currently in 

Singapore, BIM adoption is not widespread enough for this to be implemented across the value chain. 

Our international footprint means that we gain hands-on experience from markets advanced in BIM use like 

London, with our mixed development project One Bishopsgate Plaza. 

By using BIM and prefabrication together, we enhance the quality and confidence in what we build. The precise 

information from BIM allows for more construction work to be undertaken off-site in a controlled manner. BIM 

reduces conflicts and raises confidence in building plans. Accurate fabrication of materials reduces waste while 

pre-assembly can save time. Sizing of components is accurate and complex designs can be modelled prior 

to prefabrication. For example, repetitive components can be fabricated off-site in a controlled environment 

where testing and inspections can also be carried out prior to bringing the assemblies to site. 

We are fabricating bathroom pods for One Bishopsgate Plaza’s hotel and residential components, which are 

fully assembled in Italy, tapping into the skilled workforce there. Each pod comprises all interior finishes – 

integrated servicing, such as underfloor heating, drainage, electrical and ventilation systems, and all sanitary 

ware accessories and interior fixings such as towel rails, mirrors and shower doors. Prefabricating in Italy is 

not reliant on the site conditions in London and with BIM the accuracy of modelling means there are very few 

errors. Additional software can be used for visualisation, walk-throughs, tracking along the production line 

and testing and commissioning prior to shipping. Final visual inspections in the factory will highlight defects 

that can all be cleared before shipping, hence dramatically reducing rework on site. Each pod is tracked 

along the production line via software that is developed for mobile tablets. QR codes are used to track the 

various stages in the process.

BIM greatly facilitates tighter coordination between teams. We have relied on BIM and in-house software to 

coordinate the design, and to track the sequencing of construction and readiness for delivery. This process adds to 

the ability to have accurate reporting on progress and informs the construction manager if there are bottlenecks. 

Working on this full BIM development project has greatly enhanced our expertise in the field. As an early 

adopter of BIM technology, we are poised to take advantage of opportunities to utilise BIM to work on 

projects in Singapore, when it becomes more prevalent.

SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT 

THROUGH KNOWLEDGE-SHARING

The Clement Canopy

As an early adopter in building technologies, we welcome the opportunity to share our experiences for the 

advancement of the industry. 

We reported in our previous sustainability report that we have embarked on our first PPVC project for 

The Clement Canopy, a 505-unit condominium that comprises two 40-storey towers in Clementi Avenue 1. 

Adopting PPVC improves workers’ safety with reduced exposure working at heights, and also reduces dust 

and noise levels on site. Besides PPVC, our main contractor Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd also employs 

BIM to study the PPVC modules interfaces as well as the coordination of the mechanical and electrical 

installation within and between each module. 

We are encouraged that our stakeholders are keen to learn more about our experiences with PPVC. In 

September 2017, we hosted Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development and Government 

Parliamentary Committee members Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Louis Ng at The 

Clement Canopy’s site. On 14 November 2017, at the request of BCA, Dragages Singapore hosted 

international delegates from Australia, Austria, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 

Scotland, Sweden and the USA.

SMART NATION: ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY USE 

FOR RESIDENTS AND SHOPPERS

The Clement Canopy and OneKM

UOL supports the move in Singapore towards a Smart Nation with initiatives across our properties and 

developments. For our residential development project, The Clement Canopy, residents will be able to invite 

their friends who can access the condominium with ease through an e-invite system, which facilitates and 

reduces security’s duties. In addition, residents can make use of the condominium application to enjoy the 

discounts offered by many online delivery companies. For added convenience, The Clement Canopy also 

offers control of front door lock, control of air-conditioning on/off switch and booking of facilities remotely 

from anywhere via a smart phone application.

UOL has started to roll out initiatives at our malls that are aligned with the move towards a smart cashless 

society with contactless payment. Our retail mall OneKM offers an online carpark rebate redemption scheme 

for shoppers’ convenience. The carpark redemption is done via the mall’s website where shoppers fill in 

their details and submit a photo of one or more receipts. The concierge will then process the redemption 

received, allowing shoppers to drive out free of charge once the process is completed.

The aim of the scheme is to allow ease of shopping at our malls, especially for shoppers who may be in the 

midst of dining and do not have time to visit the concierge. It is one of our retail malls’ online initiatives to 

meet the changing needs of shoppers and to be more efficient in our work processes. In addition, we hope 

to reduce the reliance on paper tickets and adopt more sustainable practices.

used in our energy and water targets for 

our commercial properties and hospitality 

business are GFA occupied and guest 

nights 

respectively. 

Notwithstanding, 

intensity data for the Group is available 

on a by GFA basis in Appendix A.

Hotels have the highest energy and water 

intensities based on property types, and 

also form the largest contributor to our 

building energy and water consumption. 

In 2017, we set our target to reduce 

energy and water intensity by guest night 

by 27% and 25% respectively from 2013 

to 2020, inclusive of both years. This 

target applies to our hospitality business, 

which includes hotels and serviced suites.

In 2017, we had incorporated OneKM, 

our retail mall, into our target for 

commercial 

properties. 

Despite 

the 

higher energy intensity for a retail 

property type compared to offices and 

mixed developments, we decided to 

face the challenge in maintaining 16% 

reduction of energy intensity by GFA 

occupied from 2010 to 2020, inclusive of 

both years.

INTEGRATING UOL VALUES IN 

PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS

We strongly believe that the quality of our people defines the organisation. We developed Six Cs 

(Competitive, Committed, Competent, Creative, Collaborative and Caring), which are qualities and 

attributes that depict our unique UOL culture. These values are based on behavioural evidence of what 

we do day to day, not aspiration based. 

The 6Cs serve to guide us in recruiting and developing talents. These qualities shape our attitude and 

behaviour, and are demonstrated in our work conduct and interaction with each other. In 2017, with 

the assistance of a global executive search firm, the 6Cs have been incorporated into our Competency 

Framework, performance appraisals and recruitment interviews. The 6Cs are articulated as below:

We are Competitive. We have an enterprising spirit, and are focused and driven. We are agile and 

responsive to stakeholders’ needs and market changes. We embrace challenges and have the will and 

resilience to succeed.

 

We are Committed. We are passionate and have a high level of ownership and self-accountability. We 

take responsibility for our conduct and outcomes. We are thorough and timely. 

We are Competent. We take pride in quality work and professional excellence. We are proficient and 

knowledgeable in our areas of expertise. We are effective and have strong execution capabilities. We 

seek pragmatic solutions. 

We are Creative. We are innovative and receptive to new ideas, opportunities and ways of doing things. 

We aspire to create value for the organisation. 

We are Collaborative. We work as a team and leverage each other’s strengths. We look for common ground 

and seek to understand each other’s perspectives. We are objective and strive for win-win outcomes. 

We are Caring. We value our people, treating them fairly and with respect. We endeavour to contribute 

to the community and build a sustainable environment.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

WORKFORCE BY GENDER

As diversity and inclusion is a material issue, 

particularly for our hospitality business, we 

believe that supporting workplace diversity 

will enrich our perspectives and attract high-

calibre candidates from the widest talent 

pool. We can draw from the expertise of a 

workforce with nearly 20 nationalities across 

the Group.  

In our hospitality business, 45% of the 

Senior Management of various business 

units were female while 55% were male. 

In our property business, 44% of Senior 

Management were female while 56% 

were male. We also continued to practice 

the re-employment of mature workers. In 

2017, 22.8% of employees in our property 

business and 19.4% of employees in our 

hospitality business were above the age of 

50. We encourage and provide a supportive 

environment for our employees with children. 

All employees in our property and hospitality 

businesses were entitled to parental leave.

We leverage and develop skills in our local 

community. In our hospitality business, 

79.1% of Senior Management and 53.5% 

of the employees were Singaporeans or 

Permanent Residents as at end December 

2017. In our property business, all of 

the Senior Management and 98.0% of 

the employees were Singaporeans or 

Permanent Residents as at end December 

2017. We align ourselves with Singapore’s 

national targets on diversity and inclusion 

in our workforce.

FOSTERING INCLUSION AT OUR WORKPLACE, 

AND BEYOND

As part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion, PPHG organised a highly successful seminar 

on “Fostering Inclusion at the Workplace” in collaboration with presenting partners United Overseas 

Bank (UOB), SG Enable and Central Singapore Community Development Council. SG Enable is an 

agency dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities and building an inclusive society. Graced by 

then-Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) Mr S Iswaran, the event was attended by 160 business 

leaders and human resource practitioners from more than 80 companies, including leading hospitality 

players Marina Bay Sands, Grand Hyatt Singapore and Raffles Hotel Singapore.

Through the seminar, it is hoped that sharing of best practices by PPHG and UOB will encourage other 

business leaders in the industry to join them in inclusive hiring. Pan Pacific Singapore was the first hotel 

in Singapore to pilot SG Enable’s School-to-Work Transition Programme (S2W), which offers customised 

training pathways and work options for students with disabilities who have the potential to work.

Two memorable success stories from the programme are 18-year-old Noramira Mohd Amin and 19-year-old 

Brenda Tay Wan Ying, who both have intellectual disabilities. Over several months of patient training from 

their supervisors and team mates, they were offered full-time employment at the hotels under PPHG. 

Noramira (left) and Brenda shared that their work has helped them grow in confidence





Noramira and Brenda are two of more than 30 individuals with disabilities who had undergone training at 

the hotels under PPHG in Singapore. The trainees have shown good progress to date, with a total of four 

converted to full-time roles.

Leaders at the seminar concluded that employees with disabilities widen the talent pool, and build brand 

loyalty and engagement. For some, a more diverse workplace has led to flourishing creativity and higher 

employee satisfaction.  

We are committed to enabling individuals with disabilities by providing them with meaningful and 

sustainable employment opportunities. We encourage like-minded companies to join us to promote an 

inclusive and diverse workplace. We are pioneering new initiatives for the hospitality sector towards the 

full integration of employees with disabilities into the workplace. In view of the successful pilot run and our 

ongoing job mapping, we will continue working with SG Enable to roll out the School-to-Work programme 

in all five of our Singapore hotels in 2018, with the aim of preparing 20 trainees for employment by the 

end of 2018.

The average training hours per employee

In 2017, we developed a training roadmap 

throughout each level of our employees’ 

careers for each hospitality property, as 

well as for the corporate office. This will be 

implemented in 2018, where employees will 

receive training on a wider range of high-

quality courses guided by the roadmap. 

Further, in 2018, we plan to revamp our 

training programme addressing topics 

such as service skills, service mindset, 

service culture and service leadership, for 

employee and leadership levels.

COMMUNITY

Our community development initiatives 

provide opportunities for our employees 

to give back to the society in which we 

operate. 

In 2017, we supported CARE Singapore’s 

StarKidz! Programme through our staff 

volunteerism efforts. This programme 

aims to help improve the self-esteem 

of 

vulnerable 

children 

who 

struggle 

academically, 

so 

they 

can 

become 

responsible and confident adults. 

In June 2017, 23 UOL volunteers brought 

26 children from the programme to the 

Army Museum of Singapore. The museum 

provides an insight into the history of 

the Singapore Army, and honours the 

contribution of soldiers and their families. 

The children visited the SAFTI Military 

Institute and saw real soldiers in training, 

which we hope inspired a sense of discipline 

and purpose in the children.

We also hosted 22 children from CARE 

Singapore and 30 students from Pathlight 

School at our Come Get Wild With Us 

event at United Square in August 2017. 

We transformed the mall atrium into an 

experiential tropical rainforest, complete 

with lush foliage and live exotic animals. 

In addition to staff volunteerism, we also 

provided sponsorships and donations to 

help fund programmes run by charitable 

organisations in our immediate community 

in Novena/Thomson. 

We supported the Riding for the Disabled 

Association of Singapore (RDA Singapore) 

by sponsoring one of its horses, which 

provide horse-riding therapy to children and 

adults with physical and mental disabilities. 

In June 2017, we also brought the horses 

from RDA Singapore to United Square to 

generate awareness for the organisation.

To help needy children improve their 

physical, mental and emotional well-being, 

we also made a donation to the Art Therapy 

Programme at KK Women’s and Children’s 

Hospital. The free sessions support the 

young patients’ recovery through the 

creative process of making art, helping 

them better manage their inner feelings 

and strengthening their resilience.

In our hospitality business, PPHG has been 

offering employment opportunities to 

people with disabilities, as well as internship 

opportunities for students with special 

needs. For more information, please refer 

to the case study under the Diversity and 

Inclusion section on page 35.

We also expanded the reach of our Eat Well 

With Us initiative from four to ten charity 

homes in 2017. First launched in 2015 by 

PPHG in conjunction with National Council 

of Social Service, senior chefs from PPHG’s 

Singapore hotels and Si Chuan Dou Hua 

Restaurant impart culinary recipes and tips 

to the homes’ resident cooks, enabling 

them to prepare tastier and nutritious meals 

for their residents. The recipes considered 

the homes’ budgets and the dietary needs 

of the beneficiaries, such as children and 

the elderly.

SUSTAINABLE FOOD FOR GOOD

As part of our commitment to care for our wider community, PPHG continued the Eat Well Do Good 

initiative which started in 2016. Partnering with The Food Bank Singapore in support of World Food Day, 

a global day of action against hunger, we harnessed the collective experience of the senior chefs from our 

five Singapore hotels, who created special dishes made from ingredients which were sourced locally from 

Comcrop, a high-tech rooftop farm, and other local farms in Singapore. 

Comcrop’s urban farming methods greatly reduce the distance food crops have to travel, which means 

fresher and more nutritious products. The dishes were featured at the hotels’ restaurants, where diners 

joined our chefs in doing good, as we donated a portion of sales proceeds from 15 July to 15 August 2017 

to purchase wholesome food bundles for 1,722 low-income households. 

We continue to support local farmers on an ongoing basis, sourcing local produce for our buffet dishes and 

catering menus. Through our support of local produce, we hope that diners and peers will be encouraged 

to understand our food sources and have access to nutritious and quality produce.

PPHG is also stepping up efforts to address food waste through food preparation and leftovers. We use 

“forward-planning” of menus which helps operations, and reduces food waste, thereby reducing our 

carbon footprint. PARKROYAL on Beach Road employs a system which monitors reservations and the 

availability of its F&amp;B outlets in real-time. The culinary team has access to the system to align its market list 

according to demand, which leads to better management of our food inventory. In a similar fashion, food 

preparation is closely tailored to the reservation covers received daily at Pan Pacific Orchard, where food 

for the buffet counters are cooked when requested and replenished according to demand. 

PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road has found innovative ways of recycling food, such as using unconsumed 

bread from the breakfast buffet to make Bread Butter Pudding as a dessert item for dinner. The hotel’s 

Executive Chef Low Hoe Kiat famously created the signature Slow-braised Pumpkin Crab in Claypot with 

the pumpkins used as decorations for Halloween! 

We order according to the size of the event as far as possible. At Pan Pacific Singapore, we channel 

unconsumed pastries from events to the associates’ cafeteria. We are looking to better manage food waste 

at our hotels in various ways, such as food waste digester machines which can convert solid food waste 

materials into either liquid nutrient or reusable water. PARKROYAL on Beach Road is currently piloting such 

a machine and we are looking at how this can work for the rest of the hotels in Singapore, in particular for 

the largest, 790-room Pan Pacific Singapore.

Development projects: Refers to construction and redevelopment activities that took place in 

Singapore, including joint ventures with UIC. Data from Spottiswoode Residences was excluded 

due to limitations of data collection; the exclusion affected data from 2010 to 2013. Data from 

2010 to 2014 included Archipelago, a joint venture with UIC where the contract was structured 

such that UIC had operational control of the development phase. Riverbank@Fernvale was 

completed in Q1 2017. 

Corporate office: Refers to electricity consumption at UOL’s corporate office, based on utility 

bills. Water data is unavailable, as water is not separately metered. Our corporate office sits 

within United Square, and forms a subset of the building energy and water figures reported.

Coverage within buildings: Data from tenants was excluded for Mixed Developments, Offices 

and Retail Mall. Data for Hotels and Serviced Suites also excluded tenants, with the exception 

of JTB at Pan Pacific Singapore, whose consumption is not separately monitored or measured.

District Cooling: The BCA Energy Benchmarking Report excludes properties with district 

cooling, which can form a significant part of the energy consumption. One of our hotels, Pan 

Pacific Singapore, uses district cooling technology.

GFA and GFA occupied:  We adopted BCA’s definition for GFA. All covered floor areas of 

a building, except otherwise exempted, uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed 

the gross floor area of the building. Generally, car parks were excluded from gross floor area 

computation.

We also report by GFA occupied basis. GFA occupied is calculated by occupancy rate (simple 

average of monthly occupancy rates) multiplied by gross floor area.

Odeon Towers has a reduced GFA from 23,273 m2 to 23,236 m2 (reduced by 37 m2) effective 

1 July 2015. This is a 0.2% change. We recognised this change in our reporting from 2016 

onwards.

Guest night: We adopted the definition from EarthCheck, a leading tourism benchmarking 

group. Guest night included i) guests/staff staying overnight, ii) day/banquet guests and iii) 

non-resident restaurant guests, as illustrated in the below equation:


UOL 

SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT 2017

52

Guest night = Overnight guests/staff + (Day/banquet guests ÷ 3) + (Non-resident restaurant 

guests ÷ 4)

i) Guests/staff staying overnight: The number of guests staying overnight equals the 

number people staying over each night (including complimentary stays and staff that live 

on-site), added up over the year.

Example: Two people sharing a room for three nights is equal to 6 guest nights (2 x 3)

 

ii) Day guests: Day guests represent the number of non-resident day guests (for example, 

the number of people turning up to use on-site facilities such as a spa, golf course, MICE 

or business centre, but do not stay overnight) added up over the year.

Day guests would also include delegates attending day conferences and/or functions. 

Please note that ‘Day guests’ does not include restaurant covers.

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s fitness centre received an additional 3,750 non-resident 

users. This would be equivalent to 1,250 guest nights (3,750 ÷ 3).

iii) Non-resident restaurant guests: Non-resident restaurant guests represent the number 

of non-resident day guests (for example, the number of people turning up to dine at F&amp;B 

outlets/restaurants, but do not stay overnight) added up over the Benchmarking period 

(typically 365 days).

Example: Over the year, a hotel’s restaurants/F&amp;B outlets received an additional 2,000 non-

resident restaurant users. This would be equivalent to 500 guest nights (2,000 ÷ 4).

Building and development site details including property type, gross floor area and occupancy 

rates are available in UOL Annual Report 2017’s Property Summary, page 66–74.

GHG conversion is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Emission factors for electricity 

generation are sourced from the Energy Market Authority (EMA), 2017. Electricity Grid Emission 

Factor for 2013 - 2016 were updated from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) as additional 

information on heat generation by co-generation plants was available from 2012 onwards. 

Due to this, past year emission data for 2013 to 2016 was restated based on figures from EMA, 

which had a slight (&lt;2%) difference from figures used previously. Greenhouse Gas Protocol 

Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, March 2017 were used for diesel conversions. The 

gases included in the conversion of diesel are CO2, CH4 and N2O. 

Waste intensity is derived by total number of guest nights for simplicity, even though coverage 

is not complete. Guest nights of PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Beach Road are excluded from 

the waste intensity calculations. Waste figures of PARKROYAL on Beach Road included an 

immaterial contribution from The Plaza as data is not separable due to a shared compactor bin. 

Coverage by guest nights has increased from 43% in 2013 to 92% in 2017. We are working on 

improving coverage of waste reporting.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Workplace health and safety data included Development Projects and Hospitality only.

Accident frequency rate is defined as the number of workplace accidents for every one million 

man-hours worked.

Accident severity rate is defined as the number of man-days lost to workplace accidents for 

every one million man-hours worked. The number of man-hours refers to main contractors’ and 

sub-contractors’ hours only, and excludes the Group’s employees’ hours in safety data reported 

for Development Projects. The number of man-hours from contractors and employees in our 

hospitality business are included in safety data reported for Hospitality. Workplace accidents 

must be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) if the accident results in hospitalisation 

for 24 hours or more or medical leave for three days, whether consecutive or not. Fatalities as 

a result of work must also be reported to MOM. For comparability, minor first-aid injuries are 

excluded from data reported, and are tracked for 2 out of 5 development projects in 2017. 

National industry figures were obtained from the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Institute, 

an initiative driven by MOM and WSH Council.

PEOPLE

COMMUNITY

While UOL Management Services (UMS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the working relationship 

is such that UMS is considered to be a contractor supplying facility management services to 

UOL. As such, figures reported for our property business excluded UMS as employees and 

instead report figures relating to UMS under contractors, where applicable.

There were no significant variations in the total number of employees for both our property 

and hospitality businesses.

Scheduled workdays is calculated by 5 days x 52 weeks minus actual public holidays, actual 

annual leave and actual parental leave.

A significant portion of the property development business is performed by our contractors 

during construction. Facilities management services were provided by UOL Management 

Services Pte Ltd; see also note 15.   

Training figures for 2012 to 2015 did not include the corporate office of our hospitality business. 

These figures are provided in 2016 and onwards.

Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year / Number of employees 

as at 31 December 2017.

We track our community contributions internally and currently do not report on it externally, as 

this report is focused on our key material topics.

On 31 August 2017, the Group completed the 

acquisition of 60 million shares in United Industrial 

Corporation Limited ("UIC") from a wholly owned 

subsidiary of Haw Par Corporation Limited. Following 

this acquisition, UIC Group has been accounted 

as a subsidiary of UOL Group in accordance with 

the Financial Reporting Standards (“FRS”) 110 

Consolidated Financial Statements and hence the 

income statement for the financial year ended 31 

December 2017 includes the consolidated results of the 

UIC Group after that date.

To the Directors of UOL Group Limited

We were engaged by the Board of Directors of UOL Group Limited (the Group) to 

provide limited assurance on the accompanying UOL Sustainability Report 2017 for the 

year ended 31 December 2017 (the Report), and the selected Global Reporting Initiative 

Sustainability Reporting Standards disclosures (Selected GRI Disclosures) as identified 

below.

Based on the evidence we obtained from the procedures performed as described in the 

Auditors’ Responsibilities section of our report, nothing has come to our attention that 

causes us to believe that:

(a) 

the Report has not described the sustainability practices on a comply-or-explain

          basis with reference to the following components as listed under Rule 711B of the

          Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) Listing Manual;

          –      Material environmental, social and governance factors;

 

          –      Policies, practices and performance;

          –      Targets;

          –      Sustainability reporting framework; and

          –      Board statement;

(b) 

the Report is not presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Global

          Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards); and

(c) 

the Selected GRI Disclosures as identified in the table below, are not calculated, in

      all material respects, in accordance with the relevant topic-specific disclosures

          requirements in the GRI Standards.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

Management is responsible for:

– 

preparing and presenting the Report in accordance with the GRI Standards and

 

Rule 711B of the SGX Listing Manual, and the information and assertions contained

 

within it;

– 

determining UOL’s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance

 

and reporting, including the identification of stakeholders and material issues;

– 

establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control systems that enable the

 

preparation and presentation of the Report and the selected GRI disclosures that

 

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;

– 

preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring that the Group

 

complies with laws and regulations applicable to its activities; and

– 

ensuring that staff involved with the preparation and presentation of the Report

 

are properly trained, information systems are properly updated and that any

 

changes in reporting encompass all significant reporting units.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s sustainability reporting 

process.

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement in accordance with SSAE 

3000 and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. SSAE 3000 requires that 

we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the 

Report is free from material misstatement. The extent of our work performed depends on 

our professional judgement and our assessment of the engagement risk.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 

responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying 

analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures 

included:

– 

Inquiries of management to gain an understanding of UOL’s processes for

 

determining the material issues for UOL’s key stakeholder groups.

– 

Interviews with senior management and relevant staff at group level and selected

 

property level concerning sustainability strategy and policies for material issues,

 

and the implementation of these across the business.

– 

Interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and business unit level responsible

 

for providing the information in the Report.

– 

Visits to offices and properties operating in Singapore selected on the basis of a

 

risk analysis including the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative criteria.

– 

Enquires about the design and implementation of the systems and methods used

 

to collect and report on the GRI Disclosures, including the aggregation of the 

 

reported information.

– 

Comparing the GRI Disclosures presented in the Report to corresponding  

 

information in the relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant 

 

information contained in such underlying sources has been appropriately included 

 

in the GRI Disclosures.

– 

Reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line 

 

with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance 

 

of the Group.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing 

from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, 

the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially 

lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 

engagement been performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure it is possible  that errors or 

irregularities in the information presented in the Report may occur and not be detected. 

Our engagement is not designed to detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the 

preparation and presentation of the Report, as the engagement has not been performed 

continuously throughout the period and the procedures performed were undertaken on 

a test basis.
