Message from our Chairman  

 

At Soilbuild Construction Group Ltd. (the “Soilbuild”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), 

we have a pragmatic approach towards sustainability. We focus on identifying and putting into practice 

initiatives and programs that deliver real-world and lasting benefits to the society. Today, several of the 

global challenges the world faces directly or indirectly impacts every industry. They include climate 

change, population growth, urbanisation and the shortage of natural resources and raw materials. 

Sustainable products and services will be essential in addressing these challenges and providing us with 

a competitive edge to continue to succeed within our field. Striving to reach our vision we will drive 

construction service development, advance our position and capture market share, while contributing 

to change the world and enabling it to move in a more sustainable direction. 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Soilbuild Construction Group Ltd. has always been committed 

to sustainability and fully supports the adoption of the new SGX sustainability reporting guidelines. The 

Board oversees the Group’s sustainability performance, practices and initiatives and its compliance with 

SGX guidelines on sustainability reporting. As a listed Company, we are also committed to the Code of 

Corporate Governance of Singapore. The Code provides the framework for controls, checks and 

accountabilities and requires the Board to consider sustainability issues in its business decisions. 

Throughout the year, the Board and the Group Management reviewed the Group’s sustainability 

objectives and progress.  

 

The Group continues to embrace new technology and recognise that its adoption and implementation 

in the organisation is key to ensure that we continue to strengthen our position in the construction 

industry. In 2015, the Group was awarded the concept and price tender for the development of an 

Integrated Construction and Precast Hub (“ICPH”). In the ICPH, highly automated manufacturing 

processes has been adopted to offer precast solutions to the built environment sector. To date, the 

construction works for the ICPH has been granted Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) in phases  

and the manufacturing facilities will be operational in the last quarter of 2018. Other than the ICPH, 

the Group also intends to embark on other new construction methodologies and adopt new technologies 

that include Pre-fabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (“PPVC”). The aim is to improve 

construction productivity and be more efficient in our work and processes, while enhancing the quality 

of our buildings and optimising safety measures at construction sites. We are always innovating and 

improving to build properties that are both valuable to our customers and more environmentally 

sustainable. The intersection of sustainability and innovation includes improving our internal 

operations.  

 

We are committed to cultivating a balanced work-life environment for all our employees, as well as to 

developing the new workforce in our industry. We recognise that our employees are invaluable to the 

success of our Group.  Workplace safety continues to be of utmost importance to the Group and we have 

implemented appropriate procedures and policies to mitigate the risks and events to raise awareness, 

especially at the construction sites.  

 

The 2017 Sustainability Report (“Report”) is our first sustainability report and reflects the Group’s 

performance as well as the Group’s strategy and vision for the future. The Report is prepared as per the 

SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide and in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards. Material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues for the Group have been 

identified for 2017 and we will continue to examine our material issues on year on year basis. We aim 

to further strengthen our internal sustainability management framework, processes and procedures. 

 

 

The journey ahead 

 

It is clear that corporations have a responsibility to deliver the responsible products and services, to 

solve local and global issues, and to play a supporting role in changing pro-environment consumer 

behaviour. I believe our industry and Soilbuild, in particular, can be a positive force for change, and that 

we have a great opportunity to be a better responsible business.

The Group is well positioned to deliver regionally across Singapore and Myanmar. The Group recognises 

the importance of establishing resilient relationships with business partners and local authorities to 

keep abreast of prevailing changes in statutory and regulatory requirements in the countries we operate 

in. Internally, the Group has invested in training and sharing sessions for employees to be in touch with 

the latest regulatory changes and the potential impact these changes may have as well as any non-

compliance of regulatory requirements on the businesses. We are statutory member of Singapore 

Business Federation (“SBF”) and full corporate member of Access Solution Industry Association (fka 

Access &amp; Scaffold Industry Association) (“ASIA”). The Group's internal auditors conduct an annual 

review of the effectiveness of the Group's material internal controls, including internal financial 

controls, operational and compliance controls.

Our Sustainability Approach 

 

Sustainability Governance 

 

Organisation-wide sustainability agenda is led by Sustainability team headed by the Director of 

Corporate Services with guidance from the senior management and Board of directors.  The team 

initiates, drives, and monitors various aspects of our sustainability practices, ensuring effective 

integration of Environmental, Social and Governance initiatives into our business operations and 

corporate objectives.

Stakeholder engagement 

 

Stakeholders are defined as groups of people or entities that are directly or indirectly influenced by our 

business operations and outcomes, or that can significantly influence our businesses. Feedback from 

our key stakeholder groups forms a crucial part of our strategic and business planning, and is viewed as 

a valuable insight for the Group to continuously improve our sustainability performance. 

 

Through internal discussion and review with external consultants, key stakeholder groups are identified 

across the entire value chain and each stage of our business life cycle. Engagements with key stakeholder 

groups are planned annually. 

 

Understanding the stakeholders’ concerns and expectations is an essential part of Soilbuild’s 

sustainability approach. Through regular formal and informal engagements, we develop mutually 

beneficial relationships with our stakeholders. As part of our stakeholder engagement process, we 

identified the following key stakeholder groups:

Engagements with Key Stakeholder Groups in 2017 

 

The scope of the stakeholders’ engagement in FY 2017 was limited, mostly on account of the challenging 

local market conditions that impacted our domestic business operations. However, we are committed 

to expand our stakeholders’ engagement methods and use the subsequent output in our future 

disclosures. Soilbuild’s senior management is very much determined to continuously improve upon 

sustainability performance and devotes pre-decided time for the same by engaging with key stakeholder 

groups. The followings are our key stakeholders’ topics and concerns raised and our engagement 

mechanism:

Materiality assessment 

 

Materiality is a critical input into our corporate sustainability strategy because it ensures we provide 

our stakeholders with the sustainability information most relevant to them and our business. To 

determine this, we conduct a formal materiality assessment on a regular basis. In 2017, we completed 

materiality assessments for two regions: Singapore and Myanmar. Led by our consultants, the process 

included interviews with internal stakeholders such as employees and management and internal 

workshops, to identify the most material sustainability issues. The boundary of material topics is 

restricted to our Singapore and Myanmar operations and business partners comprising contractors, 

subcontractors and suppliers. 

 

Soilbuild adopted a systematic four-step approach in determining the material topics for our operations.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To illustrate degree of importance to internal and external stakeholders, the material aspects have been 

plotted on a materiality matrix. Figure below provides an overview of our material topics.

Environmental performance: resource conservation  

 

As an organisation that is committed to sustained growth and shared value creation, we 

adopt responsible practices across our supply chain. These are encapsulated in the various 

policies which govern our business practices and environment stewardship.  

 

(a) Energy efficiency and management 

 

Soilbuild believes in building a greener future and creating a friendlier environment for all our 

stakeholders by minimising the usage of natural resources and the waste in our operations. We have 

implemented an environmental management system to identify and manage environmental 

aspects. These aspects are managed by setting targets and implementing programmes to achieve 

these targets. As an endorsement of our environmental management system, Soilbuild has obtained 

the ISO 14001:2015 certification for the scope of building and civil engineering construction 

services.  

 

Soilbuild has been awarded “BCA Construction Productivity Award 2016” by the Building and 

Construction Authority, as a recognition of Soilbuild’s efforts towards designs, construction 

methods, process and technologies adopted that have significant productivity impact in the 

construction projects. Soilbuild has also been awarded “BCA Green and Gracious Builder Award” 

for Soilbuild’s efforts in promoting environment protection and gracious practices during the 

construction phase of projects. 

 

We believe improvements in energy efficiency will enable our Company to reduce cost and improve 

overall operational efficiency. Integrating energy efficiency considerations into the design and 

construction of our assets can also help to reduce the energy usage (and electricity costs) of our 

customers. Through various operational measures, we maximise energy efficiency across key 

business units and at different stages in the building’s lifecycle. At Soilbuild we have diesel-use 

policy which ensures efficient use of diesel in operations such as in cranes, welding machine, diesel 

generators and air-conditioners. 

 

Examples of energy initiatives in 2017 are: 

 

Table 1 Energy management initiatives at Soilbuild 

 

Energy Initiatives 

✓ Monitoring and analysing energy usage in construction sites for all projects under construction 

for any abnormality, for immediate rectification 

✓ Implementing various measures to reduce energy consumption, including the consideration of 

energy efficient equipment with the Energy Star logo when purchasing new office equipment 

Using energy efficient lightings and green label photocopiers in the site offices 

 

Soilbuild’s commitment to environmental stewardship is to minimise negative environmental 

impact as well as to constantly educate employees on sustainability aspects. We apply the 

precautionary principle to our environment management to ensure that we minimise any impact 

on the environment and related risks to the organisation. As a growing company, we know our 

footprint is expanding, so we use strategies and practices to gain operational efficiencies, thereby 

reducing energy and water consumption, emissions and waste.  

 

At Soilbuild, employees are sensitised on the issues relating to carbon emissions and are encouraged 

to promote energy and fuel efficiency. We plan to organise interactive activities next year example 

celebrating Earth day and Environment day in order to make our employees aware on broader 

sustainability topics and growing scarcity of natural resources.

Soilbuild has identified energy management as key focus areas towards improving its operational 

efficiency. We will continue to monitor our energy consumption of our construction projects and 

improve on our practices to improve efficiency of energy use. We take the opportunity to upgrade 

or enhance equipment to better energy efficiency levels during major equipment replacement cycle 

or Asset Enhancement Initiative (“AIE”) works at our sites. We will report in subsequent years the 

outcomes of our focused interventions towards energy efficiency.

(b) Water efficiency and management 

 

Most societies and businesses take clean water for granted. At Soilbuild we are concisions of the 

increasing scarcity of water and aim to further strengthen our water management policies. Both water 

quantity and quality are important aspects of water management. From sustaining agriculture and food 

chain, water is required in all industrial plants and commercial operations. Drought conditions which 

are attributable to climate change is already causing acute water shortages in large parts of Asia and in 

the rest of the world. A large percentage of manufacturing and industrial operations which are 

dependent on freshwater are located in water scarce regions such as Southeast Asia and other areas 

where local communities lack access to reliable and affordable drinking water. These regions are also 

most susceptible to climate change impacts on water resources.  We recognise the vital role the provision 

of a sustainable water supply plays in Singapore and Myanmar, which is critical for our own future 

prosperity and development 

 

At Soilbuild we acknowledge the significant operational benefits that arise from a strategic approach to 

water management. At Soilbuild, we are cautious on water consumption and believe water use efficiency 

is beneficial for business as well for environment and society at large. Water savings equipment and 

processes are encouraged across Soilbuild’s operations. Employees are sensitised on the issues relating 

to water scarcity and are advised to reduce water consumption across operations. At Soilbuild, treated 

water is used for multiple purposes such as for cleaning vehicles and other activities. 

 

Table 3 Select water management initiatives at Soilbuild 

 

Water Initiatives 

• 

Monitoring and analysing water usage in construction sites for all projects under construction. 

• 

Using rainwater or recycled water to wash vehicles before they leave the construction sites, and 

using recycled water for washing before casting. Water saving devices like thimbles in taps are 

also installed wherever possible in our project sites and our corporate office. 

 

Total water consumption for Singapore project sites was 116,327 m3 during 2017. In the case of 

Myanmar sites, water was extracted from tube wells, which is allowed within Yangon City Development 

Committee (“YCDC”) legislation for construction project sites with no charges. Hence the measurement 

of water consumption was undeterminable due to lack of data. However, we understand that 

improvement and upgrading of town water supply network in Myanmar is in the progress and YCDC is 

targeting to complete the upgrading of full water supply system by 2019, which by then, we will be able 

to monitor and control our water usage. For our 2018 water targets, we aim to reduce our water 

consumption across the key operational activities using innovative water efficiency and reduction 

measures. We will continue to monitor our water consumption of our construction projects and 

promote water efficiency initiatives.

Social performance: collaborating with our 

employees and wider community 

 

We recognise that our employees are invaluable to the success of our Group. We are 

committed to cultivating a balanced work-life environment for all our employees, as well 

as to developing the new workforce in our industry. 

 

(a) Training and development   

 

In 2017, the Group signed ‘The Pledge for a Better Built Environment Workplace” developed by the 

BCA and Construction Industry Joint Committee in demonstrating the Group’s full support to 

objectives of the pledge to transform the built environment sector into a workplace of choice for our 

local young talents as well as retaining existing talents within the sector. By signing the pledge, we 

are committed to adopt good human resource practices by bringing about more conducive work 

environment and better employee management.   

 

We offer training to assist employees in achieving a higher level of competency and safety standards, 

in order to further enhance the quality of our services and products. Such training also aims to build 

a well-motivated, stable workforce with a high level of team work. A key objective of training is to 

develop competencies which would enable our employees to perform their current or future jobs 

successfully. All our training programmes are geared towards the following objectives: 

 

i. 

strengthening the job skills/ knowledge of employees; 

ii. 

improving operational efficiency and productivity; and 

iii. 

developing and maximising the potential of employees, to the mutual benefit of Soilbuild 

and their own respective selves.

scholarship programme with educational institutions to bring in young and fresh talent into the 

organisation and ensure our current employees meet technical and functional competencies for now 

and future requirements of the Group's business. 

 

 

(c) Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Health and safety at our workplace are of utmost importance to Soilbuild. We manage Quality, 

Environment, Safety and Health effectively by establishing, implementing and maintaining a best 

practice and process oriented integrated management system. 

 

Soilbuild is actively promoting work safety and good environmental awareness by continuously 

upgrading the skills of our employees in order to increase their knowledge and efficiency in 

operational safety supervision and management. Planned events like “Safety Time Out” – an event 

where Company take time off from their routine operations to take stock and review particular work 

activity or system to ensure safe operations, were conducted at construction sites.

Soilbuild has an ongoing campaign Safety Time 

Out (“STO”) which is a planned event and an 

initiative by the Workplace Safety and Health 

(“WSH”) Council where companies take time off 

from their routine operations to take stock and 

review particular work activity or system to ensure 

safe operations.  

During STO, the WSH officer conducts the training 

together with Safety Coordinator and Safety 

Supervisor. Firstly, the WSH officer briefs the 

workers on the reason for carrying a STO. He 

explains the common near miss that were captured 

on LTA site. After which, the WSH officer take 

workers to a walk-way which is mocked up by 

Safety Coordinator to highlight the importance of 

housekeeping. The walk-way is filled all over with 

hazards such as wires, tools and oil (simulated by 

water). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The WSH officer also focuses on the most critical aspect of workers’ behaviour on site. The officer 

educates the workers on safety related accidents arising from wearing worn out Personal Protective 

Equipment (“PPEs”) or not wearing PPEs appropriately. Other topic that get covered during STO 

is on inspection of tools, fire extinguishers &amp; cables for electrical tools. The site supervisor also 

educated workers on good traffic lane closure to ensure safe workers unloading. The key objective 

of this initiative is to increase awareness of the workers on individual hazards and demonstrate the 

consequence of poor housekeeping 

To avoid any near miss cases at worksite 

Soilbuild conducts Safety Time Out STO 

sessions. The objective of STO is to 

improve: 

✓ Workers behaviour on safety aspects 

✓ Increase safety awareness 

✓ Carrying out regular equipment 

inspection  

✓ Ensuring work area is barricaded 

adequately when required 

✓ Ensuring proper housekeeping 

To eliminate any safety related 

occurrences Safety Time Out is carried 

out to educate the workers.

Soilbuild has implemented appropriate procedures and policies to prevent and mitigate the spread 

of communicable diseases for the corporate office and all construction sites. Furthermore, we are 

committed to managing occupational health and safety issues, and preference is given to engaging 

OHSAS 18000-certified or bizSAFE-certified vendors/ contractors for our projects. Soilbuild has 

also been certified by the Workspace Safety and Health Council to have fulfilled the requirements 

to attain bizSAFE Level Star and obtained the OHSAS 18001:2007 certification for the scope of 

building and civil engineering construction services. All workers at Soilbuild need to attend safety 

course.  

 

We pay a lot of emphasise on ensuring that work environment is safe for workers. There have been 

no workplace fatalities during the reporting period. We aim to further strengthen our reporting on 

the key performance indicators relating to occupational health and safety of our employees. We will 

implement compulsory safety induction to educate new staff on the importance of workplace safety 

and risk management procedures. Moreover, we plan to roll out regular safety culture related 

campaigns to advocate and educate our employees on safety related best practices. Our target is to 

achieve accident-free person-hours for all projects that the Company operates in both Singapore 

and Myanmar markets. 

 

 

(d) Fair labour and human rights 

 

We recognise that our employees are invaluable to the success of Soilbuild and we place a high 

value on the contribution of each of our employees and continuously work to meet their needs and 

concerns at workplace. This includes engaging our employees so that they feel a sense of belonging 

to the Group, motivating them to take ownership of their roles and responsibilities, respecting the 

need for work-life integration, and paying attention to their well-being. To advance our 

organisation and to meet challenges in the course of our business, we believe in employing right 

people with the right skill and experience to plan and execute projects competently. Our human 

resource strategy and programme are developed to attract new workforce in our organisation and 

industry and to retain competent employees to enhance productivities in our day-to-day 

operations. We are committed to foster a conducive work environment by adhering to rules, 

regulations and guidelines issued relevant authorities. We adopt fair employment practices, 

respect and uphold human rights principles. In the subsequent years, we intend to organize and 

celebrate events such as International Women’s Day to promote gender inclusivity and equality. 

 

To cultivate a strong sense of job satisfaction amongst our employees and to provide opportunities 

for employees to achieve their full potential, we conduct employee performance review on yearly 

basis. During the performance review, the performance of each employee will be assessed by their 

immediate superior by using a set of key performance indicators based on the core and functional 

competencies. The results of the performance assessment will then be discussed between the 

employee and their immediate superior, whereby the employee’s achievement and their concern, 

area of strength and weakness, training and career advancement plan will be agreed upon and 

documented. The performance assessment will then be submitted to Senior Management for 

endorsement and will be based on in formulating the Group’s human resource planning.

Governance: growth with purpose 

 

In today’s management environment, integrity and ethics have become a demand of the 

times as well as a universal value for all companies. Also, as companies become more 

exposed and vulnerable to risk factors such as technology advancements and recurrence 

of design errors, it is critical that we continue to improve our quality management system 

to remain competitive and to sustain growth.  

 

(a) Service and Product quality and safety 

 

Soilbuild strives for excellence in all aspects of our operations. This includes consistently delivering 

unmatched service and product quality to our customers, and taking a proactive approach to 

managing environment, health and safety practices. Our customers rely on our brands and 

reputation for safe, high quality services / products that they can trust. We use international 

standards to ensure the quality and safety of our services / products. In this section, we will reflect 

on the periodic assessment of the health and safety impacts of services / products. At Soilbuild, we 

seek to effectively identify, assess and treat all quality &amp; safety related risks associated with 

Soilbuild’s business activities, services and products in a responsible manner. 

 

Soilbuild takes pride and places great emphasis on the quality aspects of all projects. We strongly 

believe in delivering high standards of quality and service levels to our customers which are key to 

maintaining customer satisfaction. 

 

Completed Projects in FY 2017 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Soilbuild has established the following quality objectives: 

 

i. 

to comply and continually improve the effectiveness of the quality management system 

which satisfies all requirements of ISO 9001:2015 standard requirements, or any relevant 

statutory and regulatory, customer or other obligations to which the organisation 

subscribes; 

ii. 

to provide total customer satisfaction and encourage repeated patronage by consistently 

exceeding customers’ expectations with reliable quality works; 

iii. 

to deliver projects on time and operate within an allocated budget; and 

iv. 

to constantly provide training to all staff and provide upgrading of work processes to 

improve our work quality procedure so as to improve efficiency and reduce wastage of 

resources. 

 

As an endorsement of our quality management system, Soilbuild has obtained the ISO 9001:2015 

certification for the scope of building and civil engineering construction services. The attainment of 

the above certification will strengthen our customers’ confidence in the quality of our products and 

services and differentiate us from our competitors who have not attained such certification. There 

have been no incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of our products 

and services. Soilbuild’s FY2018 target is to continue to incorporate and improve health and safety 

consideration in our constructions.

(b) Ethics &amp; Anti-corruption 

 

At Soilbuild, our corporate philosophy is to conduct business in a transparent and ethical manner. 

We strongly believe that corruption and fraudulent acts are severe detrimental factors to the 

sustainability of our organisation and society.  In the course of our business, our engagement with 

customers, consultants, sub-contractors, suppliers, business partners and associates, business 

representatives and agents, may expose us to the risk of corruption, fraudulent and unethical 

practises. We have established policies and procedures to prevent such practices. Our policies and 

procedures are communicated to all our employees, customers, consultants, sub-contractors, 

suppliers, business partners and associates, business representatives and agents, as we expect full 

compliance and adherence to our policies and procedures in the business dealings with our Group.  

 

We have established, as part of our human resource management, Employees’ Code of Ethics, which 

sets out the guidelines of acceptable codes of ethics in a workplace. During the reporting period we 

also formalised our Code of Ethics policy. This policy sets out the Code of Ethics’ guidelines which 

also includes dealing with potential areas of conflict of interest between Soilbuild Construction 

Group Ltd.’s employees, associates, vendors, consultants, suppliers and sub-contractors. As part of 

a yearly exercise all staff are required to read and understand the policy and complete the Conflict 

of Interest Declaration form. All employees of the Group are expected to observe integrity and 

professionalism in their course of work by always acting in an honest, fair and ethical manner.  

 

The Group’s Employees’ Code of Ethics includes the following aspects: 

✓ Declaration of potential conflicts at the commence of employment and subsequent yearly 

declaration by all employees 

✓ Managing conflicts when receiving gifts from vendors, consultants, suppliers and sub-

contractors 

✓ Entertainment 

✓ Interested person transaction and business with family and friends 

✓ Financial interest in an outside company 

✓ Fraudulent financial reporting 

✓ Asset misappropriation 

✓ Aiding and abetting 

✓ Insider trading and dealings in securities 

✓ Money laundering 

 

The Group’s Code of Ethics policy covers areas such as Discrimination free and Harassment free 

workplace, Conflict of Interest, Managing Conflicts, Outside Employment, Fraud and Intellectual 

Property. Soilbuild has policy on Ethical Legal Responsibilities - Gift and Entertainment 

Declaration, approved by the Executive Chairman and which came into effect from June 2017. The 

policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees, and other persons working for Soilbuild.  

Types of gifts cover cash or cash equivalent instruments and non-cash gifts with particular 

estimated commercial value. Depending on the type of gifts the necessary procedures and the need 

for declaration form is determined as per the policy.  

The Group has also put in place a whistle-blowing policy to provide employees, vendors, 

consultants, suppliers and sub-contractors with an avenue to raise concerns about possible 

improprieties in financial reporting or other matters, and we believe that arrangements are in place 

for the independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action. A whistle-

blower email address is created for reporting suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or 

other similar matters. Details of the whistle-blowing policies and arrangements have been made 

available to all employees of the Company. All subcontractors will have to sign a Letter of Award 

contracts which whistle blowing policies are attached to. As part of our future initiatives, we will 

review and improve on internal policy on the prevention and management of bribery and corruption 

within Whistle blowing initiative. Our target is to provide training on all ethics and anti-corruption 

related policies and practices to 100% of our employees and ensure the Company meets high levels 

of standards on anti-corruption.
