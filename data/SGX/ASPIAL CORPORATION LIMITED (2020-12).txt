FY2020

Report




CEO’S MESSAGE

I am pleased to present our FY2020 Sustainability Report, which provides the progress and 

achievements of our organisation over the previous 12 months, focusing on our 

commitment to working alongside with our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable 

business.

We believe that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we 

must be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our customers, our people 

and our community as well as our company’s financial performance.

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our ability to remain a strong and 

financially stable company. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to 

the principles laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to the society 

is to ensure that sustainable practices are incorporated into every aspect of our value chain. 

We must meet the needs not only of our customers, employees and the community we 

operate in, but also those of our environment and our future generations.

The Board having considered sustainability issues as part of the Company’s strategic 

formulation, determined the material Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") factors 

and ensured that the management closely monitor them.

2020 was an extraordinary year filled with exceptional challenges that were first of its kind 

with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Society had to conform to new norms and 

safe management measures, which were imposed by governments across the globe to 

control the spread of the pandemic. This greatly impacted the Group’s operations during 

the year. Notwithstanding this, we have managed to adapt effectively to the circumstances, 

and together with various government support, tide through this difficult period.

This report provides details about how we have fulfilled our responsibilities with our key 

stakeholders during the FY2020 and beyond.

Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations

Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and monitoring of its 

carbon footprint can reduce operating costs and pollution. Our 

carbon footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) 

emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of how 

much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG 

emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission that result 

from the electricity used. We have insignificant direct (Scope 1) 

emission, and we do not include the GHG emissions generated by 

our suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, 

we have established our GHG emission efficiency index for 

consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we 

have set a target for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 23% 

from our 2017 level by 2030. Our target for GHG emission 

improvement is 2% per year. Although various business units 

account for different percentages of GHG emissions across the 

organisation, they all support this target and have aligned 

accordingly.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

In FY2020, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 7.60. In 

comparison to base year FY2017, it is a 8% increase. The increase of 

index was mainly due to the significant drop in revenue. We will 

continue to strive for further improvements towards our 2030 goals.

For more details on the GHG emission efficiency index,

please refer to page 21 of the Sustainability Report. 11

Reduction of Paper Consumption

All our employees are urged to minimise paper usage at work by 

adhering to our paperless initiative. We encourage all employees to 

adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to 

further reduce paper consumption.

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, 

we established our paper consumption index for consistent tracking 

of paper consumption over time. Due to the successful implementation 

of our paperless initiative, we recorded a significant improvement in our 

paper consumption since FY2018. Hence, we had revised our paper 

consumption improvement target from 23% to 40% by 2030. There is a 

further cut down of paper consumption during the COVID-19 outbreak 

as more digitalisation process was implemented  to enhance the 

effectiveness of work-from-home arrangement. We would like to revise 

our paper consumption improvement target from 40% to 55% by 

2030.  Our target for paper consumption improvement is about 1% per 

year. Although various business units account for different percentages 

of paper consumption across the organisation, they all support this 

target and have aligned accordingly.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

In FY2020, we consumed total of 1,628 kg of paper, 100% of which 

are either Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified, Programme 

for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) certified or 

ecological responsibility.

Our Paper consumption index stands at 23.71. In comparison 

to our base year FY2017, it is a 49% improvement. 12

Aspial Corporation Limited | Sustainability Report FY2020




Caring for Our Employees

Our Approach

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their 

professional development is vital to our business sustainability. Our 

goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, which are in 

line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the 

foundation upon which we build all our business initiatives and 

conduct our day-to-day activities.

Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and policies 

have been developed and established based on fair employment 

practices with the goal of attracting, developing and retaining a 

motivated workforce.

In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we protect the health 

and safety of our employees by allowing them to return to the office 

on a team rotation basis and encourage them to continue working 

from home, where possible.

Employment Practices

Our employment practices focus on maximising the strength of our employees by providing equal opportunities based on merits 

and helping our employees to develop strength through our comprehensive training and development programme.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Aspial Corporation Limited | Sustainability Report FY2020

Communications

As our Company grows, effective communications across the 

organisation are crucial to ensure continuous alignment of 

objectives of the employees and the organisational objectives. We 

achieve this through our various communication sessions 

customised based on the target employees. Communication 

sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis.

Agendas covered at these sessions are customised appropriate to 

the target functional scope of the managers.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, regular communications on COVID-

19 related information was provided to all employees through email 

or other internal communication.

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices 

We adopt best practices in HR management. 

Our HR practices are guided by the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for 

Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore Tripartite 

Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National 

Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress.

Employee Feedback

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks are important in the improvement of 

overall management and operation of the organisation. Through various established processes of employee engagement, such as 

employee objective setting, performance review as well as exit interview in case of resignations, we gather such valuable feedbacks 

for the continuous improvement of our organisation.

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as whistle-blowing policy on control 

and compliance issues.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Aspial Corporation Limited | Sustainability Report FY2020




Career Development and Training

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is 

critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, productive 

and motivated workforce.

In FY2020, each employee received an average of 18.2 

hours of training. We recognised that the training 

requirements vary depending on the levels of 

management responsibilities. Each senior management 

registered an average of 3.8 hours of training, while 

managerial and non-managerial staff received an 

average of 49.7 hours and 16.9 hours of training 

respectively. In light of changing business requirements 

and opportunities in variety of training methodologies, 

we continue to revise our training curriculum and 

programme to align with the organisation objectives 

and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our 

training approach.

Employee Benefits

To ensure our workforce is well taken-care off, our 

employees in Singapore are provided with the statutory 

benefits as well as market-competitive non-statutory 

benefits. 

Workforce Diversity

In FY2020, 110 of our employees were males, comprising 

37% of our workforce, while 189 (63%) employees were 

females. In terms of management function, 25 males 

(38%) held managerial positions compared to 41 females 

(62%), while 73 males (34%) and 143 females (66%) held 

non-managerial positions. The male to female ratio of 

managerial and non-managerial positions were 25:41 and 

73:143 respectively.

Safety and Health in the Workplace

We are committed to workplace safety and health, and we take precautions to prevent occupational 

injuries among our employees. We believe that safe workplace conditions boost work morale.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, our company reacted quickly by sending down surgical masks and 

sanitisers to the retail outlets. We have representatives from each department in the Safe Management 

Committee to conduct inspections and checks, and remedy non-compliance, and assist in reinforcing and 

ensuring understanding of the internal communications on safe management measures.

Retirement and Healthcare

Our company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and 

regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with 

applicable laws and regulations in those countries we operate. We provide medical coverage for 

employees.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Individual Rights

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations.

In FY2020, none of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of forced 

labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human rights-related 

grievances have been reported.

Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

Our Approach

Safety in our premises is always our 

priority.

Product Quality and Safety

Reliability and quality of our products are important to us. We have in place a set of key quality assurance 

processes to ensure compliance with international standards. For example, the quality of diamond used 

in our products is subject to stringent external assurance processes such as diamond grading by American 

GEM Society Laboratories (AGS), Forevermark (FM), as well as Gemological Institute of America (GIA) on 

diamond grading which represents a technologically advanced diamond and gemstone evaluation and 

provides a blueprint of the gemstone’s attributes and a tangible record of its quality.

Data Safety and Privacy

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have well established Personal Data Protection

Act (“PDPA”) Policy to protect the privacy of such sensitive data.

Partnering Our Suppliers

Our Approach

We strive to encourage our suppliers to adopt sustainable 

business practice.

Supplier Selection

We select our key suppliers based on criteria such as 

quality of products and services, competitiveness of 

pricing and financial health. 

We will require our suppliers to disclose their sustainable 

business practice. Although sustainable business practice 

is not the only criterion, it is one of the key criteria in our 

supplier selection.

Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions as measure in GHG 

emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and kilowatt 

Hours (kWh), from electricity and fuel consumed. We 

purchased electricity from local electric retailers.

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG 

emissions and electricity consumption vary. To ensure 

consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and 

electricity consumption measures over time, we create 

a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index 

for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the 

GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size 

of our activities. We normalise the amount of GHG 

emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of 

our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our 

activities. The GHG emission index is measured in t-CO2

per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is 

measured in kWh per SGD million.

As of FY2020, the GHG Emission Index stands at 7.60 and Electricity 

Consumption Index stands at 16,085.09, which is 8% increase when 

compared with base year FY2017. We normalise the amount of GHG 

emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our revenues which 

we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. Thus, the drop of revenue in 

FY2020 had caused a significant impact on the index. However, we 

will continue to strive for further improvements towards our 2030 goals.

Aspial Corporation Limited | Sustainability Report FY2020


Paper Consumption

We capture the data for paper consumption by 

number of reams of paper used where one ream 

is equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure 

consistency and comparability across various 

paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we 

measure the paper consumption by the weight of 

paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes 

and quality of papers.

Our business and function grow over time and 

the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise 

a paper consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the paper 

consumption for the size of our activities. We 

normalize the amount of weights of paper 

consumed by the amount of our revenues which 

we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The 

paper consumption index is measured in 

kilograms per SGD million.
