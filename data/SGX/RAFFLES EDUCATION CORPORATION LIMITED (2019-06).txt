BOARD’S STATEMENT 

 

In the face of a changing climate and a changing world, educational institutions play an important role as 

innovators and leaders in sustainability.  

 

As the Board of Directors, we recognise the importance of sustainability and seek to contribute to our 

environment and society through our role as education provider and responsible corporate citizen. 

 

To achieve our aim of having a productive relationship with our learners and to link education to the way people 

aspire to live and work every day, we are focused on three priorities: growing market share through our digital 

transformation; investing in growing market opportunities; and becoming a simpler, more efficient, and 

sustainable company. 

 

Whether it’s offering qualifications that help people get better jobs or providing products and services for 

learners who are struggling, our Sustainability Plan drives us to improve quality access to education, innovate in 

new ways, and reduce our environmental footprint. Sustainability is important to our company and to our 

stakeholders. Learners and educators expect our business to help improve access through our products and 

services. Our employees seek purpose in their jobs, and working toward sustainability objectives can help them 

find it. And our investors are increasingly interested in matters relating to environmental, social, and governance 

(ESG) criteria. 

 

Furthermore, Higher Education Institutions have a pivotal role in disseminating and mainstreaming sustainability 

thinking within society. We aim at making our students (i.e., future managers, leaders, politicians and 

academics) capable of dealing with a large range of global and interlinked economic, environmental, and social 

issues in their future professional and personal lives.  

 

Being green is no longer a cost of doing business; it is a catalyst for innovation, new market opportunity, and 

wealth creation. In a new green world, managers might redesign a product so that it uses fewer environmentally 

harmful or resource-depleting raw materials - an effort that if successful could result in cuts in direct 

manufacturing costs and inventory savings. 

 

Raffles Education operate a network of design schools spread across many parts of the world. We aspire to and 

are working at devising farsighted and innovative teaching curriculum, creative solutions to address the 

environmental challenge. We intend to make sustainable development part of our higher education culture, and 

on ensuring the institutionalization of sustainable development in our Higher Education Institutions.  

 

Present day business planning must take into consideration the power of unknown and unexpected 

externalities. It calls for the kind of management thinking that doesn’t depend on charting known facts against 

other known facts. We must be willing to think high and wide.  

 

We intend to incorporate the environment into our corporate strategic planning by taking the following 

measures:  

 

1.  Understand the critical environmental threats. 

2.  Determine how the company’s activities contribute to them. 

3.  Implement a remedial program wherever pollution prevention pays. 

4.  Aim research to develop teaching methodologies to produce more environmentally benign   processes and 

products. 

5.  Consider all new investments with environmental effects in mind. 

 

Our Sustainability Plan serves to drive our commitment to integrating social and environmental issues into every 

aspect of our business.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

 

We have carried out our first materiality analysis 

on environmental, social and governance in 2018 

to identify sustainability-related topics that are 

important 

to 

RafflesEducation 

and 

our 

stakeholders. These were subsequently reviewed 

in 2019.  

 

The   material   ESG   factors   were   identified    

and  ranked  based   on   significance   topics    to  

RafflesEducation 

and 

our 

valued 

key 

stakeholders. 

 

We are still in the process of understanding our 

baseline where the collection of quantitative 

data is required for reporting in line with the GRI 

standards and as such, we will continue to 

report on our performance in next subsequent

GOVERNANCE 

 

GOVERNANCE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR GOOD 

 

At RafflesEducation, corporate governance goes 

beyond regulations and compliance. We viewed 

it as a foundation for sustained competitive 

advantage that strengthens our business as well 

as management of sustainability related risks. 

 

Our corporate governance framework consists of 

policies and control systems which provides us 

with guiding principles on business conduct and  

ethics 

to 

all 

our 

board 

members 

and 

stakeholders. 

 

Our 

corporate 

governance 

structure 

and 

practices are set out in our Annual Report on 

page 41 – 58. Strong corporate governance 

underscores is our commitment to integrity, 

reliability and transparency in the management 

of our company.  

 

 

ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY AND GOVERNANCE 

 

We firmly believe that better business performance and our success are earned through transparency, 

honesty and keeping our promises. Therefore, RafflesEducation holds employees and business partners 

to high governance, ethical and compliance standards. A strong culture of integrity drives better 

business results and is essential to our success.

corruption in our operations or on our behalf and 

is 

committed

maintaining 

an

GOVERNANCE 

 

 

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION  

 

The Group recognizes that personal data 

collection and analysis have become widespread 

with the rapid developments in technology. 

 

As part of our control measures, a Personal Data 

Protection (“PDP”) policy is set forth to protect 

the integrity of the stakeholders’ personal data 

from inappropriate or unathorised use.  

 

With our extensive range of policies and 

procedures, the Group seeks to enhance its’ 

corporate 

framework 

with 

continual 

risk 

assessment and management of internal controls 

to perform and operate in the advancing 

business development. 

 

 

 

 

RISK MANAGEMENT  

 

Risk Management is an integral part of 

RafflesEducation’s business activities both at 

strategic and operational levels. Through pro-

active risk management which supports the 

achievement of the Group’s business objectives 

and execution of corporate strategy in core 

markets, value is created and preserved. 

 

The Group Risk Management Committee 

sets a corporate-wide approach to non-

compliance procedures to investigate and 

follow up on any non-compliance identified 

as well as reporting the number of 

substantiated 

claims 

or 

incidents 

of 

noncompliance. 

 

CYBERSECURITY AND DATA GOVERNANCE 

 

We manage cybersecurity challenges through a 

stringent series of codes, policies and security 

controls. Customer data is protected from 

intrusions and unauthorised access. Employees 

are subjected to the strictest standards of 

privacy and confidentiality. 

 

We take this challenge seriously and have

WASTE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 

 

In 

today’s 

era 

of 

increasing 

sustainable  

development efforts, stakeholders are becoming 

more socially and environmentally conscious. At 

RafflesEducation, we recognize the corporate 

responsibility to increase the standards of living 

while 

preserving 

the 

profitability 

of 

the 

organization. 

 

In our journey towards greener surrounding, we 

endeavor to make use of environmentally 

friendly materials and promotes conservation of 

non-renewable 

resources 

and 

reduce 

our 

environmental impacts. 

 

We integrate our environmental efforts into our 

business    operations.     Our       environmental 

initiatives aid in gaining competitive advantage  

 

 

 

against other market players and in building 

trust with our valued stakeholders. 

 

The Group conducts proper disposal of material 

waste 

in 

all 

subsidiaries 

through 

the 

engagement of licensed scrap contractors in our 

bid to build a sustainable environment.  

 

Furthermore, we intend to incorporate this 

sustainable 

development 

culture 

into 

the 

building plans and construction methods of all 

our future international schools and institutions 

of learning.  

 

We are in the process of obtaining certification 

for ISO 14001:2015 and strive to maintain 

compliance with the applicable environment 

rules and regulations standards.

HUMAN CAPITAL 

 

Our business is extremely people-centric, and 

therefore 

the 

ability 

to 

attract, 

develop, 

motivate, and retain talent is critical to our 

sustainability. At a time of profound and rapid 

technology change, the Group’s HR strategy is 

focused on providing our global, diverse 

workforce with a stimulating environment that is 

flexible, 

nurtures 

social 

contract, 

fosters 

innovation, builds a result-oriented, 

high-

performance culture, and motivates today’s 

multi-generational and mobile workforce to 

develop itself personally and professionally. 

 

Our employee-friendly workplace and HR 

policies have resulted in consistently a strong 

employer brand. 

 

We have a highly educated workforce whose 

skills are greatly valued globally. The total 

number of employees as on 30 June 2019 was

At RafflesEducation, every employee is valued and 

respected, irrespective of gender, ethnic or religious

other personal characteristics. These principles are 

laid down in the Group’s mandatory minimum 

employment standards, which apply globally and 

across all of its locations. In the reporting period, 

RafflesEducation

the Group seeks to fill an increasing number of 

Group management positions with international 

candidates.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

 

 

Fair employment practices create an inclusive 

workplace culture. While both development tools 

can be utilized independently and accordingly, the 

two tools are connected. Continuing education 

trainings compliment performance evaluations by 

establishing an active communication channel 

between employer and employees. Employee 

gatherings strengthen bonds and builds a strong 

working relationship between employees for an 

efficient workplace synergy. 

 

The 

Group 

conducts 

annual 

performance 

appraisals for all employees to validate their merit 

performance to complete job tasks. Objective 

evaluations aid in the recognition of employees’ 

competency 

and 

gaps, 

potentially 

allowing 

adjustments to the training program.

STAFF ENGAGEMENT 

 

RafflesEducation 

encourages 

open 

communication and positive employee bonding to 

create a happy work environment that boasts 

productivity.  

 

At RafflesEducation, we practise an open-door 

policy where we allow all employees to obtain fair 

review and a prompt response to problems or 

concerns relating to any aspect of work. This 

includes   harassment,  handling  of  grievances 

and whistleblowing  policies that  are  applicable     

to all employees. Most of our schools and 

colleges publish an e-magazine to provide 

weekly and monthly updates on the latest 

developments within each school and colleges.  

 

Information 

such 

as 

employment 

terms, 

benefits and practices, ethics and code of 

business conduct is made available to the 

employees through the Company’s intranet 

portal. 

 

 

POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT 

 

RafflesEducation  recognizes  that  a  positive  

work environment  is  essential  to  attract,  

motivate  and  retain  talents. A  total  well-being 

programme has been put in place to promote 

personal development, health and work life 

harmony.  Initiatives include a comprehensive 

medical benefits plan, flexible work  arrangement, 

employee engagement initiatives, etc.  

 

Under the leadership of the Group’s Chairman 

and CEO, Mr. Chew Hua Seng, the Group will 

continue to build on its strong foundation and 

strive to continue to be a premier education 

provider.

or harassment in the workplace. 

 

Any non-compliance incidents can be reported to 

Group HR and can be subjected to disciplinary 

action. Our standards for labour standards are 

communicated to all employees. Our talent 

policies and initiatives are aimed at strengthening

RafflesEducation  is committed  to  and  strongly  

supports a policy   that allows   employees  to  

work in an environment free from any 

unwelcomed harassment or abuse by fellow 

employees or others.  

 

We view sexual harassment as a serious 

misconduct that undermines the integrity and 

respect 

of 

the 

working 

relationship 

of 

employees 

in 

the 

workplace. 

Sexual 

harassment is also regarded as a serious 

violation of the Company’s Rules and Code of 

Conduct and the Company will not hesitate to 

report such violations or misconduct to the 

police.

COMMITMENT TOWARDS A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE 

 

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) are of utmost importance to RafflesEducation.  

We are committed to having a safe and healthy learning environment and workplace for all and are 

in the midst of drawing up a framework towards OHS that will include identifying material issues, 

setting of policies, and ensuring accountability within the Company.  

 

STUDENT CENTRIC 

 

When our students expect quality education and 

good experiences, we at RafflesEducation focus 

on understanding our students and putting them 

first in everything we do. 

 

We strive to understand what they are seeking 

and continuously improve the quality of our 

courses to meet their needs and expectations. We 

use a combination on internal and external 

measurements to assess how we are doing and to 

improve the quality of our product services.  

 

We have conducted our Student Satisfaction 

Surveys in 2018 and 2019 for services rendered 

that cover the area of facilities and environment, 

teaching- learning resources, student support 

services, student grievances, general satisfaction 

and overall satisfaction rates.  



 

 

The benchmark for each area is 75% out of a total score percentage. 

 

Key Results based on surveys conducted 

 

RafflesEducation has achieved its target set and has improved the scores in all categories as  

we strive to deliver high quality of customer services and experience to all our students. 

 

The top 3 feedbacks based on the highest satisfaction scores provided were: 

 

1) General Satisfaction 

2) Student Grievances 

3) Teaching – Learning Resources
