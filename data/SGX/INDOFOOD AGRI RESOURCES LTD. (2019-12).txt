Our Policy

Our Sustainable Agriculture Policy (“Policy”) 

guides all our sustainability programmes. It 

applies to all our operations, including our plasma 

smallholders and third-party suppliers from 

whom we purchase for our factories. Key Policy 

commitments to deliver sustainably produced 

products are:

• No deforestation; conservation of High 

Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon 

Stock (HCS) areas

• No planting on peat regardless of depth

• No burning

• Respect for Labour and Human Rights, 

including Freedom of Association and  

non-discrimination

• Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).

About IndoAgri, Our Vision,  

Mission and Values

Indofood Agri Resources Ltd (“IndoAgri”) is 

listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) with 

headquarter in Singapore. IndoAgri and its 

subsidiaries operate plantation and processing 

facilities to produce palm oil, rubber, sugar, 

cocoa and tea. The group also operates research &amp; 

development, seed breeding, manufacturing and 

marketing of award-winning edible oils brands.

Our vision is to become a leading integrated 

agribusiness 

and 

a 

world-class 

agricultural 

research and seed breeding company. Our mission 

drives us: to be a high-yield, low-cost producer that 

continuously improves its people, processes and 

technology to deliver at the highest standards of 

quality. Our values guide our work: with discipline 

as the basis of our way of life, we conduct our 

business with integrity, we treat our stakeholders 

with respect, and together we unite to strive for 

excellence and continuous innovation.


Although 83% of our plantations are used to grow oil palm, 

we recognise that sustainability impacts are associated with 

all our crops. In 2019, we started to report on our rubber 

operations as part of IndoAgri’s commitment to improve 

group level sustainability performance. We report various 

data this year on energy, water, and waste. We also continue 

to expand our Bonsucro sugar certification in our sugar 

operations in Brazil.

 

In 2019, we also further examined our exposure to climate 

change risk and opportunity. We recognise the potential 

effects of a changing climate on agribusinesses, and our 

Board is fully aware of the physical and transition risks 

and opportunities facing IndoAgri. Our work in this area is 

informed by international frameworks, designed to address 

corporate value at risk, and to meet the expectations of 

stakeholders, such as investors. We will expand on this area 

in future reports.

Our Board has overall responsibility for sustainability issues, 

validates material environment, social and governance (ESG) 

topics and oversees their management and monitoring. In 

2019 we also began to align how our performance on material 

sustainability topics contributes to achieving the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs). Our community investments help 

achieved this: in 2019, we continued funding cleft lip surgery 

and Community Health Centres (locally known as ‘Posyandu’), 

amongst many other community programmes. 

Responsibility, accountability, and alignment with societal 

expectations are important at IndoAgri. We look forward 

to further refining our approach to sustainability risk and 

opportunity, and to positively contributing to the lives of 

our employees, communities, smallholders, suppliers, civil 

society organisations, customers and investors in 2020. I 

would invite you to read the two employee testimonials on 

the following pages as a precursor to the details on policies, 

management, and performance data found in the Report. 

One relates to Mr Adi Sumantri, who started work with us 

as a seasonal worker, and is now an Assistant Manager of 

Training &amp; Total Quality Management. The other relates 

to Ms Herani who joined us as a field nursery supervisor, 

and was promoted to become an Estate Manager in 2016, 

a remarkable achievement in what has historically been a 

male-dominated position. These are just two stories of many, 

demonstrating how IndoAgri proactively trains and promotes 

employees from all levels, giving them opportunities to 

develop their careers with us.

CEO STATEMENT

WELCOME TO OUR EIGHTH ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT 

OF 

PERFORMANCE 

ON 

RELEVANT 

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE TOPICS. 

ITS CONTENT IS SHAPED BY A FORMAL MATERIALITY 

PROCESS, INFORMED BY OUR ENTERPRISE RISK 

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, AND REVIEWED BY THE 

INDOAGRI BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

In my 2018 CEO Statement, I described our heritage in the 

industry, and our long-standing expertise and management 

experience as we work to deliver our vision and mission. 

As sustainability evolves, so do we. We continue to adapt to 

these emerging challenges, whilst finding opportunity through 

innovation in our operations. In 2019, we again pushed the 

process of continuous improvement forward. 

We reflect on our top priority: the health and safety of our 

workers. Each year, we conduct a detailed review of the cause 

of any safety incident. In 2018, we removed palm trees near 

powerlines to mitigate this safety risk, and we improved our 

processes for near-miss reporting. In 2019, we continued 

our review and improved safety in spraying activities, one of 

many areas of continuous improvement. While we endured 

fewer fatalities across our operations compared to 2018, we 

regret to report two fatalities in 2019, both in our palm oil 

operations. We are supporting the families and colleagues 

affected. We are investigating each one thoroughly, with 

corrective action and risk mitigation measures to follow. A 

priority goal for us is zero fatalities. We remain committed 

to it: in the Board room we question our safety management 

approaches, and evolve our teams to ensure the right skills 

are devoted to safety programmes across our operations. 

Along with our stakeholders, we hold ourselves accountable 

for sustainability impacts, as well as for commercial results. 

Our target is to ensure that 100% of crude palm oil (CPO) we 

refine is sourced in accordance with our Policy by the end of 

2020. By the end of 2019, 80% of our plantation hectarage 

was ISPO certified (2018: 79%). We have extended our 

target of achieving 100% ISPO certification to 2023 due 

to new areas under development. Our programmes on 

sustainable agriculture, workforce conditions, smallholders, 

and traceability have all supported the delivery of mandatory 

ISPO certification.

On labour practices, we continue to ensure continuous 

improvement in line with international standards, and we 

engage with stakeholders to resolve any challenges that 

arise. In response to a formal complaint from 2016, we 

commissioned an independent legal review at the relevant 

locations in North Sumatra. The review, by an Indonesian 

legal firm, concluded that the allegations were unfounded 

and that we fully complied with the labour laws of the 

Government of Indonesia. Whilst we have always been clear 

on our compliance, given the serious nature of the allegations 

we felt it important to demonstrate this to our stakeholders 

by engaging external legal experts to conduct a review; their 

report is published in full on our website.

“I first started working at IndoAgri when I was 21 years 

old. I started off at the Bah Lias Research Station at 

the Terawas Indah Estate, South Sumatra as a seasonal 

worker and one year later I became a permanent employee 

as a Crop Protection Supervisor. I was later assigned in 

the Human Resources Department and in 2016, I was 

promoted to my current position as the Assistant Manager 

of Training &amp; Total Quality Management (TQM). 

Working at IndoAgri has been a source 

of pride for my family and I, because it 

represents acceptance and social mobility 

where I was able to advance from the 

lowest level to my current position.

I benefit from a good income, welfare and pension 

benefits, personal development and career progression. 

I have attended various training seminars on plantation 

agronomy and management, that allow me to contribute 

to continuous improvement. I am thankful that IndoAgri 

pays attention to workers’ career development.”

“This year marks my 24th year of working at IndoAgri. I 

started off as a Nursery Supervisor. In 2000, I passed the 

staff selection and training to become a Field Assistant 

at the Sei Lakitan Estate. After a series of promotions, 

I was appointed as Estate Manager, which has been my 

role for the past four years. 

I feel grateful to have a career and to have reached 

my current position. When I first joined IndoAgri, as a 

female, I had never dreamed of becoming a manager in 

the plantation industry. 

I am thankful for the trust and guidance 

that the IndoAgri leaders have provided to 

me. My experience proves that at IndoAgri, 

everyone is given the same rights and 

opportunities. My long career here has instilled  

in me a sense of love and belonging at IndoAgri that  

has helped me overcome many obstacles.”

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT

A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

Our approach to sustainability is supported by our Vision, 

Mission, Values, Code and Policies that commit us to 

responsible business practices and the highest standards 

of quality and conduct. Our management approach and 

six programmes show how we manage the risks and 

opportunities of our material topics, as detailed on page 

7. They translate into action in the form of management 

systems and standard operational procedures (SOPs), 

certifications, external engagement, internal collaboration, 

R&amp;D, and training. We use an SAP enterprise data and 

sustainability information system to assess progress against 

targets. We continuously review and update our approach to 

align with emerging topics and global developments. 

GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY 

We apply the precautionary principle in managing  

our material ESG topics; we are committed to preventing 

undesirable impacts, for which we hold ourselves 

accountable, and we seek alternatives in a risk-based 

manner, as appropriate. Our Board oversees the management 

and monitoring of our material ESG topics. At our quarterly 

Board Meetings, senior leaders of our Sustainability Think 

Tank, led by the CEO, report on sustainability performance, 

provide updates on recent sustainability developments, and 

share decisions made in response to these developments. 

Our Audit and Risk Management Committee receives a 

quarterly update on material sustainability risks and related 

concerns.

The Sustainability Think Tank comprises Executive Directors, 

Chief Operating Officers, the Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) unit, the R&amp;D team, and sustainability representatives 

from each business unit. Prior to writing the Sustainability 

Report every year, the Sustainability Think Tank conducts 

a review of IndoAgri’s material topics, accounting for the 

UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Of all the  

17 SDGs we have identified 13 of particular relevance 

to us, to which we can contribute through our Policy and 

programmes, see page 7. 

Our sustainability performance is evaluated using progress 

against targets, see page 11. ISPO certification for our 

oil palm operations and the Indonesian Government’s 

Programme for Pollution Control, Evaluation, and Rating 

(PROPER) environmental initiative help us to deliver 

performance on governance, no deforestation, land rights, 

no new planting on peatland, no burning, smallholders, 

and human rights. We review our evaluation methods 

based on internal and external audits, performance trends, 

and stakeholder feedback. Our regular internal audits, 

monitoring, and assessments are guided by the ISO 14001 

Environment Management Systems and the ISO 9001 

Quality Management Systems. 

We are committed to ethical conduct and are against 

corruption. All new employees receive induction training on 

our Code of Conduct, including anti-corruption.

Focus on key sustainability topics

In this section, we outline the relevance of each material topic, where impacts occur, and how we manage them.  

The management approach (MA) of our material topics, which covers all of IndoAgri’s crops, serves to establish processes to 

achieve measurable improvement, guided by targets. Components of the MA include Sustainability Programmes, policies, 

standards, and certifications such as ISPO, PROPER, and ISO 14001. 

All our material topics are managed under a set of six Sustainability Programmes. The components of our MA form the basis of 

monitoring, evaluating, and improving performance on each material topic. This entire set of activities must comply with our Policy.

patterns may further disrupt the industry’s traditional 

models and crop yields. A growing global population 

and increases in urbanisation and disposable incomes 

lead to greater consumption of agricultural products. 

In the face of climate and socio-economic ‘disruptors’, 

agribusinesses must innovate to address changing needs 

and demands. Our business model adapts, allowing for 

new technologies and techniques, new investments in 

climate-resilient crops, technical expertise, and new 

ways of working in rural communities under our Work  

and Estate Living Programme.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

Transparency in the supply chain and responsible sourcing 

practices are increasingly important to customers as their 

own operations and procurement come under scrutiny. 

Commercial success depends on our customers having 

confidence in our products and their origins. We are 

committed to excellence in supply chain relations to 

encourage transparent, responsible, and profitable practices. 

This improves resilience in the agribusiness industry and 

its communities against economic and social hardship, and 

outcomes of political decisions. 

ISPO certification is a key component in delivering on 

our Policy and commitments. It is a certification system 

developed and mandated by the Indonesian Government. 

To establish the traceability of each tonne of palm oil,  

we record the following: 

• Name, parent company, address and 

GeoCoordinates  of plantation2 and mill

• Nucleus or plasma KUD/kelompok profile  

and data

• Refinery dispatch number

• Certification status

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

Our approach on key sustainability

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

We are committed to minimising negative impacts on 

the environment and to consuming resources responsibly 

throughout 

our 

value 

chain. 

We 

regularly 

evaluate 

environmental risks and the value of ecosystems. Our 

Sustainable Agriculture Policy demonstrates our commitment 

to high standards on material topic impacts in supplier 

operations too; environmental protection can only be achieved 

with cooperation across the value chain. Impacts under 

management arise from climate change, land management, 

biodiversity loss, and fire risk. Our ERM framework and 

whistle-blowing mechanisms help to ensure compliance 

with relevant environmental regulations, and to mitigate the 

associated risks.

IndoAgri is aware of the potential risks and opportunities 

that climate change may pose for the ecosystems, 

communities, 

and 

the 

agribusiness 

supply 

chain. 

Environmental challenges which may arise from climate 

change such as water scarcity and unpredictable weather

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

PEOPLE

The well-being and development of our workers is fundamental 

to our success. Our Policy outlines our commitment to 

respect and protect the rights of our workers, comply with 

the Indonesian law as well as the UN Universal Declaration 

on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation 

(ILO) codes of practice ratified by the Republic of Indonesia3. 

We aim to provide our workers with stable incomes, safe 

working environments, and improved job opportunities. We 

take strict, actionable measures to ensure no forced labour 

or child labour on any of our sites.

All IndoAgri employees are paid above the minimum wage 

of their respective regions, which are determined by regional 

governments , taking into account the sector, cost of living in 

each province, and collective labour agreement in that region. 

We also provide all permanent employees and their families 

with additional free benefits such as housing, healthcare 

and education to ensure a decent living wage. We support 

employees’ rights to collective bargaining. Employees are 

free to register themselves with their preferred labour union.

We are committed to providing safe workplaces for our 

thousands of employees across Indonesia. We have a rigorous 

OHS management system in place to minimise negative health 

impacts and prevent accidents. All our sites are equipped 

with SMK3 (Indonesian OHS standard) management systems 

and undergo SMK3 refresher trainings every year to ensure 

day-to-day compliance across all sites. In addition, workers 

are reminded of safety standard operating procedures before 

they start work every morning. 

We encourage professional development and the upskilling of  

our workforce through Training and Development programmes. 

This provides career progression opportunities for our 

employees and meets our needs for skilled, capable human 

resources.

2. Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98);

3. Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29);

4. Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105);

5. Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138);

6. Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182);

7. Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100);

8. Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111).

COMMUNITY RELATIONS

We comply with Indonesian law and our business operations 

align with the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights, 

and the International Labour Organisation codes of practice, 

as ratified by the Republic of Indonesia. In addition to this 

we are committed to respecting the FPIC rights of indigenous 

people whenever our operations impact them.

As one of the biggest agribusinesses in rural Indonesia, we 

recognise our ability to positively impact the lives of those 

living in and surrounding our operations. We aim to empower 

local communities and, through our business, to improve 

their quality of life. Our Work and Estate Living Programme 

ensures that needs of the community and local governments 

are met through economic development.

PRODUCT SAFETY, PRODUCT QUALITY

Due to its versatility, palm oil is used extensively across 

many edible and non-edible products. As such, product 

quality and safety are crucial to our commercial success. 

Our Quality Policy and Sustainable Agriculture Policy hold 

us to high standards of product quality, process safety, as 

well as the implementation of food safety management 

systems and quality assurance at our refineries. We also 

provide certification to local and international food safety 

standards such as Indonesia National Standard (SNI) and 

FSSC 22000. 

Customers want full product traceability while regulators 

want complete information on ingredients and nutritional 

content. We provide many channels of communication 

to meet the needs, complemented by compliance with 

regulations on food safety, consumer protection, quality and 

nutrition, labelling, and advertising.  We use independent 

market-testing and accredited laboratories to meet health, 

safety and regulatory standards. All CPO supplied to 

us is traceable to its milling site via batch coding. Our 

products and refineries are certified by an approved 

Halal certification system, LPPOM MUI, The Assessment 

Institute for Foods, Drugs And Cosmetics, the Indonesian 

Council of Ulama.

OIL PALM: OUR PRINCIPAL CROP

OIL PALM: OUR PRINCIPAL CROP

Our oil palm seeds are produced using world renowned 

breeding populations from Southeast Asia and Africa. We 

meet the evolving needs of our customers and stakeholders 

through our two state-of-the-art seed breeding R&amp;D centres: 

PT Sumatra Bioscience (Sumbio) in North Sumatra and PT 

Sarana Inti Pratama (SAIN) in Pekanbaru. They produce 

high-yielding seed material, free of Genetically Modified 

Organisms, which attract a premium on the open market.

As of 31 December 2019, we managed 251,819 hectares of 

total planted oil palm estates, of which 16% were immature 

estates. The average age of our oil palm trees is 16 years, of 

which 17% is under seven years old, a key attribute for our 

future CPO production.

In 2019, we produced 4,148,000 tonnes of FFB from our 

nucleus estates, plasma, and third parties. These FFB were 

milled into 840,000 tonnes of CPO.

A new mill with a capacity to process 45 tonnes of FFB per 

hour was commissioned in Central Kalimantan in September 

2019, increasing our total FFB processing capacity to 7.0 

million tonnes.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

RUBBER

We also operate rubber operations in North and  

South Sumatra, East Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. As of  

31 December 2019, we managed 16,796 hectares of rubber 

estates. In 2019, we produced 8,200 tonnes of sheet or 

cup lump rubber. Around 53% of our rubber produced is 

exported to Singapore, the US, and UK.

OUR OTHER CROPS

Through joint ventures and other investments, we operate 

sugar operations in Indonesia, Brazil, and the Philippines. 

In 2019, our sugar joint venture CMAA produced 298,000 

tonnes of raw sugar, 321,000 m3 of ethanol and 322,000 

MWh of electricity for export and domestic markets.  CMAA 

achieved Bonsucro certification for 1,005,000 tonnes of 

sugar cane harvested from 13,456 hectares. This represents 

100% of area available for certification.

OUR EDIBLE OIL PRODUCTS

More than 80% of our branded edible oil and fats are sold in 

the Indonesian market. The remainder is exported.

In Indonesia, our cooking oils are sold under the leading 

brands Bimoli, Bimoli Spesial, Delima, and Happy. Our 

consumer margarine and shortening are marketed under 

the Palmia, Royal Palmia and Amanda brands, while their 

industrial equivalents are branded Palmia, Simas, Amanda, 

Malinda, and Delima.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019


Forest Protection

WE RECORDED ZERO PRIMARY FOREST CLEARANCE 

AND DEGRADATION OF HCV AREAS IN 2019.

All operations are guided by our Sustainable Agriculture 

Policy. We are strongly committed to the preservation of 

areas of High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon 

Stock (HCS) in all our operations.

The HCS Approach Toolkit guides us in identifying areas 

suitable for planting or to be set aside for conservation. 

Through our internal and third-party accredited assessments,  

we have identified 23,279 hectares of HCV areas which 

include riparian areas, indigenous land, and habitats for 

endangered species. 

We also have HCV Management Plans at all our plantations. 

These plans have been assessed and accredited by 

licensed assessors. To deliver on our HCV Management 

Plans, 100% of our sites have HCV Rehabilitation Plans 

delivering results. We are committed to the rehabilitation 

of HCV areas and to deliver enriched biodiversity through 

reforestation especially in riparian areas. Since 2016, 

we have planted more than 182,000 trees in over 783 

hectares of HCV areas.

Prior to any new planting, HCV and HCS assessments are 

required.  During new planting and replanting in 2019, 

no primary forest or HCV land was affected. 

Regular training on HCV Monitoring and Rehabilitation 

is conducted for employees in our estates. This training 

aims to ensure that knowledge on HCV management and 

implementation of best-practices is fresh and relevant. 

Please see the map below for our concession areas with 

HCV Rehabilitation Plans. We maintain an inventory of 

satellite images of land cover, and we conduct regular field 

checks to verify the results of our remote analysis. Each of 

the HCV areas is surrounded with boundary pits to prevent 

encroachment. Signs are erected at HCV sites to prohibit 

hunting, logging, or burning in the HCV area. 

Through our HCV assessments, we have identified protected 

species in our concessions and surrounding areas. To protect 

the rich biodiversity in Indonesia’s rainforest, we operate 

a strict zero tolerance policy towards hunting, destroying, 

logging, or burning of protected species and wildlife.

PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT

Peatland Conservation

SINCE 2013: NO NEW PLANTING ON PEATLANDS AND 

WATER LEVELS MAINTAINED IN ALL PEATLANDS UNDER 

OUR CONTROL.

Peatlands store a third of the world’s soil carbon. If drained 

or burned, peatlands are a major source of carbon dioxide, 

the major greenhouse gas driving climate change. IndoAgri 

prohibits development on peat regardless of depth and 

complies with related regulations of the Government 

of Indonesia. All nucleus planting programmes must be 

approved at the IndoAgri Executive Board level. 

Our HCV management approach described in the previous 

section also applies to peatland. Additionally, we maintain 

a minimum water table depth for our existing cultivated 

peatland and we work closely with the Government and 

peat experts to ensure compliance.

Our initiatives include monitoring of water levels on estates 

using peat subsidence measurement, GIS remote sensing, and 

3D flood risk modelling. We apply canal engineering techniques 

to ensure sufficient water distribution during dry seasons. 

Fire Prevention

The impacts of forest fires can be catastrophic – loss of 

life, loss of biodiversity, and adverse impacts on the health 

of surrounding communities. Fires also incur long-term 

commercial, reputational, and financial costs to businesses. 

All operations and suppliers must comply with our zero-

burning requirement as set out in our Policy. All land-

clearing – for example, of non-productive oil palms – must 

be done mechanically, and good practices are shared with 

the communities.

IndoAgri takes a strident approach to monitoring hotspots 

and engaging stakeholders on fire prevention. Our ERM 

team sets out our strategy in responding to fire risks and 

scenarios. Satellite images from the National Oceanic 

and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National 

Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are 

monitored daily and compared with IndoAgri’s concession 

maps to identify hotspots. On-the-ground checks are 

conducted by our estate managers and specialist fire 

teams to verify any potential hotspots. A swift and decisive 

response is crucial in managing fire risks: the ERM team, 

estate and area managers, and specialist fire teams are in 

constant contact.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019




We have trained fire control teams and fire specialists 

across all our plantations. Our estates are equipped with 

vehicles and equipment for firefighting. Our fire specialists 

are regularly trained in fire prevention and firefighting. 

Training is done in collaboration with the Ministry of 

Environment and Forestry, the military, police, and the 

local government. IndoAgri delivered 39 fire control 

training days in 2019.

As of 2019, we have a total of 194 fire towers across all 

our estates. We continued with the implementation of our 

community collaboration programmes to build local capacity 

and knowledge to prevent fires. Since the launch of the 

programme in 2016, we have engaged 38 local villages, 

and in 2019, assisted in fire-fighting efforts at 26 villages.

Agricultural Inputs

While oil palm is, per hectare of land used, the most efficient 

oilseed crop in the world4, we at IndoAgri are constantly 

seeking ways to maximise and increase the palm oil yield 

in our operations. Our research teams work to improve soil 

fertility while minimising its degradation. Other focus areas 

include integrated pest and disease management, water 

conservation, fertiliser management, and recycling of mill 

by-products. A key objective of our research is to reduce 

pressure to convert or clear restricted or protected land for 

oil palm cultivation.

R&amp;D on protection against  

Ganoderma disease

Despite being identified more than 50 years ago, the lethal 

Ganoderma disease remains incurable. The disease usually 

affects mature plants and is more prevalent in plantations which 

have been replanted. If felled oil palm stumps are left to rot 

in the field, Ganoderma thrives and is likely to affect the next 

generation of palm trees. 

We began testing Ganoderma-resistant material in the field in 

2000, followed by other trials to test the resistance of breeding 

material. In 2016, we released two seed types with good resistance 

to Ganoderma infection in the field, so allowing potentially 

higher FFB production levels. In 2019, our R&amp;D teams went 

even further and produced an improved seed type for high oil 

content and improved resistance. Through a collaboration with 

researchers from the Jenderal Soedirman University, Indonesia, 

we have also achieved promising in vitro results to mitigate the 

growth of Ganoderma as well as to control certain pests of oil 

palm and cocoa trees. We are currently conducting further trials 

in our nursery and fields to verify our approach.

Ganoderma-resistant seeds produced by Bah Lias Research Station

We have implemented best practices in rubber tapping to 

maximise latex yield while maintaining the health and extending 

the useful life of the tree. 

For example, we use spot marking to predict when trees are 

mature and ready for tapping. We monitor the trees’ growth 

rates and girth, and conduct spot marking in the last few 

months before the tree reaches the optimum size for tapping. 

Tapping is also done at certain heights, based on each tree’s 

characteristics. Tapping panels, or the areas where a cut 

has been made into the bark, are rotated according to the 

condition of the panel and the tree. This enables latex yield 

maximisation.

We undertake good nursery and planting practices to increase 

uniformity in rubber tree growth and characteristics, so as to 

achieve good plantings with uniformity of girth.

FERTILISER CONSUMPTION

We are committed to the use of organic fertilisers in order 

to minimise the use of chemicals. We are scaling up soil 

and water improvement technologies using a blend of 

precise fertiliser dosage, slow-release dosing, and natural 

improvements. 

The use of fertilisers is tailored based on soil productivity 

and the age of trees in each plantation block. Whilst we 

administer fertiliser during planting and replanting, we 

also use leguminous cover crops to manage atmospheric 

nitrogen and improve the soil. We also recycle Empty Fruit 

Bunches (EFBs) and Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) for 

usage as a soil improver and compost. In our estates, we 

ensure appropriate interval between fertiliser applications 

and avoid applying fertilisers during heavy rain.

Improving Energy Efficiency, Reducing 

GHG Emissions

Our Sustainable Agriculture Policy commits us to improving 

our processes to improve our energy use efficiency and 

reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Besides 

mitigating climate change, improving our process efficiency 

also leads to lower costs. Our sustainability team continues 

working with colleagues from Indofood Group to focus on 

best management practices. 

We have 23 energy managers and 9 energy auditors across 

IndoAgri’s facilities. As 98% of fuel used in mills is already 

from renewable products, we focus our initiatives on increasing 

the percentage of renewable fuel used in refineries. Since the 

beginning of 2018, the boilers in our Lubuk Pakam Refinery, 

North Sumatra have switched from coal to palm shell entirely. 

We are also in the process of switching the fuel used in our 

Surabaya and Bitung refineries. 

From the success stories and achievements of our palm oil 

operations, we adopted these best practices in our other  

crop operations. We are pleased to report that two rubber 

factories, two sugar factories, one tea factory, and one cocoa 

factory are using renewable energy from palm shells and 

sugarcane bagasse. 

In 2019, energy consumption per tonne of FFB processed at 

our mills remained stable from 2018 levels at 2.24 GJ/tonne. 

Energy consumption per tonne of material produced at our 

refineries decreased by 4% from 1.00 GJ/tonne in 2018 to 

0.96 GJ/tonne in 2019. This decrease was a result of energy 

efficiency programmes implemented in the refineries, which 

included LED light installation and transitioning from diesel 

to electricity from the grid.

Energy consumption per tonne of rubber produced in our 

rubber factories decreased by 5% from 25.95 GJ/tonne in 

2018 to 24.77 GJ/tonne in 2019.

PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)

We apply IPM techniques to achieve a variety of benefits 

such as cost savings, lower risk to human health, and 

richer biodiversity. Natural, biological, and mechanical 

controls are preferred over chemical controls. Chemical 

pesticides are only deployed when our other controls have 

failed. We eliminated Paraquat from all our operations in 

March 2018.

Some examples of controls from our IPM are:

• barn owls to control rat populations in our estates,

• leguminous cover crops to suppress weeds,

• encouraging natural habitats for predators and parasites 

of leaf-eating insects, and

• use of pathogens i.e. virus and fungi to control  

leaf-eating insects.

PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

Our primary GHG emissions (69.6%) are from peat emissions. 

These emissions are not a result of the disturbance of 

peat, but from its naturally occurring, low-level methane 

emissions. As most of the  estates included in our scope are 

planted mostly in peat, peat accounts for the majority of our 

GHG emissions.   

In addition to land conversion, which accounted for 10.6% 

of our emissions, other sources of GHG emissions are 

methane from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), fuel usage 

in our mills and in the transport of FFB, chemical usage 

in mills and plantations, and nitrous oxide emission from 

fertilisers.

Total emissions from mills and estate operations decreased by 

3% from 1,850,180 tonnes of CO2e in 2018 to 1,798,661 

tonnes of CO2e in 2019. Total emissions in 2019 for each 

tonne of palm product were 2.13 tonnes of CO2e, a 7%  

increase from 1.99 tonnes of CO2e per tonne of palm product 

in 2018. This increase was due to a lower CPO and PK 

production in 2019 compared to 2018.

Emission related to transport of CPO to four refineries were 

0.05 tonnes CO2e per tonne of CPO transported (2018: 0.06  

tonnes CO2e per tonne of CPO transported). 

Our three aerated bunker composters continue to reduce 

methane emissions by 30%-70% compared with standard 

composting.

Water Use Efficiency

Water is a critical resource for our operations and the local 

communities living around our operations. With the changing 

climate, global water availability risk is an increasingly 

important issue, even in tropical and subtropical regions.

Water consumption is managed carefully at our oil palm and 

rubber operational sites. 

• Our rubber and oil palm estates in tropical Indonesia  

are entirely watered by seasonal rainfall. 

• 88% of mill water is from rivers. The rest is from 

groundwater and rain-harvest.

• 85% of water used in our refineries is from municipal 

sources while groundwater is 15%.

• 91% of water used in our rubber factories is from rivers, 

the rest is from groundwater.

• Water used in our offices and site accommodation in  

our plantations are from groundwater and rain-harvest.

All our sites passed the compulsory Environmental 

Impact Assessments (locally known as ‘Analisis Dampak 

Lingkungan’ or ‘AMDAL’) during their development. Water 

sources that are important to sustain local biodiversity and 

surrounding communities were identified under the HCV 

assessments (please refer to page 22 for more information). 

In 2019, we recorded no incidences of non-compliance in 

water use and wastewater management.

• At our mills: water consumption in 2019 remained 

stable from 2018 levels, at 1.01 m3 of water per tonne 

of FFB processed.  

• At our refineries: we used 0.07 m3 per tonne of material 

produced, a decrease of 6% compared to 2018 levels.

• At our rubber sites: we used 43.5 m3 of water per tonne 

of rubber processed.

Waste and Effluent Management

A systematic process for managing waste and effluents is 

important for efficiency and cost control. All sites have waste 

management systems guided by PROPER and ISO 14001. 

Our systems are also in compliance with the Indonesian 

regulations.

• At our mills: we produced an average of 1.39 tonnes 

of hazardous waste in 2019 (2018: 1.85 tonnes).

• At our refineries: we produced a total of 28,900 

tonnes of hazardous waste in 2019 (2018: 26,882 

tonnes), 78% of which was spent earth. We also 

produced a total of 2,170 tonnes of non-hazardous 

waste in 2019 (2018: 1,643 tonnes), 58% of this 

waste was sent for recycling while the other 42% was 

sent to the landfill.

• At our rubber factories: we produced an average of  

2.08 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2019.

Our estates and mills reuse 100% of milling waste.  

Milling waste is solid non-hazardous waste consisting of EFB, 

fibre, and shells, which we use as organic fertiliser or fuel 

for our boilers. The total weight of milling waste produced 

in 2019 was 1,472,586 tonnes (2018: 1,574,181 tonnes).

Effluent from milling, POME, is generated during the 

processing of FFB into CPO. Our solid waste and POME 

are managed in compliance with regulatory controls. Mill 

wastewater, such as POME, is treated on site. An aerated 

bunker composting system is in place at three mills sites.

• Mill effluent volume: we produced 2,079,788 m3 of 

wastewater from our 22 certified/audited mills, a decrease 

of 2% from 2018 levels (2018: 2,128,552 m3).

• Mill effluent quality: the median Biological Oxygen Demand  

(BOD) was 2,149 mg/l at the 22 mills (2018: 2,590 mg/l)  

while the median Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)  

was 5,951 mg/l at the 22 mills (2018: 6,594 mg/l).

Effluents from our refineries increased from 2018 levels. 

The quality remains in compliance with regulatory controls. 

All effluents are sent to wastewater treatment plants prior to 

release into water courses or municipal sewers.

• Refinery effluent volume: we produced 325,796 m3 of 

wastewater (2018: 245,759 m3).

• Refinery effluent quality: the median Biological Oxygen 

Demand (BOD) was 18 mg/l (2018: 12 mg/l) while the 

median Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was 54 mg/l 

(2018: 41 mg/l).

 

All effluents in our rubber factories are sent to wastewater 

treatment plants prior to release into water courses or 

municipal sewers.

• Rubber factories effluent quality: the median Biological 

Oxygen Demand (BOD) was 34 mg/l (2018: 26 mg/l) 

while the median Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was 

79 mg/l (2018: 63 mg/l). 

No spills of effluent, CPO, or diesel were recorded in 2019 

during harvesting, processing or transportation. No fines or 

sanctions related to environmental regulations were imposed 

on IndoAgri in 2019. No significant environmental-related 

complaints were received from our stakeholders in 2019.

100% of hazardous waste is disposed and managed according  

to national regulations and transported by an accredited 

third-party.

operations in 2017 but remains as a non-operational asset, and one new mill was commissioned in September 2019, thus we have a total of  

26 operational mills.

ISPO Certification

Developed by the Indonesian Government, the Indonesian 

Sustainable Palm Oil certification system (ISPO) is a 

mandatory certification for all oil palm growers in the 

country. ISPO aims to cultivate a sustainable plantation 

industry, and in the process contribute to the Indonesian 

Government’s commitments to reduce GHG. Independent 

smallholders are currently exempt from ISPO, but the 

Government plans to make participation mandatory in  

the future. 

To register for ISPO certification, palm oil companies have 

to first pass a Plantation Business Assessment, Penilaian 

Usaha Perkebunan (PUP) administered by the Regional 

Plantation Estates Office to ensure that the company’s 

operations have implemented ISPO requirements. The ISPO 

audit is conducted by a government approved certification 

body in two stages; the first stage is a compliance audit of 

plantation licenses and required business documentation, 

and the second stage is plantation audit and assessments.

ESTATES TO MILLS

FFB arriving at IndoAgri mills are sourced from our 

plantations, of which 20% are from our plasma smallholders. 

100% of FFB processed at mills we control, can be traced 

back to a plantation of origin. 

Our Sustainable Agriculture Policy commits us to traceable 

palm oil that ensures:

• no deforestation,

• preservation of HCV areas and HCS forests,

• no planting on peat regardless of depth,

• no burning, 

• respect for labour and human rights, 

• Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).

We conduct annual audits on our plantations, including  

our plasma smallholders, to ensure 100% compliance with 

our Policy.

MILLS TO REFINERIES

75% of CPO processed in our refineries is from IndoAgri 

mills, while the other 25% is from third-party mills. 

All IndoAgri and third-party CPO suppliers must formally 

accept our Sustainable Agriculture Policy and Supplier 

Guidelines. We regularly assess risk levels of all our own 

mills on an annual basis as part of our risk management and 

audit process. 

For our third-party suppliers, we track their names, parent 

company, ownership structure, scale of operations, and 

location coordinates. We also regularly engage with them 

to ensure compliance with our Policy. Major findings and 

recommendations will be communicated and followed-up. We 

will cease supplies from uncooperative and non-complying  

third-party mills. In 2019, we ceased sourcing from one 

supplier due to non-compliance with our Policy.

In 2019, 75% of CPO volume from suppliers complied with 

our Sustainable Agriculture Policy. By 2020, all our CPO 

suppliers must operate in accordance with our Policy.

Supplier Engagement and Assessment

At IndoAgri, we understand that sustainable supply 

chains and procurement practices have the most positive 

environmental, social, and economic impacts across the 

entire production lifecycle. Our Sustainable Agriculture 

Policy and commitment to ISPO aligns with sustainable 

procurement 

practices 

that 

promote 

accountability, 

transparency, and fair opportunity.

INDOFOOD AGRI RESOURCES LTD


RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

The scope of our Policy includes our nucleus and plasma 

estates, our mills, and all our third-party CPO suppliers.

As more than 75% of our CPO supply is from our own mills, 

we focus our Policy compliance audit on our internal supply 

chains. In 2019, we conducted 191 visits, workshops, and 

audits on 100% of our mills and their supplying estates. 

Besides compliance to our Policy, our assessments also 

focus on:

• agronomy (good agricultural practices, yield, soil 

health, crop protection),

• responsible operations (safety, biodiversity, peatland, 

fire risk, human rights, community engagement, FPIC),

• efficiency of operations (energy and water 

consumption, GHG emissions, waste production), and

• compliance with government regulations and ISPO 

certifications.

While all IndoAgri suppliers must meet regulatory and 

commercial conditions, our procurement team treats 

all suppliers equally, with respect to price, quality, and 

capacity.

To achieve a resilient supply chain, we implement initiatives 

to improve the agricultural productivity and sustainability 

certification of our smallholders (see page 38). We also 

run various community projects which aim to improve 

local socio-economic development and micro-enterprise 

opportunities (see page 53). 

HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

IndoAgri’s human rights assessments are based on our 

Sustainable Agriculture Policy, the ISPO certification, 

and the Indonesian Government regulations. There were 

zero human rights related breaches reported through our 

whistle-blowing mechanism.

We report our human rights assessments based on our 

ISPO certification achievements. As such, 80% of our 

operational units have been formally assessed for human 

rights risk as of 2019. 

All ISPO audits include criteria for assessing human 

rights risks for new suppliers. The competence developed 

through the ISPO certification process also informs and 

guides other IndoAgri sites which are preparing for ISPO 

certification. 

Please refer to page 44 for more information on our 

commitment to respecting human rights.

Yield Improvement

As described in the environmental performance section 

above, improving our yields and those of our smallholders 

is vitally important as it brings higher revenues, and helps 

to reduce the pressure for additional conversion of land for 

agricultural purposes. Oil palm seeds from our Bah Lias 

Research Station and SAIN Research Stations, which are 

both certified to quality management system ISO 9001, can 

potentially produce 34 tonnes of FFB per hectare. We use the 

seeds in our own plantations, but a large proportion is sold to 

external parties. 

We apply the ‘block-based management’ approach in the 

performance monitoring of palm trees in our plantations. 

Palm trees are classified into individual blocks of around 

30-hectares each. The quality and yield achievements of our 

trees are then monitored on a ‘per block’ basis. By looking at 

individual blocks, the estate managers and field assistants 

can compare the performance of trees within a block with 

the other blocks. This allows us to effectively identify issues 

affecting the trees in a certain block and hence efficiently 

address them.

Block-based Management for  

Effective Palm Tree Management



Oil palm trees in block-based plantations from replanting activities 

at Riau

Palm oil yield is affected by various conditions, such as age 

of palm trees, seed quality, soil and weather conditions, 

plantation management, and the timely harvesting and 

processing of FFB. Our agronomy research teams are 

continuously experimenting and implementing techniques 

for improvement. Some achievements by our team include 

advanced planting materials with improved resilience 

against the Ganoderma disease, shorter duration to 

maturity for harvest, and higher oil content. 

Our smallholders are also expected to meet the same FFB 

quality criteria as our nucleus plantations. Please see the 

next section on Smallholder Engagement for details on the 

support we provide to improve our plasma smallholders’ 

agronomy practices and certification to ISPO.

37

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019


Our Smallholder Programme aims to increase ISPO certification 

for plasma and independent smallholders. The smallholders 

in this programme understand that the ISPO certification will 

improve their agricultural practices, labour practices, and 

access to markets. 

In 2019, we assisted ten KUDs in the first and second stage 

ISPO audits. One of the ten KUD is awaiting certificate issuance 

in 2020.

We provide further assistance to KUDs as and when 

necessary. For example, we helped KUD Teratai Biru 

establish a new business unit to achieve greater financial 

independence. As KUD Teratai Biru was still receiving 

funding support from IndoAgri for its certification process  

as of 2019, it planned to create another business unit and use 

the profits generated to finance the certification process. With 

the help of IndoAgri, KUD Teratai Biru acquired assistance from 

SNV, an international non-profit organization, to train new staff 

to manage the new business unit.

The training was conducted at KUD Teratai Biru’s office  

over two days and was attended by 15 staff members.  

SNV introduced basic components in a business model  

using the Business Model Canvas. After the training, KUD 

Teratai Biru established its new business unit with the  

help of SNV and IndoAgri. SNV also provided mentoring 

assistance in the initial months of establishment, from  

August to December 2019.

In Indonesia, smallholders represent more than 40% 

of all oil palm cultivation. Oil palm cultivation has lifted 

millions of rural households out of poverty, and reduced 

inequalities between urban and rural populations. As the 

palm oil industry is critical in Indonesia’s rural economy, it 

is crucial to include smallholder farmers in sustainable palm 

oil production approaches. 

We encourage – and provide training to – our smallholders 

on good agronomic practices and materials management. As 

a result, we hope that our smallholders can improve their 

techniques for better yields and achieve higher income which 

will in turn reduce socio-economic pressure to clear new

as seed stocks and fertilisers are affordable.

We also provide financial plans to encourage smallholders to 

cultivate larger areas, and to use better equipment, seeds, 

and materials. Plasma farmers can then eventually become 

a viable and independent business: once they fully repay 

their financial loans from IndoAgri, they obtain management 

control and land title deeds. 

OPPORTUNITIES FROM 

SMALLHOLDER CERTIFICATION



Guided by The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) and 

IndoAgri, KUD Teratai Biru will be the first 

of the twelve co-operatives to achieve the 

ISPO certification in 2020.

Here, we report the experience of an independent 

smallholder, Pairan. He started as a palm plantation 

worker in South Sumatra before becoming a smallholder 

business owner. He now owns an oil palm plantation and 

is the Chairperson of KUD Teratai Biru, composed of 

157 farmers managing a total area of 318.62 hectares.   

“My first seven years at KUD Teratai Biru were challenging. 

Our cooperative of smallholder farmers lacked crucial 

resources such as good agronomy knowledge and 

administrative systems to run the cooperative effectively.

Then, in 2015, IndoAgri welcomed us to the 

Smallholder Certification Partner Project. 

The programme taught us field management 

and harvesting skills and equipped us with 

financial and administrative knowledge 

to run the cooperative. We have greatly 

benefitted from the programme and as a 

result, can run our independent business 

effectively. The programme also introduced us to the 

ISPO certifications. This has provided us with access 

to stronger markets, subsidies, grants, and greater 

financial returns.”

The Indonesian government plans to make ISPO mandatory 

for smallholder farmers. Despite the challenges from 

high certification costs, we aim to support and assist our 

smallholders achieve ISPO certification once it is mandated.

INTRODUCTION The agricultural industry is critical for rural economic growth in Indonesia. 

IndoAgri provides employment to more than 62,000 people and 47,000 plasma smallholders 

in Indonesia. As an employer of thousands, we take our responsibility to provide a safe and 

healthy workplace very seriously. We are committed to ensuring that everyone goes home safe. 

In this section, we report on our initiatives and progress in improving labour conditions and 

ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our workforce.

PROGRESS IN 2019

INDOFOOD AGRI RESOURCES LTD




OUR PEOPLE

Health and Safety

We take our responsibility in providing a healthy and safe 

working environment very seriously. The main objective of 

our health and safety management system is to ensure that 

everyone goes home safe. We regret to report that there were 

two fatalities in 2019, both from our palm oil operations. 

Senior managers visited the bereaved families, who receive 

compensation from IndoAgri. We also assisted the families 

in obtaining compensation from the Badan Penyelenggara 

Jaminan Sosial (BPJS), an Indonesian backed social 

security system that provides coverage and protection for 

the victims. We will conduct formal investigations into 

each accident, review the causes, and implement a series 

of corrective actions to prevent future accidents of the 

same sort from taking places. 

OHS experts are available in each of IndoAgri’s operational 

sites. These OHS experts conduct periodic reviews 

in our operational sites to ensure that all sites comply 

with IndoAgri’s health and safety management system. 

We also ensure the upkeep of our facilities and conduct 

regular health and safety training for our workers. Daily 

safety briefings are held for workers in our estates, mills, 

refineries, and factories to ensure protection from hazards 

via proper use of their personal protective equipment as 

well as to inculcate a safety mindset among our people. 

We also identify employees who operate in high-risk 

environments and have developed SOPs to safeguard their 

wellbeing. Examples of high-risk employees include our 

chemical sprayers and operators of generators in estates, 

welders and operators of boilers in mills, and security 

officers across our operations. The SOPs for our high-risk 

employees are in accordance with national regulations 

and are reviewed regularly.

All our sites in Indonesia are operating according to the 

SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen Keselamatan dan Kesehatan 

Kerja), Indonesia’s national OHS standard. 51 sites (43 in 

palm oil, 4 in rubber, and 4 in other crop operations) also 

achieved SMK3 Gold certification. SMK3 refresher training 

are conducted across all our sites every year. This is to 

ensure day-to-day SMK3 compliance of all our workers at 

their respective sites. 

While we apply Integrated Pest Management and have eliminated 

the use of Paraquat in all our operations, the use of synthetic 

pesticides, alongside natural approaches, is still necessary to 

improve agricultural productivity. We are particularly committed 

to the safety of our people carrying out chemical spraying tasks. 

They must complete special training and strictly follow IndoAgri’s 

SOPs on the handling and management of chemicals, for example:

• Pesticides to be mixed by government-certified 

employees only

• Pesticide mixing must be done in a bright and  

well-ventilated location

• Before work commences, food is provided to all 

chemical sprayers during the morning briefing

• The estate manager and foreman must ensure that staff 

wear the required PPE 

• A foreman is to oversee the task until completion

• Upon completion of spraying, sprayers must shower 

in designated areas and their laundry segregated into 

dedicated washing machines

• Staff are not allowed to do spraying tasks for more than 

five hours per day

• No spraying work is allowed under wet or windy 

conditions.

Besides strict compliance with the above SOPs, we conduct 

biannual medical checks for our chemical sprayers and provide 

them with access to their test results.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019


OUR PEOPLE

As our rubber products are exported internationally, all our 

rubber operations are certified to the international OHSAS 

18001:2007 standard, which provides a framework to 

identify, control, and decrease health and safety risks in 

the workplace. 

SEASONAL CONTRACT WORKERS

We hire seasonal contract workers for peak season 

tasks. Our contract workers are usually from the local 

communities and related to our full-time employees. 

Contract employment in seasonal agricultural work remains 

attractive in rural Indonesia as the job flexibility allows 

workers to tend to other activities such as juggling a variety 

of household jobs, or in other income-generating activities 

such as cultivating their own crops and running small 

businesses.

The hiring of contract workers complies with government 

regulation, our Code of Conduct, our Policy, and the 

Principles and Criteria of ISPO. Each seasonal worker's 

contract respects government regulations, and we ensure 

that they understand their rights and responsibilities. As 

non-registered persons are banned from working on our 

sites, all seasonal workers are registered by our Human 

Resource Department and logged on to the fingerprint 

recognition system. The attendance of contract workers 

and their completed volume of work is maintained on a 

daily register as well as an online system.

IndoAgri complies with and applies the formula prescribed in 

the Government Regulation No. 78 of 2015 which regulates 

the calculation of wages for contract workers. Depending 

on skills and job availability, our seasonal workers can 

be promoted as permanent workers. Job vacancies are 

announced during the daily morning briefings and on the 

announcement boards of our estates, mills, and the relevant 

village head’s (kepala desa) office.

Having considered their skills and duration of service, 

IndoAgri has hired 992 contract workers (including seasonal 

contract workers) as permanent workers in 2019.

CHILD LABOUR

IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDONESIAN LAWS, WE STRICTLY 

DISALLOW THOSE BELOW AGE 18 FROM WORKING AT 

OUR SITES. BASED ON OUR EMPLOYEE DATABASE, NO 

REGISTERED INDOAGRI WORKER IS UNDER 18 YEARS 

OF AGE.

IndoAgri takes proactive measures to prevent child labour 

from arising. As education is critical in drawing children 

from fields, we provide free education and day care facilities 

to the children of our employees in estates. This approach 

also ensures a safe place for our workers’ children whilst 

their parents work, hence eliminating the likelihood of 

workers bringing their children to work.

We are very strict in preventing all forms of child labour in 

our operations. Our Human Resource department verifies the 

identification card of all applicants to ensure that we do not 

employ anyone below the age of 18. Employment contracts

Our health and safety data relate to all IndoAgri group assets, not solely palm oil and rubber operations. There is no change in scope or 

methodology for our health and safety indicators.

Accident frequency rate (AFR) is calculated as follows: No. of Workplace Accidents x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked (number of 

employees x 40 hours x 50 weeks).

7 

Accident severity rate (ASR) is calculated as follows: No. of Workdays Lost x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked. ASR gives an average 

of the number of lost days per recordable incident. It is recorded when an employee is referred to a clinic due to a workplace accident and 

given leave of absence. In accordance with regulations, we track the accident if the lost day is more than one day.

Labour Rights and Human Rights

NO OPERATIONS OR SUPPLIERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS 

HAVING SIGNIFICANT RISK RELATING TO COLLECTIVE 

BARGAINING, FORCED LABOUR, OR CHILD LABOUR  

IN 2019.

IndoAgri is committed to ensuring that the rights of 

all people working in our operations are respected and 

represented. We adhere to all national and local laws, 

including laws on employees’ freedom of association and 

collective bargaining, decent pay and working hours, non-

discrimination and equal opportunities, and the elimination 

of forced and child labour.

44

INDOFOOD AGRI RESOURCES LTD






OUR PEOPLE

for all workers include a clause on disallowing children to 

help with agricultural production work. Signs and posters 

reminding workers not to bring children are placed in all our 

plantation sites. Disciplinary actions will be taken against 

those who do not comply. 

DIVERSITY 

IN 2019, THERE WERE NO INCIDENTS OF DISCRIMINATION 

OR HARASSMENT REPORTED VIA OUR WHISTLE-BLOWING 

FACILITY, OR TO OUR GENDER COMMITTEES.

We are committed to upholding the principle of equal 

opportunities and supporting the inclusion of women across 

our operations including addressing barriers faced. We have 

zero tolerance for sexual harassment and conduct regular 

socialisation initiatives to ensure all our workers adhere to 

our gender policies. 

Gender Committees are in place in our work units to foster 

clear understanding of gender equality and to promote the 

participation of women in the workforce. These committees 

also manage the harassment complaint services. Our 

Gender Committees play an important role in maintaining 

and enhancing the role of women in estates, mills and 

households.

In accordance to the Indonesian labour law, all permanent 

workers are entitled to maternity and menstrual leave. Jobs 

of new mothers are reserved while they are on maternity 

leave. In 2019, 308 women took maternity leave (2018: 

359), 86% or 264 women returned to the same job position 

(80% in 2018). The rest remained on leave or chose to 

leave the company. All benefits and allowances paid out to 

our female employees also complies with Indonesian labour 

laws and respects local cultural norms.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION

Freedom of association and participation in labour unions 

is implemented via the Indonesian Law No. 21 of 2000. 

We fully comply with this regulation and believe there 

are no sites where the right to freedom of association is 

at significant risk. All our workers are free to register 

themselves directly with their preferred labour union and 

bargain collectively. As at end 2019, 61% (2018: 62%) of 

our operational employees were registered with a union. The 

remainder are covered by a company regulation known as 

Peraturan Perusahaan. 

We engage regularly with the labour unions of our workers 

through bipartite meetings to discuss issues such as 

agreement on wages and daily harvesting quotas to ensure 

appropriate and achievable workload for our harvesters.

OUR PEOPLE

Employee Welfare

Our Work and Estate Living programme provides essential 

medical support, facilities, and infrastructure for the people 

living on our estates. Our projects focus on household 

hygiene, healthy living, and free access to medical facilities. 

Please refer to page 53 for our section on Investing 

in Communities and page 55 for more information on 

healthcare and education facilities which employees and 

their dependents enjoy free of charge.

FAIR WAGES AND ACCESS TO BENEFITS

We ensure that all IndoAgri employees are adequately 

compensated for their work. Our Human Resource 

department ensures that all workers receive a wage that is 

equal to or above the minimum wage set by their respective 

regional governments.

Each region consists of a number of provinces.

9 

This refers to the lowest legal minimum wage in the region, which differs based on the province, sector, and collective labour agreement in 

that region. 

10 Remuneration figures above include wages and cash benefits for rice allowance. The rice allowance is calculated on the basis that the worker 

is unmarried, with married workers receiving additional rice allowance for dependents. Only operative workers in the plantations and factories 

(excluding refineries) are eligible to receive rice allowance.

At IndoAgri, all complaints and grievances are taken very 

seriously. In June 2016, three NGOs submitted a formal 

complaint to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 

alleging instances of labour law violations at one of our 

subsidiaries.

Following more than twenty rounds of RSPO-accredited 

audits over a period of two years between 2016 and 2018, 

the RSPO issued a verification report in November 2018. The 

report was based on findings from the final audit conducted 

in June 2018 and was inconsistent with the findings from 

the 23 previous RSPO-accredited audits, which we passed 

as RSPO compliant. Despite our efforts to engage with the 

RSPO Complaints Panel and RSPO auditor, we were denied 

the opportunity to meet the Complaints Panel or to present 

our evidence. RSPO also failed to address the inconsistencies 

in the findings of the June 2018 audit.

After 15 years of commitment and working diligently to 

comply with the RSPO, we made the difficult decision 

to withdraw from the RSPO in February 2019. In view of 

the decision by RSPO, we engaged a legal firm, Hiswara 

Bunjamin and Tandjung (HBT) in association with Herbert 

Smith Freehills, to conduct a legal review at our disputed 

locations in North Sumatra. Based on the review conducted 

in September 2019, HBT concluded that the allegations 

were unfounded and that we fully complied with the labour 

laws of the Government of Indonesia.

The full report including the methodology and analysis by 

HBT is available on our website.

with Indonesian Labour Laws



Work and Estate Living programme provides essential medical support

We are committed to improve the benefits and incentives for 

all our employees and workers to improve job satisfaction. 

Besides competitive remuneration, we provide housing, 

sports facilities, places of worship, educational institutions 

such as schools, and medical facilities. 

lndoAgri employees also benefit from a government pension 

scheme, additional contributions from the company, 

and retirement packages (aligned with the Indonesian 

government BPJS insurance scheme).

OUR PEOPLE

Training and Development

Our people are our most important asset. We are constantly 

exploring ways to better manage our human capital. We have 

a specific budget allocated to training programmes every 

year. Guided by the Total Quality Management principles, 

our modules and initiatives seek to improve the career 

development, job satisfaction, and welfare of our employees. 

Programmes 

such 

as 

Managerial 

Development 

and 

Administrative Development for aspiring estates, mills, and 

refineries managers are available for employees who are 

interested in assuming leadership roles and advancing their 

career path. In 2019, we offered a list of training topics for 

our employees, ranging from environmental sustainability 

and technical agricultural skills to non-technical skills, such 

as effective decision-making and self-awareness. 

We report a 10% permanent employee turnover in 2019, 

compared to 6% in 2018. See figures on training, turnover, 

and new hires data on pages 48-49.

All employees from staff-level and above complete an annual 

performance and career development review. This appraisal 

process is an important milestone in our employees’ career 

as their performances, strengths and areas of improvement 

are evaluated objectively. This allows IndoAgri to reward 

and retain high performance with a competitive rewards 

package. It also helps implement the Balanced Scorecard 

for individual employees, which tracks their performance 

against individual targets. The scorecard focuses on quality, 

cost, regulatory, and social practices, as well as culture 

change and learning.

EQUIPPED THROUGH A STRUCTURED 

TRAINING PROGRAMMES 

“I joined IndoAgri as an Agro-technology graduate from 

the University of Riau, Indonesia. 

 

IndoAgri’s structured training programme 

for Field Assistants has been immensely 

useful for my learning and development. 

The six-month programme includes both classroom 

and on-the-job training, and has equipped me with the 

theoretical and practical skills on plantation management 

and the cultivation of oil palm trees. We were also exposed 

to the development of digitisation and application of 

technology in IndoAgri, which is critical in improving 

the productivity of our operations. Besides that, the 

programme has also prepared me with the necessary 

leadership and interpersonal skills to work effectively with 

my colleagues. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity 

to be part of the programme.”

Land Rights

Despite the complex land tenure systems in rural Indonesia, we 

remain steadfast in respecting the rights of indigenous people 

through our commitment to the principles of FPIC. 

Every land transaction that we are involved in complies with 

Indonesian law and company policy. Prior to the development of 

every estate, we conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment 

(AMDAL) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA), which enables 

us to identify baseline conditions and likely social impacts of 

development. 100% of our operations have undergone AMDAL 

and SIA, in accordance with Indonesian law. The assessment 

results and our land development plans are shared with the 

local village government and community to obtain their input 

and approval. For cases involving land compensation, we have 

established certification and confirmation processes for proof 

of ownership, to ensure that the right person is compensated, 

with the village head present as witness. Our company 

policies and processes are designed to promote working with 

communities and governments on land tenure and rights 

with open negotiations, inclusive decision-making, and clear 

agreements. 

We go beyond regulatory compliance to support the livelihoods 

of our farmers, suppliers, and their families living in our 

development areas; 100% of our estates have community 

development and engagement programmes. Additionally, we 

allocate 20% of new plantation land developed from 2007 

onwards for plasma smallholders. 

In the event of complaints on land rights, local communities 

can file these complaints with IndoAgri or with the Indonesian 

government. Complaints addressed to IndoAgri have to follow a 

grievance mechanism system in which supporting documents 

are required to be submitted as proof. Complaints addressed 

to the government usually involve the local government 

office or land agency office (BPN). In 2019, there were no 

recorded incidents of FPIC violations, violations of the rights 

of indigenous peoples, or land rights issues involving IndoAgri. 

Beyond land rights complaints, operational, social and 

environmental-related complaints from the community are 

also processed through our grievance mechanism, where the 

relevant company representatives verify, follow up and mediate 

to resolve the issues. There is also room for whistle-blowing 

through IndoAgri’s usual engagement with the community, such 

as during fire training days and regular stakeholder meetings. 

Investing in Communities

As an agribusiness in rural Indonesia, we recognise the crucial 

role we play in the wellbeing of the communities we operate 

in. We aim to contribute to the socio-economic development 

of our suppliers, their families, and the communities living in 

the vicinity of our operations. Beyond providing employment to 

thousands living in remote areas, we contribute to the holistic 

development of communities through a range of initiatives 

in education, health, infrastructure, microenterprise, farmer 

training, culture, and humanitarian support. 

ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE

We continue to ensure access to healthcare for the 

communities at each of our operating sites. In each estate, 

we have set up clinics and first aid posts for workers and their 

families. On a wider community level, we operate Posyandu 

which provide monthly health check-ups, immunisation, food 

and nutritional supplements, and counselling. Posyandu 

are also equipped with additional infrastructure to promote 

maternal and infant healthcare. 

One of the challenges we face is in getting mothers and their 

children to visit the Posyandu regularly for check-ups. Hence, 

we try our best to communicate to mothers the importance 

of regular check-ups. Other efforts to maintain good quality 

healthcare service include the replacement of faulty 

equipment at all our Posyandu. This project was conducted 

in collaboration with our parent company, Indofood, and was 

completed this year.

In 2019, we have 189 medical clinics in our estates, and 

194 Posyandu, supported by 267 midwives/nurses and 59 

doctors. Moving forward, we are considering conducting 

training programmes for new village health workers as part 

of our succession planning in maintaining the Posyandu. 

Cleft Lip Surgery Programme

Agriculture Day event in Malang, East Java on November 2019



This year, we continued to conduct our Cleft Lip Surgery 

Programme for children born with a cleft lip or cleft palate. 

Through this programme, we collaborate with hospitals and 

non-profit organisations to search for cases, counsel families, 

provide examinations, the surgery, as well as postoperative 

care and speech therapy. 

In 2019, the team together with 33 volunteers delivered 

delivered 113 successful surgeries for 91 beneficiaries, 

bringing the total number of surgeries and beneficiaries since 

2014 to 500 and 435 respectively.

TESTIMONY OF A VOLUNTEER



“I have been a volunteer since 2014. At that time, 

our Posyandu only offered weighing and immunisation 

services. Now however, we have a more complete 

range of facilities and equipment that enable 

us to provide higher quality healthcare 

services. In 2016, we received training at the Rambung  

Sialang Training Centre in South Sumatra from 

professionals, that increased our understanding of 

the benefits of Posyandu. Now, we actively promote 

our Posyandu and the importance of healthcare to the 

community. 

I want to thank IndoAgri for increasing our 

capacity to benefit the community.”

Elyda Sari Harahap, from Posyandu in Riau  

COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND FOOD SECURITY

Our PROKLIM projects are part of a national programme to 

increase community resilience and food security, as well as 

promote local climate change mitigation and adaptation action 

in agriculture, waste and energy. Through our PROKLIM projects, 

we help to strengthen community resilience, contribute to 

national GHG emission targets, improve local-level coordination 

to deliver climate change policies, and provide opportunities 

for local villages to adopt low-carbon technologies. Examples 

of initiatives that have benefitted local communities include 

diversification of crops that lead to additional income and 

strengthened food security, as well as energy reduction efforts 

and composting that lead to cost savings. We have received 7 

awards from the Ministry for Environment and Forestry this year, 

and 13 awards in total since the programme first began in 2016. 

Receiving these awards has motivated us to continue raising 

awareness on environmental issues and contribute to the 

reduction of GHG emissions of local communities. We will 

continue to support more IndoAgri units in implementing 

PROKLIM programmes. 

Our plans for the future are represented in the new IndoAgri Care 

&amp; Ownership programme, which aims to protect the environment 

and encourage sustainable behaviour among IndoAgri employees 

and their families. This programme covers the entire IndoAgri 

operating area, from plantations to factories and offices. The 

focus areas are reduction of paper and plastic use, waste 

management, and water and energy-saving behaviour. Our hope 

is that the initiatives from this programme will go beyond the 

workplace to be implemented in employees’ daily lives and 

families. At the plantation level, these initiatives are being 

spearheaded by wives of our employees. In the longer term, 

we hope to promote these initiatives digitally, thus overcoming 

larger distances to increase our community outreach.

Empowering Women

At some of our estates in Riau, the PROKLIM programme 

provided support for women from our employees’ families. The 

programme has given them the access to create products using 

resources from their surroundings, to supplement and diversify 

their household income. Such products include moringa tea, 

moringa soap, and citronella essential oil. The raw materials 

used in these products are from plants in their backyards. 

The women were able to distribute and sell their products 

through Rumah Pintar, which provided assistance for their 

business plans, product development and diversification, 

packaging design, marketing, and distribution. 

In 2019, these women were recognised for their innovative 

spirits and were invited by the local government to present their 

product at the event in Malang, East Java. In 2020, they will 

expand and diversify their product offerings and collaborate 

with the local government to train other women’s groups in 

neighbouring communities.

TESTIMONY OF A MOTHER

“The Posyandu has become very important to us. 

Previously we only came if we wanted to immunise 

children, but now we come regularly to receive healthcare 

information, extra food for our toddlers, as well as 

vitamin A supplements and anti-parasitic medication for 

our children.  

 

Everything is given absolutely free of 

charge, including our children’s vaccines. 

I am thankful to IndoAgri for caring for the 

growth and development of our children.”

PRODUCT INTEGRITY

FOOD SAFETY

We are committed to maintaining the trust our consumers 

have in our safe, high-quality products. Formal management 

processes ensure that we adhere to high standards of 

production. To stay updated on the latest food safety 

standards, our Quality Control teams responsible for product 

quality assurance undergo regular training on hygiene, 

safety, and Halal risk and control. Our production sites and 

suppliers are also audited annually on hygiene, sanitation, 

and housekeeping. 

With a revised version of FSSC 22000 requirements 

released this year, we undertook initiatives to meet the 

additional requirements applicable to us as an edible oil 

producer, such as ensuring all our third party laboratories 

are accredited, not using the FSSC logo from non-marketing 

materials, and ensuring the implementation of allergen 

management, food defense and the prevention of food 

frauds. As such, we are on track to achieving certification to 

the latest food management system standard FSSC 22000 

Version 5 for our Tanjung Priok Refinery, when it applies 

beginning January 2020. 

Our EOF division produced 974,000 tonnes of CPO in 

2019. 38% was manufactured at our FSSC 22000-certified 

Tanjung Priok Refinery. Additionally, all IndoAgri product 

packaging meets the Indonesian National food safety 

standards.

In 2019, we recorded zero incidents of non-compliance with 

regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of our products. We also experienced zero 

incidents of product recall. 

NUTRITION

More than 80% of our edible oils and fats products serve the 

consumers in the domestic Indonesian market. Our cooking 

oils are marketed under our Bimoli, Bimoli Spesial, Delima 

and Happy brands, while our margarine and shortening 

consumer products are packed and sold under our Royal 

Palmia, Palmia and Amanda brands. 

This year, we partially eliminated hydrogenated fat from our 

products by substituting hardened fat with interesterified (IE) 

oil. To meet the Indonesian government regulation, effective 

from 1 January 2020, on the fortification of cooking oil with 

vitamin A, we successfully secured a supplier who was able 

to fulfil our required volume. Pipelines and dosing pumps 

for vitamin A have also been prepared in all factory units. 

Please visit our website for more information on  

key products and markets served http://www.indofoodagri.com/

edible-oils-and-fats-division.html

NUTRITION FACTS

Our products provide 

carotenoid (for vitamin A) and 

tocopherol (for vitamin E) to 

ensure consumers achieve a 

balanced diet and to mitigate 

risk of vitamin deficiency.

Our products are fortified  

with essential vitamins. 

These vitamins strengthen 

the immune system, eyesight 

and the developing foetus in 

utero. These vitamins also 

improve cell development, 

enzymes and a healthy 

nervous system.

Our exported cooking 

oils to the Philippines 

are further enriched 

with vitamin A, as 

required by regulations 

in that market. 

We take vitamin fortification 

beyond compliance. Whilst 

vitamins A and D are mandated 

by Indonesian law, as a 

manufacturer of high-quality 

food products, we aim to 

contribute to the healthy diet 

of Indonesians. For example, 

we have also added vitamins E, 

B1, B2, Niacin, Folic Acid and 

B12 in our table margarine.

PRODUCT INFORMATION 

We comply with all national and export market requirements 

on marketing and communication of product information. 

Our product packaging complies with the Indonesian policy 

on Extended Producer Responsibility. We continue to 

investigate the technology solutions to replace our packaging 

materials with fully biodegradable packaging. Our palm oil 

brand Delima has had its 1-litre pouches modified to a 

thinner packaging that requires less plastic since January 

2018, and trials are ongoing for further modifications to 

create more eco-friendly packaging. We also encourage 

environmentally-friendly behaviour by consumers as we do 

not provide plastic bags at campaign bazaars.

In 2019, we continued our focus on marketing and 

communication programmes that educate consumers on the 

benefits of palm oil. Our key marketing programmes include 

TV commercials, digital and social media, and marketing 

activities such as cooking classes. 

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Our products are reputed for their quality, price, and consumer 

confidence. We recognise that meeting consumer needs 

are critical in maintaining their confidence in our brands. 

We regularly engage consumers to address their concerns, 

including communicating our sustainability progress and 

responsible supply chain practices, investigating areas of 

concern and making improvements based on feedback. 

We also conduct annual customer satisfaction surveys to 

obtain feedback on product and service quality. In 2019, 

we surveyed a total of 101 industrial customers and 79 

distributors. We received a score of 83% for industrial 

customers and 85% for distributors, exceeding our targets 

of 75% and 72% respectively.

In recognition of our marketing performance, we received an 

AA+ rating under the Most Valuable Indonesia Brands award 

for Bimoli this year, an improvement from AA previously. 

Our more affordable palm oil brand Delima has seen its 

market share grow positively. We will continue to capitalize 

on Delima as 2nd brand in the lower-class segment. We 

believe that there are opportunities in educating consumers 

about the health benefits and versatility of palm oil.

We will continue to innovate and offer new products at 

competitive price points, improve customer service and 

enhance product labelling and packaging.

oils brands. 

This report presents our sustainability performance for 

2019. The scope of this report covers our most dominant 

crop, oil palm, which occupies 83% of our total planted 

area, and our rubber operations which occupy 6% of our 

total planted area. We have expanded the scope of this year’s 

sustainability report to include our rubber operations. There 

is no significant change to the size, structure or ownership of 

our company compared to the previous report.

Our environmental data includes the following sites in our 

palm oil and rubber operations: 

• ISPO-certified/audited plantations: 53 out of 82 sites 

(2018: 39 sites)

• ISPO- or PROPER-certified/audited mills: 22 out of  

27 sites

• PROPER-certified/audited refineries: 4 out of 5 sites

• Rubber plantations: 8 out of 8 sites

• Rubber factories: 3 out of 4 sites

Financial, employee, community, and health and safety data

data include only our palm oil operations.

We report restatements from previous reports relating to 

energy consumption in mills and refineries (pages 25-26) 

and the resulting GHG emissions (page 27), arising from 

alignment of calculation methods across the Group [GRI 

102-48]. We have also restated our pesticide consumption 

data (page 25) from previous reports to standardise the 

scope of pesticides included.

Workers with high incidence or high risk of 

diseases related to their occupation 

Some tasks such as harvesting and tapping are subject to inherent risk of 

exposure to some tropical diseases; but the workforce is accustomed to 

managing the risks, and there are mitigation proedures to manage the risks; 

so we can state that the risk is not 'high'.

403-4

Health and safety topics covered in formal 

agreements with trade unions 

The Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) covers safety, with reference to 

proper PPE for field workers, an OHS Trustee Committee, training, and 

grievance mechanisms (we opt not to express 'coverage' as a percentage). 

Periodic workplace inspection, safety audit, and accident evaluations are 

also completed with employee representatives. In line with SMK3, we have 

Policies for strict compliance on PPE. This is also stated in the CLA.
