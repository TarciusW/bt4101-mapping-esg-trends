Letter to Our Stakeholders

GRI 102-14

Dear Stakeholders,

Keppel turns 50 in 2018. Starting from 

humble beginnings as a ship repair yard 

in Singapore, we have grown to become 

a multi-business company driven by a 

common purpose to provide solutions for 

sustainable urbanisation, while creating 

value for our stakeholders and improving 

lives wherever we operate. 

Sustainability is at the heart of our business 

and we carefully consider environmental, 

social and governance issues in the 

determination of our strategy and policies. 

Our approach to sustainability starts with our 

goal to run a profitable, safe and responsible 

business providing the best value 

proposition to customers, while guided by 

our core values and operating principles. 

Corporate Citizenship in a  

Global Context

This year, Keppel Corporation became a 

signatory of the United Nations Global 

Compact, the world's largest corporate 

sustainability initiative to mobilise a global 

movement of sustainable companies. 

We are committed to the Compact’s 10 

universal principles on human rights, labour, 

environment and anti-corruption, which 

resonate strongly with our own core values. 

We are also committed to working towards 

the achievement of the Sustainable 

Development Goals, which reflect a globally 

shared ambition to improve life, in a 

sustainable way, for future generations.  

In this report, we have shared the different 

ways in which Keppel contributes towards 

advancing these global goals.

The Paris Agreement has been ratified 

by more than 170 countries, and climate 

change is a key topic on the international 

agenda. The Singapore government has 

also stepped up efforts to lower the nation’s 

environmental impact through various 

measures, including the introduction of a 

carbon tax targeting large direct emitters of 

Greenhouse Gases.

Keppel is committed to support efforts 

by the international community and the 

Singapore government in tackling climate 

change. In 2014, we announced our target 

of achieving a 16% improvement in carbon 

emissions from 2020 business-as-usual 

levels. In 2017, we evaluated the Group’s 

progress towards this goal based on carbon 

emissions intensity, and affirmed that we are 

on track to achieve this target. 

In addition, we have set a longer term target 

of achieving a 28.8% reduction in carbon 

emissions intensity by 2030, from 2010 

levels, in our global operations. The new 

target is aligned with Singapore's national 

We are a multi-business company driven 

by a common purpose to provide solutions 

for sustainable urbanisation, while creating 

value for our stakeholders and improving 

lives wherever we operate.

Group Overview


target, announced in 2015. We are pleased 

to share that as at end 2017, our operations 

in Singapore, which account for 80% of the 

Group’s total emissions, have achieved 

a 27.7% cumulative average reduction in 

emissions intensity from our 2010 baseline. 

Energy efficiency initiatives implemented 

across the Group in 2017, including  

Keppel Land’s Green Mark-certified 

developments, are estimated to have saved 

650,144 GJ of energy, equivalent to 7.1% 

of the Group’s total energy consumption, 

during the year. This translates to an 

estimated $37 million in cost savings, and an 

avoidance of approximately 77,000 tonnes 

of carbon dioxide emissions. Cumulatively, 

the Group has saved over 2.3 million GJ 

of energy over the past five years, which 

translates to a total of about $140 million 

in cost savings, and an avoidance of over 

280,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide  

emissions over this period.

Keppel has also continued to promote the 

use of renewable energy. Keppel Offshore 

&amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) and Keppel 

Infrastructure are collaborating on a solar 

leasing project at Keppel O&amp;M’s yards, 

where the renewable energy generated will 

help offset the yards’ energy requirements. 

In addition, some of the renewable energy 

certificates generated through this initiative 

will be transferred to Keppel Corporation, 

allowing our corporate office at Keppel Bay 

Tower to be fully powered by clean energy 

starting from the end of 2018.

Our licence to operate requires us to act 

within clear legal and ethical boundaries. 

As we grow our business in this increasingly 

complex global landscape, we need to 

conduct ourselves according to the highest 

ethical standards. Last December,  

Keppel O&amp;M reached a global resolution 

with criminal authorities in the US, Brazil and 

Singapore over the illegal payments made 

by Keppel O&amp;M’s former agent in Brazil, 

which were made with the knowledge or 

approval of former Keppel O&amp;M executives. 

This brings closure to a painful chapter for 

Keppel. We have put in place significant 

enhancements to the compliance and 

internal controls systems across the Group to 

ensure that this does not happen again. The 

past practices uncovered do not reflect how 

Keppel conducts business today. We do not 

and will not tolerate any illegal activity in the 

conduct of our business, and are committed 

to winning business legally and ethically. 

Valuing Our Stakeholders

Our people are our most valuable asset.  

We respect and uphold human rights 

principles, adhere to fair employment 

practices, and are committed to nurture 

and empower a diverse, competent and 

dedicated talent pool to drive Keppel’s 

further growth. This year, we invested over 

500,000 hours training our employees, 

including leveraging e-learning platforms  

for faster and better reach.

Keppel has a robust Health, Safety and 

Environment Policy, which all our employees 

and suppliers are expected to abide by. While 

we have made good progress in our safety 

journey, sadly, we lost three of our colleagues 

during the year. We have investigated these 

incidents thoroughly and rigorously, and 

instituted measures to prevent recurrence. 

We will soldier on in our efforts to ensure that 

everyone goes home safe, every day.

To integrate Keppel’s sustainability principles 

across our supply chain, we established the 

Keppel Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct 

at the end of 2016. Suppliers of Keppel 

Group companies are expected to abide 

by the Code, which covers areas pertaining 

to business conduct, environmental 

management, labour practices, as well as 

safety and health. In 2017, close to 74% of 

our qualified suppliers signed the Code, and 

we are working towards bringing the other 

qualified suppliers on board.

Wherever we operate, we are focused 

on making a difference in the wider 

community, be it through working with the 

underprivileged, promoting education or 

caring for the environment. 

Keppel Volunteers clocked about  

12,000 hours of volunteer work in 2017, 

and brought cheer to more than 1,000 

beneficiaries. Our outreach efforts have 

positively touched lives not only in Singapore, 

but in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil, 

among other countries. I would like to 

acknowledge and thank all our volunteers  

for their dedication.

In partnership with organisations that 

share our values, we commit up to 1% of 

the Group’s net profit to worthy social and 

environmental causes. These contributions 

are coordinated and disbursed by Keppel 

Care Foundation, the Group’s philanthropic 

arm. The Foundation has disbursed close  

to $30 million to worthy causes since its 

launch in 2012.

The Keppel Discovery Wetlands at the 

Singapore Botanic Gardens, restored with 

Keppel’s contribution, was officially opened by  

Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong 

in March 2017. This restored and beautiful 

freshwater forest wetland in the heart of the 

city has attracted over 600,000 visitors so far. 

Shaping a Better Tomorrow

We are encouraged that our sustainability 

efforts have been internationally recognised. 

Keppel was awarded Best Workforce, and 

received Special Recognition for Strategy 

and Sustainability Management, at the 

Sustainable Business Awards Singapore. 

We were also awarded the Sustainability 

Award at the Securities Investors Association 

Singapore 18th Investors' Choice Awards and 

conferred the title Champion of Good by the 

National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre.

Keppel has been a part of the widely 

respected Dow Jones Sustainability Index 

for five consecutive years, and continued to 

be listed among the top 10 constituents of 

the Singapore Exchange’s Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) Indices – the 

SGX ESG Leaders Index and the SGX ESG 

Transparency Index. We are also listed  

on a number of other sustainability indices 

and rankings, including MSCI World ESG 

Leaders Index and Euronext Vigeo Eiris  

Index – World 120.

We are excited about the many 

opportunities presented by strong 

urbanisation trends across our businesses, 

and have made steps to position Keppel  

well for the future. In 2018, we established 

Keppel Technology &amp; Innovation (KTI) to 

promote innovation and enterprise in 

the Group. Whether it is to develop new 

products and services, improve existing 

ones or to innovate and enhance business 

models and ways of working, KTI is a 

platform for all our business units and  

teams to co-create and incubate ideas 

towards tangible outcomes.

We are also grooming a new generation  

of employees who are committed to  

our core values and operating principles,  

and at the same time, are innovative, 

collaborative and nimble. We are 

harmonising our corporate and human 

resources systems, which will allow us to 

reap efficiencies and improve controls.  

We seek to create a conducive workplace 

where employees can explore, develop  

and fulfil their professional aspirations,  

and at the same time help Keppel achieve  

its mission to provide solutions for 

sustainable urbanisation. 

Recognising business opportunities that 

help our company grow, while addressing 

societal challenges, will be vital to our  

long-term success. In collaboration with  

our stakeholders, we will stride forward  

in confidence to take Keppel to the  

next chapter.

Group Overview


Our materiality assessments 

are based on principles of 

inclusivity, materiality and 

completeness. 

is maintained. HSE teams across the 

various business units play an active role in 

enhancing the safety culture within the Group 

and ensuring that our businesses comply with 

HSE legislation as well as Group HSE policies 

and standards.

R K Jaggi, Keppel Corporation’s General 

Manager of Group HSE, leads the coordination 

of safety efforts across the Group. 

The implementation of our Group-wide 

carbon management strategy is led by the 

Energy Efficiency Committee, which is chaired 

by Cindy Lim, Keppel Corporation’s Director 

of Group Corporate Development, and 

Managing Director of Keppel Urban Solutions. 

The committee sets targets, evaluates the 

effectiveness of our carbon management 

efforts, and monitors and reports on 

performance. It comprises representatives 

from business units, many of whom are 

certified energy managers. 

Keppel Care Foundation coordinates 

philanthropic giving across the Group.  

The Foundation is governed by its own Board 

of Directors, and chaired by Lee Boon Yang, 

Chairman of Keppel Corporation. 

Materiality 

GRI 102-46

Materiality assessments are important 

components of Keppel’s sustainability 

strategy and reporting. 

Our materiality assessments were based 

on the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 

of Inclusivity and Materiality, as well as the 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Principles 

for Defining Report Content – stakeholder 

inclusiveness, sustainability context, 

materiality and completeness.

Materiality with respect to sustainability 

reporting, as defined by GRI Standards, 

includes topics and indicators that  

reflect the organisation’s significant 

economic, environmental, and social 

impacts; and would substantively  

influence the assessments and decisions  

of stakeholders. 

Process 

A robust process was undertaken to  

identify and prioritise the Company’s 

material ESG issues. 

The process was supported by an 

independent consultant and involved 

stakeholder consultations, workshops for 

senior management, an assessment of  

long-term global trends and an internal 

review of our businesses. 

In 2017, the material ESG issues for Keppel 

Corporation were reviewed at the annual 

Group Sustainability Working Committee 

meeting, where all eight working groups 

were present. The material ESG issues  

were also reviewed by the Steering 

Committee and Keppel Corporation’s  

Board of Directors and deemed to  

remain relevant.

Keppel Corporation Limited |  Sustainability Report 2017


Sustainable Development Goals

GRI 102-12 / 102-15

Keppel is committed to the international community's sustainable development 

agenda, and will leverage collaboration and partnership to support the global goals.

Keppel believes that businesses can play 

an important role in the achievement 

of the Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development. We firmly believe that a 

company that is aligned with the global 

sustainable development agenda can not 

only enhance its social licence to operate, 

but also improve the sustainability, efficiency 

and competitiveness of its business. 

Having reviewed how our different 

businesses can contribute to each of the 

SDGs, we have incorporated the goals where 

appropriate, as a supporting framework to 

shape and guide our sustainability strategy. 

In this report, we share how different 

activities of the Keppel Group contribute 

towards ten of these goals. 

Building Sustainable Cities

Keppel’s suite of solutions for energy, 

infrastructure, clean environments, high 

quality homes and offices, and connectivity 

can help countries maintain a balance 

between the trend of rapid urbanisation  

and the focus on sustainability.

More than half the world’s population  

live in urban settlements and this number  

is projected to rise to 60% by 2030 1. 

Buildings and construction together  

account for 36% of global final energy 

use and 39% of energy-related carbon 

emissions2. In addition, studies have  

shown that green buildings enhance 

occupant health, well-being and 

productivity, which in turn deliver business 

value for building owners and investors. It is  

therefore important to pay attention to  

the built environment.

The rapid deployment of energy-efficient 

and low-carbon solutions for buildings and 

construction can help put the world on a 

sustainable trajectory.

As one of Asia’s premier property 

companies, Keppel Land is focused on 

developing properties that harmonise with 

the environment, and adopts a holistic and 

proactive approach towards environmental 

management. The company undertakes 

rigorous measures to ensure that both 

new and existing developments comply 

with regulatory requirements, and are 

aligned with internationally-recognised 

environmental guidelines. For all completed 

commercial buildings in Singapore,  

Keppel Land has achieved its goal of 

achieving at least the BCA Green Mark 

GoldPLUS standard. The company has 

garnered a total of 75 BCA Green Mark 

Awards to date (see pages 52 and 53). 

Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation continues to focus on  

energy efficiency and reliability in its  

data centre portfolio. The company’s  

data centre facilities in Singapore are 

certified with the Singapore Standard for 

Green Data Centres, and utilise a host of  

energy-efficient solutions to improve  

power usage effectiveness. 

In 2017, Keppel Data Centres invested  

US$10 million in Nautilus Data Technologies, 

a Californian startup currently developing  

a commercial water-cooled data centre, 

which will significantly increase cooling 

efficiency and reduce operating costs  

(see page 49). In the Logistics business,  

the company continues to harness 

technology, such as enhanced route 

planning, to minimise travelling distance  

and reduce fuel wastage. 

Keppel Capital, Keppel’s asset management 

arm, manages different asset classes, from 

energy and infrastructure to real estate. 

Keppel Capital seeks to conduct business 

responsibly, and this includes enhancing and 

improving the environmental performance 

of its property and infrastructure assets 

through the incorporation of green features 

where feasible. 

Keppel has a strong track record in large-scale 

urban development, and Keppel Urban 

Solutions (KUS) was established in 2017 to 

integrate the Group’s different capabilities, 

and work with like-minded partners to 

capture opportunities in the urbanisation 

megatrend as a master developer of  

large-scale projects. 

KUS’ capabilities will be applied in its pilot 

project, Saigon Sports City, a 64-hectare 

township that Keppel Land is developing 

in the prime District 2 of Ho Chi Minh City, 

Vietnam. Saigon Sports City is envisaged  

to be a bustling hub, combining  

high-quality urban living with modern 

healthy lifestyle concepts.

The Keppel Group is also leading the 

Singapore Consortium in the development 

of the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City  

(Eco-City). This is a high-level project 

between the governments of Singapore  

and China to develop a sustainable city 

which can be a model for sustainable 

urbanisation in other Chinese cities.  

Now into its 10th year of development,  

the Eco-City has transformed from a barren, 

saline and alkaline site to an emerging  

green city, where over 80,000 people 

live and work. The Eco-City was named 

China’s first National Green Development 

Demonstration Zone, first Integrated Smart-

Grid Demonstration Zone and a National 

Green Building Base (see pages 58 and 59).

Enhancing Access to Clean Energy

The demand for energy will grow as cities 

continue to undergo urbanisation. Solutions 

in our energy portfolio focus on enhancing 

access to energy. With climate change as a 

growing international concern, demand for 

cleaner sources of energy such as Liquefied 

Natural Gas (LNG) is expected to rise.  

LNG is considered to be one of the safest 

and cleanest fossil fuels available, and offers 

significant potential for industries to  

reduce GHG emissions.

As one of the world’s leaders in LNG  

vessel repair, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

(Keppel O&amp;M) has built up critical knowledge 

for handling materials at extremely low 

temperatures. This experience, coupled with 

a strong track record in oil and gas projects, 

has enabled Keppel to achieve many firsts 

in the delivery of LNG solutions, including 

completing the world’s first FLNG vessel 

conversion, Hilli Episeyo, for Golar LNG.  

Our ability to offer end-to-end solutions  

has also primed Keppel to meet rising 

demand for LNG in archipelagic markets 

unserved by gas pipelines. In 2017,  

Keppel O&amp;M signed a Heads of Agreement 

with Pavilion Energy and PLN to explore  

the development of small-scale LNG 

solutions for West Indonesia. Keppel O&amp;M's 

value proposition extends beyond a  

typical engineering, procurement and 

construction shipyard. With the ability to 

design, develop and integrate solutions 

across the gas value chain, Keppel is  

poised to be the gas industry’s preferred 

partner and enabler.

Keppel Infrastructure's Energy Infrastructure 

Division provides competitive energy 

solutions and services across the natural  

gas value chain through its subsidiaries

Group Overview


Keppel Gas, Pipenet and Keppel DHCS.  

The Keppel Merlimau Cogen plant uses 

natural gas to generate electricity.  

Gas-fired plants have significantly lower 

carbon emissions than oil-fired steam plants. 

Keppel has continued to promote the  

use of renewable energy. The Keppel DHCS 

district cooling system plant at Changi 

Business Park and the Keppel Seghers Ulu 

Pandan NEWater Plant feature rooftop  

solar power installations that are among  

the largest in Singapore. The Keppel DHCS 

plant in the Eco-City also taps geothermal 

energy to supplement the plant’s energy 

needs. In addition, Keppel O&amp;M and  

Keppel Infrastructure are currently 

collaborating on a solar leasing project at 

Keppel O&amp;M’s yards, where the renewable 

energy generated will help offset the 

yards’ energy requirements. Some of the 

renewable energy certificates generated 

through this initiative will be transferred to 

Keppel Corporation, allowing our corporate 

office at Keppel Bay Tower to be fully 

powered by clean energy starting from  

the end of 2018. 

Innovating Water &amp; Waste 

Management Technology

Keppel Infrastructure taps the advanced 

technology solutions of its subsidiary,  

Keppel Seghers, to address a wide spectrum 

of environmental issues in solid waste and 

wastewater management. With a strong 

track record in implementing water and 

waste management projects in Europe, 

North and South America, Asia Pacific,  

Africa and the Middle East, Keppel is  

well-positioned to meet the challenges  

of building a cleaner world. 

Waste-to-energy (WTE) plants by  

Keppel generate green energy from waste 

and help in landfill diversion by as much 

as 90% through reduction in the volume 

of waste disposed. We have implemented 

our proven and patented WTE technologies 

in more than 100 state-of-the-art facilities 

around the world. In 2017, Keppel Seghers 

and Zhen Hua Engineering jointly secured  

a contract to design, build and operate  

Hong Kong’s first Integrated Waste 

Management Facility (IWMF). The landmark 

project will play a key role in Hong Kong’s 

waste management strategy. In China, 

Keppel Seghers also continued to build  

on its track record as a leading imported 

WTE technology solutions provider. It 

secured two contracts in 2017, bringing 

its technology packages under execution 

in China to nine projects with a total 

incineration capacity of close to 16,500 

tonnes per day.

Keppel’s advanced water solutions cover 

the full water cycle, including wastewater 

treatment, process and drinking water, 

desalination and water reuse. We have 

implemented more than 350 water and 

wastewater treatment projects globally to 

date. Keppel has designed, built and is now 

operating two landmark projects that serve 

the environmental needs of Qatar – the Doha 

North Sewage Treatment Works (DNSTW), 

which recycles wastewater and treats sludge 

for agricultural reuse, and the Domestic Solid 

Waste Management Centre, which treats 

municipal waste to generate green energy. 

The DNSTW received regional accolades 

including the GCC Award for Sustainability 

and the GCC Water Project of the Year at the 

MEED Quality Awards 2017.

In 2017, KeppeI Infrastructure commenced 

construction for Singapore’s first large-scale 

dual-mode desalination plant, the Keppel 

Marina East Desalination Plant, which is able 

to treat both seawater and freshwater. Slated 

for completion in 2020, the Plant will help 

bolster Singapore’s water supply resilience.

Valuing Our People 

Our businesses spark economic growth, 

productivity and jobs. In 2017, Keppel’s 

businesses generated $6.6 billion in 

economic value. This includes revenue, 

interest and investment income, and 

disposal gains. Over $1 billion was paid  

out in employee wages and benefits,  

and $322 million was paid to governments  

in the form of income taxes. 

More than 20,000 people in over  

20 countries work at Keppel. They are 

supported by an inclusive culture that  

allows them to maximise their potential.  

Our hiring policies ensure equal 

employment opportunities for all. 

We are committed to nurture human  

capital, and make investments to equip  

our employees with up-to-date skills  

and certifications. We also partner 

government bodies and educational 

institutions on initiatives targeted at 

grooming young talents. 

Improving Occupational  

Safety &amp; Health

Safety is a core value at Keppel, and an 

integral part of our business. We are 

committed to provide a safe and healthy 

workplace for all our stakeholders, and  

focus on strengthening our frameworks  

and management systems as well as 

promoting a culture of safety ownership 

across our operations.

In 2017, we invested approximately  

$28 million in enhancing safety 

infrastructure, upgrading systems and 

building knowledge and skillsets across 

the Group. We also support national 

and industry-related initiatives to raise 

safety standards, and members of 

Keppel’s management team sit on various 

committees of the Workplace Safety  

and Health (WSH) Council and related 

industry associations. Keppel has been a 

regular sponsor of annual national safety 

events, including the 2017 edition of the 

WSH Awards. 

The Keppel Safety Training Centre at  

Keppel Shipyard in Singapore offers a 

complete range of safety training and 

certification courses in both trade specific 

and broad-based skills for all levels of the 

workforce. Keppel Land’s Safety Awareness 

Centres in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Johor 

Bahru, Malaysia; and Jakarta, Indonesia, 

provide mandatory training for contractors’ 

employees and promote a culture of safety 

across Keppel Land’s supply chain.  

Keppel Land opened its first Safety 

Awareness Centre in Tianjin, China,  

in 2017. The centre is the first in China  

to be built by a developer.

Ensuring Compliance

Given the geographical diversity of our 

businesses, we closely monitor developments 

in the laws and regulations of countries 

where the Group operates to ensure that our 

businesses and operations comply with all 

relevant laws and regulations. We regularly 

engage with local government authorities 

and agencies to keep abreast of changes 

to laws and regulations. We recognise that 

non-compliance with laws and regulations 

not only has significant financial impact but 

potentially detrimental reputational impact 

on the Group. We are fully committed to 

strengthening our regulatory compliance 

framework. Our emphasis is clear and 

consistently reiterated. We have zero 

tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption  

and violation of laws and regulations. 

During the year, we continued to make 

significant progress on our regulatory 

compliance initiatives, ensuring that 

compliance principles are embedded in our 

activities and implementing best practices 

from industry leaders as we develop and 

strengthen our compliance framework  

(see Keppel Corporation’s Report to 

Shareholders 2017 pages 75 to 77).

businesses, and we work closely with our 

suppliers to make a positive impact on  

their sustainability performance. 

We adhere to local content requirements 

and are committed towards strengthening 

our base of local suppliers in countries 

where we operate. In doing so, we support 

domestic economic growth, generate 

employment opportunities and improve  

the capacities of the workforce in our  

host countries. 

All suppliers are qualified in accordance  

with our requisition and purchasing policies, 

and screened based on environmental  

and social criteria. We review potential 

suppliers’ industry reputation, track 

record, financial performance, security 

practices and certifications, whereby

and Portugese. 

All new suppliers that provide Keppel with 

products and services valued at $200,000 

or more per contract or over cumulative 

purchase orders in the prior calendar year 

are expected to sign and abide by the  

Code, which covers areas pertaining 

to business conduct, labour practices, 

safety and health, and environmental 

management. All Group companies are 

required to include the acknowledgment 

and signing of the code as part of their

Sustaining Growth




Overview

Today, more than half of the world’s 

population live in urban areas. According 

to estimates by the United Nations, urban 

areas are projected to house 60% of people 

globally by 20301. 

We live in a rapidly changing and evolving 

world. Growing digitalisation, advances 

in artificial intelligence and robotics, will 

redefine the way people live, work, play,  

and interact with one another. Companies 

must likewise adapt to the changing 

environment to stay relevant and ahead  

of competitors. 

Strong urbanisation growth presents a 

multitude of opportunities for businesses. 

At the same time, new disruptive technology 

and business models are shaking up  

long-standing businesses, and threaten  

to derail others. 

Amidst these trends, Keppel strives to 

become a stronger, more innovative and 

more sustainable company, with different 

business units collaborating to harness 

synergies in providing solutions for 

sustainable urbanisation.

Financial Performance in 2017

GRI 419-1

For FY 2017, the Group achieved a net profit 

of $217 million, after taking into account the 

one-off financial penalty of $570 million, 

arising from Keppel O&amp;M’s global resolution 

with criminal authorities in the US, Brazil  

and Singapore, and $49 million of related 

legal, accounting and forensics costs. 

Excluding these one-off items, the Group 

would have achieved a net profit of  

$836 million, an increase of 7% over  

FY 2016, underpinned by earnings  

growth in the Property, Infrastructure  

and Investments Divisions.

to ensure that all material information is 

provided in a timely manner to the Board 

for the Board to make good decisions. He 

also encourages constructive relations 

between the Board and management, and 

between the executive and non-executive 

directors.  At annual general meetings and 

other shareholders’ meetings, the Chairman 

ensures constructive dialogue between 

shareholders, the Board and management. 

The Chairman takes a leading role in the 

Company’s drive to achieve and maintain a 

high standard of corporate governance with 

the full support of the directors, Company 

Secretaries and management.

To assist the Board in the discharge of 

its oversight function, various board 

committees, namely the Audit, Board Risk, 

Nominating, Remuneration, and Board 

Safety Committees, have been constituted 

with clear written terms of reference. All the 

board committees are actively engaged 

and play an important role in ensuring good 

corporate governance in the Company and 

within the Group.

The CEO, assisted by the management 

team, makes strategic proposals to the 

Board and after robust and constructive 

board discussion, executes the agreed 

strategy, manages and develops the 

Group’s businesses and implements the 

Board’s decisions.  He is supported by 

management committees that direct and 

guide management on operational policies 

and activities, which include:

(1) Investments &amp; Major Projects Action 

Committee (IMPAC), which guides the 

Group to exercise the spirit of enterprise 

as well as prudence to earn optimal  

risk-adjusted returns on invested  

capital for our chosen lines of business, 

taking into consideration the risks,  

in a controlled manner; 

(2) Management Development Committee 

(MDC), which nominates candidates 

as nominee directors to the boards of 

each unlisted company or entity that 

the Company is invested in (“Investee 

Company”) so as to safeguard the 

Company’s investment. In respect of 

Investee Companies that are (a) listed 

on a stock exchange, (b) managers 

or trustee-managers of any collective 

investment schemes, business trusts 

or any other trusts which are listed on a 

stock exchange, or (c) parent companies 

of the Company’s core businesses, 

the Committee will recommend the 

candidates for the approval of the 

Nominating Committee. The MDC also 

provides inputs, guidance and direction 

on operational policies and human 

resources/organisational matters;

(3) Central Finance Committee, which 

reviews, guides and monitors  

financial  policies and activities  

of Group companies; 

(4) Risk and Compliance Committee (RCC), 

which drives and coordinates the 

Group’s risk management efforts,  

and leads in driving the Enterprise  

Risk Management framework and  

its processes; 

(5) Group Regulatory Compliance 

Management Committee (Group RCMC),  

which articulates the Group’s commitment 

to regulatory compliance, directs and 

supports the development of over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines,  

and facilitates the implementation and 

sharing of policies and procedures across 

the Group; 

(6) Group Regulatory Compliance Working 

Team (Group RCWT),  which supports 

the Group RCMC and oversees the 

development and review of over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines for 

the Group, as well as reviewing training 

and communication programmes;

(7) Keppel IT Steering Committee, which 

provides strategic information 

technology (IT) leadership and ensures  

IT strategy alignment in achieving 

business strategies; and

(8) Group Sustainability Steering Committee,  

which sets the sustainability strategy 

and leads performance in key  

focus areas. 

Board Strategic Review

The Board periodically reviews and approves 

the Group’s strategic plans. In FY2014, 

the Board approved the Group’s Vision 

20201 which sets out the vision, operating 

principles and values of the Group, and the 

roadmap2 to take the Group’s businesses 

into 2020 to achieve faster growth, build 

a stronger Keppel that fully captures the 

significant synergies within and among its 

Group companies, and fully develop the 

potential of its people. 

Review Process 

A process is in place to support the Board 

in reviewing and monitoring the Group’s 

strategic plans, including providing directors 

with the necessary context and opportunity 

to undertake effective and robust deliberation 

and debate. In this regard, a two-day off-

site board strategy meeting is organised 

annually for in-depth discussion on strategic 

issues and direction of the Group. This is 

followed by an update of each business 

unit’s strategic plans for alignment with the 

Group’s strategy. To support the Board’s 

oversight of the implementation of the 

strategic plans, one business unit is invited 

to each quarterly Board meeting to present 

on its plans and current challenges, and to 

provide the Board an opportunity to perform 

an in-depth review into each of the Group’s  

core businesses.

An Effective Board 

GRI 102-24 / 102-25 / 102-27 / 102-28

Our Board fully understands that they must 

act in the best interest of the Company at all 

times, are accountable to the shareholders 

and have the responsibility to safeguard 

the interests of all shareholders. In this 

aspect, the Board and management fully 

appreciate that fundamental to good 

corporate governance is an effective and 

robust Board whose members engage in 

open and constructive debate and challenge 

management on its assumptions  

and proposals.

Independence of Directors

There is a strong and independent  

element on our Board, with an independent 

chairman and majority of our Board 

comprising independent directors. 

Except for the Board Safety Committee, 

all board committees comprised entirely 

independent or non-executive directors, 

with independent chairmen. 

The independence of the directors are 

reviewed by the Nominating Committee 

(“NC”) on an annual basis, bearing in 

mind the 2012 Code’s definition of an 

“independent director” and guidance as to 

relationships the existence of which would 

deem a director not to be independent. 

The NC carried out the review on the 

independence of each non-executive 

director in January 2017 based on the 

respective directors’ self-declaration in  

1 

With effect from FY2014, and following a review and update in FY 2017, the vision of the Company is to be a global company at the forefront of its chosen industries, 

shaping the future for the benefit of all its stakeholders – Sustaining Growth, Empowering Lives and Nurturing Communities. Guided by our operating principles and core 

values, the Company’s mission is to deliver our solutions for sustainable urbanisation profitably, safely and responsibly.

2 

This roadmap includes four broad areas for sustainable growth: (1) Business: Setting the overarching strategies, targets, and key actions to be undertaken by the 

business units; (2) People: Building a robust succession pipeline and continued strong employee satisfaction; (3) Process: Pursuing excellence in safety, productivity and 

innovation; and (4) Corporate Citizenry: Formalising and further organising community outreach efforts to positively impact communities in which the Group operates.

Corporate Governance

Sustaining Growth


the Directors’ Independence Checklist and 

their actual performance on the Board and 

board committees.  

Independent Judgment

All directors are expected to exercise 

independent judgment in the best 

interests of the Company. This is one of 

the performance criteria for the peer and 

self-assessment on the effectiveness of the 

individual directors. Based on the results of 

the peer and self-assessment carried out by 

the directors for FY 2017, all directors have 

discharged this duty consistently well.

Conflict of Interest

Every director is required to declare any 

conflict of interest in a transaction or 

proposed transaction with the Company  

as soon as is practicable after the relevant 

facts have come to his/her knowledge. 

On an annual basis, each director is also 

required to submit details of his/her 

associates for the purpose of monitoring 

interested persons transactions.

Board Competency &amp; Diversity

The competencies and skill sets of the 

directors and the composition of the Board 

play a role in the overall effectiveness of 

the Board. At Keppel, the NC ensures that 

the Board and board committees comprise 

directors who, as a group, provide core 

competencies required to exercise effective 

oversight and direction. 

The NC is satisfied that the Board and the 

board committees comprise directors who, 

as a group, provide an appropriate balance 

and diversity of skills, experience, gender, 

knowledge of the Group, core competencies 

such as accounting or finance, business or 

management experience, human resource, 

risk management, technology, mergers  

and acquisitions, legal, international 

perspective, industry knowledge, strategic 

planning experience and customer-based 

experience or knowledge, required for  

the Board and the board committees to  

be effective.

In this respect, the NC recognises the 

merits of gender diversity in relation to the 

composition of the Board and, in identifying 

suitable candidates for new appointment 

to the Board, would ensure that female 

candidates are included for consideration. 

Having said that, gender is but one aspect of 

diversity and new directors will continue to 

be selected based on objective criteria set as 

part of the process for appointment of new 

directors and Board succession planning. In 

FY 2017, there was one female director out of 

a total of nine directors.

Board Information

To effectively engage the management, 

the Board, in particular, the non-executive 

directors, must be kept well-informed of 

the Company’s business and affairs and 

be knowledgeable about the industry in 

which the businesses operate. The Company 

has therefore adopted initiatives to put in 

place processes to ensure that the non-

executive directors are well supported by 

accurate, complete and timely information, 

have unrestricted access to management, 

and have sufficient time and resources 

to discharge their oversight function 

effectively. These initiatives include regular 

informal meetings for management to 

brief the directors on prospective deals and 

potential developments at an early stage 

before formal board approval is sought, and 

the circulation of relevant information on 

business initiatives, industry developments, 

and analyst and press commentaries on 

matters in relation to the Company or the 

industries in which it operates. A two-day  

off-site board strategy meeting is organised 

annually for in-depth discussion on 

strategic issues and direction of the Group, 

to give the non-executive directors a 

better understanding of the Group and its 

businesses, and to provide an opportunity 

for the non-executive directors to familiarise 

themselves with the management team 

so as to facilitate the Board’s review of the 

Group’s succession planning and leadership 

development programme.

Training

The directors are provided with continuing 

education in areas such as directors’ 

duties and responsibilities, corporate 

governance, changes in financial reporting 

standards, changes in the Companies 

Act, continuing listing obligations and 

industry-related matters, so as to update 

and refresh them on matters that may affect 

or enhance their performance as board 

or board committee members. A training 

programme is also in place for directors 

in areas such as accounting, finance, risk 

governance and management, the roles 

and responsibilities of a director of a listed 

company and industry specific matters. In 

FY2017, some KCL directors attended talks 

on topics relating to corporate governance 

and compliance (including case studies), 

sanctions, financial reporting updates and 

macroeconomic trends. Site visits are also 

conducted periodically for directors to 

familiarise them with the operations of  

the various businesses, so as to enhance 

their performance as board or board 

committee members. 

Board Evaluation

Our Board has implemented formal 

processes for assessing the effectiveness 

of the Board as a whole and its board 

committees, the contribution by each 

individual director to the effectiveness of 

the Board, as well as the effectiveness of the 

Chairman of the Board. 

To ensure that the assessments are  

done promptly and fairly, the Board  

has appointed an independent third  

party (the “Independent Co-ordinator”)  

to assist in collating and analysing  

the returns of the board members.  

Mrs Fang Ai Lian, former Chairman,  

Ernst &amp; Young and Great Eastern Holdings 

Ltd, and currently Advisor to Far East 

Organisation, was appointed for this role. 

Mrs Fang Ai Lian does not have business 

relationships or any other connections 

with the Company which may affect her 

independent judgment.

Board Composition &amp;  

Succession Planning 

There is a process of refreshing the 

Board progressively over time so that the 

experience of longer serving directors can 

be drawn upon while tapping into new 

external perspectives and insights of more 

recent appointees. The Board believes that 

orderly succession and renewal is achieved 

as a result of careful planning, where the 

appropriate composition of the Board is 

continually under review.

The NC is responsible for reviewing the 

succession plans for the Board. In this 

regard, it has put in place a formal process 

for the renewal of the Board and the 

selection of new directors. The NC leads 

the process and makes recommendations 

to the Board as follows:

(1) NC reviews annually the balance  

and diversity of skills, experience,  

gender and knowledge required  

by the Board and the size of the  

Board which would facilitate  

decision-making.

(2)  In the light of such review and in 

consultation with management,  

the NC assesses if there is any 

inadequate representation in  

respect of any of those attributes  

and if so, determines the role and  

the desirable competencies for a 

particular appointment. 

(3)  External help (for example, from the  

Singapore Institute of Directors, 

search consultants, or through open 

advertisement) may be used to source 

for potential candidates if need be.  

Directors and management may also 

make recommendations.

(4)  NC meets with the short-listed 

candidate(s) to assess suitability and 

to ensure that the candidate(s) is/are 

aware of the expectations and the 

level of commitment required.

(5)  NC makes recommendations to the 

Board for approval.

31

Keppel Corporation Limited |  Sustainability Report 2017


All new appointments are subject to the 

recommendation of the NC based on the 

following objective criteria:

(1) Integrity

(2) Independent mindedness

(3) Diversity – Possess core competencies 

that meet the needs of the Company 

and complement the skills and 

competencies of the existing directors 

on the Board

(4) Able to commit time and effort to carry 

out duties and responsibilities effectively 

(5) Track record of making good decisions

(6) Experience in high-performing 

companies

(7) Financially literate

The NC is also charged with the responsibility 

of re-nomination having regard to the 

director’s contribution and performance 

(such as attendance, preparedness, 

participation and candour), with reference 

to the results of the assessment of the 

performance of the individual director by 

his/her peers.

The directors submit themselves for 

re-nomination and re-election at regular 

intervals of at least once every three years. 

Pursuant to the Company’s constitution, 

one-third of the directors retire from office 

at the Company’s annual general meeting, 

and a newly appointed director must submit 

himself/herself for re-election at the annual 

general meeting immediately following  

his/her appointment.

Remuneration Framework

GRI 102-35 / 102-36 / 102-28

The Remuneration Committee (“RC”) is 

responsible for ensuring a formal and 

transparent procedure for developing  

policy on executive remuneration and  

for determining the remuneration  

packages of individual directors and  

senior management. The RC assists the 

Board to ensure that remuneration policies 

and practices are sound in that they are 

able to attract, retain and motivate without 

being excessive, and thereby maximise 

shareholder value. The RC recommends  

to the Board for endorsement a framework 

of remuneration (which covers all aspects 

of remuneration including directors’ fees, 

salaries, allowances, bonuses, grant of 

shares and benefits in kind) and the specific 

remuneration packages for each director 

and the key management personnel.  

The RC also reviews the remuneration of 

senior management and administers the 

KCL Share Option Scheme in respect of the 

outstanding options granted prior to the 

termination of the KCL Share Option Scheme 

in 2010, the KCL Restricted Share Plan 

(the “KCL RSP”) and the KCL Performance 

Share Plan (the “KCL PSP”). In addition, 

the RC reviews the Company’s obligations 

arising in the event of termination of the 

executive directors’ and key management 

personnel’s contract of service, to ensure 

that such contracts of service contain fair 

and reasonable termination clauses which 

are not overly generous.

To enhance objectivity, the RC comprises 

entirely non-executive directors, three out  

of four of whom (including the Chairman)  

are independent.  

The RC has access to expert advice from 

external remuneration consultants where 

required. In FY 2017, the RC sought views  

on market practice and trends from external 

remuneration consultants, Aon Hewitt.  

The RC undertook a review of the 

independence and objectivity of the 

external remuneration consultants through 

discussions with the external remuneration 

consultants, and has confirmed that the 

external remuneration consultants had no 

relationships with the Company which would 

affect their independence and objectivity.

Executive Director &amp; other Key 

Management Personnel

The Company advocates a performance-

based remuneration system that is highly 

flexible and responsive to the market, 

Company’s, business unit’s and individual 

employee’s performance and is aligned  

with shareholders’ interests. 

In designing the remuneration structure,  

the RC seeks to ensure that the level and  

mix of remuneration is competitive, 

relevant and appropriate in finding a 

balance between current versus long-term 

remuneration, and between cash versus 

equity incentive remuneration. 

In 2016/2017, the RC undertook a 

comprehensive review of the total 

remuneration structure. With the assistance 

of Aon Hewitt, the RC revised the total 

remuneration structure to reflect the 

following four key objectives:

(1) Shareholder Alignment: To incorporate 

performance measures that are aligned 

to shareholders’ interests

(2) Long-term Orientation: To motivate 

employees to drive sustainable long-

term growth

(3) Simplicity: To ensure that the 

remuneration structure is easy to 

understand and communicate to 

stakeholders 

(4) Synergy: To facilitate talent mobility and 

enhance collaboration across businesses

The revised total remuneration structure 

comprises three components; that is, annual 

fixed cash, annual performance bonus, 

and the KCL Share Plans. The annual fixed 

cash component comprises the annual 

basic salary plus any other fixed allowances, 

which the Company benchmarks with the 

relevant industry market median. The size of 

the Company’s annual performance bonus 

pot is determined by the Group’s financial 

and non-financial performance, and is 

distributed to employees based on their 

individual performance. The KCL Share Plans 

are in the form of two share plans approved 

by shareholders, the KCL RSP and the KCL PSP.  

A portion of the annual performance bonus 

is granted in the form of deferred shares that 

are awarded under the KCL RSP.  The KCL PSP 

comprises performance targets determined 

on an annual basis. The KCL RSP and KCL PSP 

are long term incentive plans which vest 

over a longer term horizon. Executives who 

have a greater ability to influence Group 

outcomes have a greater proportion of their 

overall remuneration at risk. 

 

The RC exercises broad discretion and 

independent judgement in ensuring that 

the amount and mix of remuneration is 

aligned with the interests of shareholders 

and promotes the long-term success of the 

Company. The mix of fixed and variable 

reward is considered appropriate for the 

Group and for each individual role. 

The remuneration structure is directly linked 

to corporate and individual performance, 

both in terms of financial and non-financial 

performance. This link is achieved in the 

following ways:

(1) by placing a significant portion of 

executives’ remuneration at risk  

(“At Risk component”) and subject to a 

vesting schedule; 

(2) by incorporating appropriate key 

performance indicators (“KPIs”) for 

awarding of annual performance bonus:

(i) There are four scorecard areas that 

the Company has identified as key  

to measuring the performance of  

the Group – (A) Financial and 

Business Drivers; (B) Process;  

(C) Stakeholders; and (D) People. 

Some of the key sub-targets within 

each of the scorecard areas include 

key financial indicators, safety goals, 

risk management, compliance and 

controls measures, corporate social 

responsibility activities, employee 

engagement, talent development 

and succession planning;

(ii) The four scorecard areas have been 

chosen because they support how 

the Group achieves its strategic 

objectives. The framework provides 

a link for staff to understand how 

they contribute to each area of 

the scorecard, and therefore to 

the Company’s overall strategic 

goals. This is designed to achieve 

a consistent approach and 

understanding across the Group. 

Corporate Governance

32

Sustaining Growth


The RC reviews and approves the 

scorecard annually;

(3) by selecting performance conditions 

for the KCL PSP awards, such as Total 

Shareholder Return, Return on Capital 

Employed and Net Profit that are aligned 

with shareholders' interests; 

(4) by requiring those KPIs or conditions 

to be met in order for the At Risk 

components of remuneration to be 

awarded or to vest; and

(5) by forfeiting the At Risk components  

of remuneration when those KPIs  

or conditions are not met at a 

satisfactory level.

The RC also recognises the need for a 

reasonable alignment between risk and 

remuneration to discourage excessive 

risk taking. Therefore, in determining the 

remuneration structure, the RC had taken 

into account the risk policies and risk 

tolerance of the Group as well as the  

time horizon of risks, and incorporated  

risk-adjustments into the remuneration 

structure through several initiatives, 

including but not limited to:

(1) prudent funding of annual  

performance bonus; 

(2) granting a portion of the annual 

performance bonus in the form of 

deferred shares, to be awarded under 

the KCL RSP;

(3) vesting of contingent share awards 

under the KCL PSP being subject to KPIs 

and/or performance conditions being 

met; and

(4) potential forfeiture of variable incentives 

in any year due to misconduct.

The RC is of the view that the overall level of 

remuneration is not considered to be at a 

level which is likely to promote behaviours 

contrary to the Group’s risk profile.

In determining the actual quantum of 

variable component of remuneration, the 

RC had taken into account the extent to 

which the performance conditions, set forth 

above, have been met. The RC is therefore 

of the view that remuneration is aligned to 

performance during FY 2017.

In order to align the interests of the 

executive director and key management 

personnel with that of shareholders, the 

executive director and key management 

personnel are remunerated partially in the 

form of shares in the Company and are 

encouraged to hold such shares while they 

remain in the employment of the Company. 

They are also required to hold a minimum 

number of shares under the share ownership 

guideline which requires them to maintain a 

beneficial ownership stake in the Company, 

thus further aligning their interests  

with shareholders.

The directors, the CEO and the key 

management personnel (who are not 

directors or the CEO) are remunerated on  

an earned basis and there are no 

termination, retirement and post-

employment benefits that are granted  

over and above what has been disclosed.

Non-Executive Directors

Each of the non-executive directors 

(including the Chairman) will receive 70%  

of his / her total directors’ fees in cash  

(“Cash Component”) and 30% in the form  

of KCL shares (“Remuneration Shares”)  

(both amounts subject to adjustment as 

described below). 

The actual number of Remuneration Shares, 

to be purchased from the market on the 

first trading day immediately after the date 

of the Annual General Meeting (“Trading 

Day”) for delivery to the respective non-

executive directors, will be based on the 

market price of the Company’s shares on the 

SGX on the Trading Day. The actual number 

of Remuneration Shares will be rounded 

down to the nearest thousand and any 

residual balance will be paid in cash. Such 

incorporation of an equity component in 

the total remuneration of the non-executive 

directors is intended to achieve the objective 

of aligning the interests of the non-executive 

directors with those of the shareholders’  

and the long term interests of the Company. 

The aggregate directors’ fees for 

non-executive directors is subject to 

shareholders’ approval at each annual 

general meeting.

Risk Management &amp; Internal Controls

GRI 102-11 / 102-17 / 102-33 / 205-2 / 419-1 

The Board, supported by the Audit 

Committee (“AC”) and Board Risk Committee 

(“BRC”), oversees the Keppel’s System of 

Management Controls Framework (the 

“Framework”), which outlines the Company’s 

internal control and risk management 

processes and procedures. 

The AC’s primary role is to assist the Board  

in ensuring the integrity of financial 

reporting and providing assurance that 

there is a sound system of internal controls 

in place. The BRC reviews and guides 

management in the formulation of risk 

policies and processes to effectively 

identify, evaluate and manage significant 

risks to safeguard shareholders’ interests 

and the Group’s assets. 

Keppel’s System of Management 

Controls Framework

The Framework outlines the Group’s  

internal control and risk management 

processes and procedures. The Framework 

comprises three Lines of Defence towards 

ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness  

33

Keppel Corporation Limited |  Sustainability Report 2017


Corporate Governance

of the Group’s system of internal controls 

and risk management.

Under the first Line of Defence, management 

is required to ensure good corporate 

governance through the implementation 

and management of policies and procedures 

relevant to the Group’s business scope and 

environment. Such policies and procedures 

govern financial, operational, information 

technology and regulatory compliance 

matters and are reviewed and updated 

periodically. Compliance governance is 

governed by the respective regulatory 

compliance management committees  

and working teams. Employees are also 

guided by the Group’s Core Values and 

expected to comply strictly with Keppel’s 

Code of Conduct.

Under the second Line of Defence, 

significant business units are required to 

conduct a self-assessment exercise on 

an annual basis. This exercise requires 

such business units to assess the status of 

their respective internal controls and risk 

management via self-assessment. Where 

required, action plans are developed to 

remedy identified control gaps. Under 

the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management 

Framework, significant risks areas of the 

Group are also identified and assessed,  

with systems, policies and processes put  

in place to manage and mitigate the 

identified risks. Regulatory Compliance 

supports and works alongside business 

management to ensure relevant policies, 

processes and controls are effectively 

designed, managed and implemented  

to ensure compliance risks and controls  

are effectively managed.

Under the third Line of Defence, to  

assist the Group to ascertain the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Group’s internal 

controls, business units are required to 

provide the Group with written assurances 

as to the adequacy and effectiveness 

of their system of internal controls and 

risk management. Such assurances are 

also sought from the Group’s internal 

and external auditors based on their 

independent assessments.

Enhanced Compliance Programme

In December 2017, a wholly owned 

subsidiary, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine Limited 

(“KOM”), reached a global resolution with 

the criminal authorities in the United States, 

Brazil and Singapore in relation to corrupt 

payments made by KOM’s former agent in 

Brazil, which were made with knowledge or 

approval of former KOM executives. 

An overview of the improvements and 

enhancements that has been made to 

strengthen Keppel’s compliance programme 

since 2015, following a review of our 

compliance programme, can be found  

from pages 75 to 77 of Keppel Corporation's 

Report to Shareholders 2017. The Company 

is committed to a continuous review of,

and where necessary and appropriate, 

further improvements and enhancements 

to the Group’s compliance programme  

will be made. 

Communication and Training 

The Group continuously ensures that 

its compliance policies and procedures 

are communicated effectively to all 

employees and directors. A mandatory 

e-training and assessment exercise 

covering all key policies, including  

Keppel’s Enhanced Code of Conduct, 

is carried out on an annual basis, and 

for FY2017, over 6,700 directors and 

employees have completed the e-training 

and assessment. 

Reporting and Investigation 

Keppel Whistle-Blower Policy (the 

“Policy”) took effect on 1 September 

2004 and was enhanced on 15 February 

2017 to encourage reporting in good 

faith of suspected reportable conduct 

by establishing clearly defined and 

centralised processes through which  

such reports may be made with 

confidence that employees and other 

persons making such reports will be 

treated fairly and, to the extent possible, 

protected from reprisal.

Sustaining Growth


Risk Management

GRI 102-11 / 102-15 / 103-1 / 103-2 / 103-3

We maintain a balanced approach to risk management, undertaking 

only appropriate and well-considered risks to optimise returns for 

our shareholders.

Keppel's risk management approach arises 

from the philosophy of seeking sustainable 

growth opportunities and creating economic 

value, while ensuring only appropriate and 

well-considered risks are assumed. Risk 

management is an integral part of the way  

in which we develop and execute our 

business strategies. 

Notwithstanding the challenges, we continued 

a disciplined pursuit of new opportunities, 

innovation and revenue streams to 

safeguard shareholders’ interest and the 

Group’s assets. Our robust risk-centric 

culture and risk management system 

have enabled us to continue to respond 

effectively to the dynamic business 

environment, shifting business demands 

and to seize new value-added opportunities 

for our stakeholders. 

Risk-Centric Culture

Effective risk management hinges not only 

on systems and processes, but equally on 

mindsets and attitudes. The Group fosters a 

risk-centric culture through several aspects.

1. Leadership &amp; Governance

 

Our management is fully committed to 

fostering a strong risk-centric culture, 

role-modelling and demonstrating strong 

support for risk management in all 

initiatives. Key messages encouraging 

prudent risk taking in decision-making 

and business processes are interwoven 

into major meetings, speeches and 

publications.

2. Framework &amp; Values

 

Supported by an established risk 

management framework, our core values 

of integrity, accountability, people-

centredness and safety, along with our 

refreshed mission to deliver solutions 

for sustainable urbanisation responsibly, 

guides management and staff to 

consider risks in all their daily activities.

3. Process &amp; Methods

 

In applying the risk management 

framework and guided by best practices, 

an integral aspect of both strategic and 

operational decision making includes 

consideration and management of 

risks at all levels of the businesses.  

As part of the process, appropriate 

tools, techniques and risk 

management methodologies are 

applied along with the requisite 

domain knowledge capabilities.

4. Training &amp; Communication

 

Training and communication are 

held regularly to enhance risk 

management competency across 

the Group.Through various forums 

and in-house publications, including 

different modes of training, risk 

management is reinforced as a 

discipline and developed through 

awareness and practice.

5. Transparency &amp; Competency

 

We promote transparency in 

information sharing and escalation of 

risk-related matters. Risk identification 

and assessment are embedded in 

our control processes. A Group-wide 

survey is conducted periodically to 

assess the level of risk awareness 

amongst employees. 

6. Ownership &amp; Accountability

 

To maintain our standards in risk  

management, we advocate ownership 

and accountability of our employees 

for risk management through the 

performance evaluation process. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

Framework

Keppel’s Board is responsible for 

risk governance and ensures that 

management maintains a sound system 

of risk management and internal controls. 

Through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), 

the Board provides valuable advice to 

management in formulating the risk 

management framework, policies and 

guidelines. Our management surfaces 

significant risk issues for discussion with 

the BRC and the Board to keep them  

fully informed in a timely manner.

The terms of reference for the BRC  

are disclosed on pages 79 and 80 of  

Keppel Corporation's Report to 

Shareholders 2017.

The Board has defined three risk  

tolerance guiding principles for the Group. 

These principles serve to determine 

the nature and extent of the significant 

risks which our Board is willing to take in 

achieving our strategic objectives.

Keppel Corporation Limited |  Sustainability Report 2017


Risk Management

These principles are:

1. 

Risk taken should be carefully evaluated, 

commensurate with rewards and in line 

with the Group’s core strengths and 

strategic objectives.

2. No risk arising from a single area of 

operation, investment or undertaking 

should be so huge as to endanger the 

entire Group.

3. The Group does not condone safety 

breaches or lapses, non-compliance 

with laws and regulations, as well as acts 

such as fraud, bribery and corruption.

Keppel’s risk governance framework, set out 

on pages 74 to 77 in Keppel Corporation's 

Report to Shareholders 2017, under Principle 

11 (Risk Management and Internal Controls), 

facilitates management and the BRC in 

determining the adequacy and effectiveness 

of the Group’s risk management system. 

Risk management is an integral part of 

decision-making across the Group. We are 

cognisant of the dynamic environment in 

which the Group operates and continue 

to constantly refine the framework and 

systems where necessary, to ensure strong 

risk governance across the Group. Keppel’s 

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 

framework, a component of Keppel’s System  

of Management Controls, provides the 

Group with a holistic and systematic 

approach to risk management. It outlines 

the reporting structure, monitoring 

mechanisms, processes and tools, as well  

as policies and limits, in addressing the 

Group’s key risks.

Our ERM framework is constantly refined 

to ensure relevance in a dynamic operating 

environment and where required, tailored 

to the requirements of each business unit 

depending on specific industries and 

objectives. The framework takes reference 

from the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance, ISO 31000, ISO 22313 and the 

Guidebook for Audit Committees.

Our Risk and Compliance Committee, 

comprising relevant subject matter risk 

champions across the business units, drives  

and coordinates Group-wide risk management 

activities and initiatives. This is bolstered 

by regular bilateral and business unit level 

meetings to ensure that relevant risks are 

identified, assessed and mitigated in a 

timely manner. We keep abreast of the 

latest developments and best practices 

through participation in industry seminars 

and interacting with risk management 

practitioners.

We adopt a balanced approach to risk 

management. Given not all risks can be 

eliminated, we are committed to undertaking 

appropriate and well-considered risks to 

optimise returns for the Group.

Strategic Risks

Market &amp; Competition 

A large part of the Group’s strategic risks 

comprise market driven forces, evolving 

competitive landscapes, changing customer  

demands and disruptive innovation. The 

Group remains vulnerable to a number of 

external factors including uncertainties 

in the global economy, implications from 

geo-political developments and threats of 

disruptive technology. These risks receive 

constant high-level attention throughout 

the year. Strategy meetings are held across 

the Group to review business strategies, 

formulate responses and take pre-emptive 

action against these risks.

The BRC guides the Group in formulating 

and reviewing risk policies and limits. These 

policies and limits are subject to periodic 

reviews to ensure they continue to support 

business objectives and are aligned to our 

risk tolerance level. Taking into consideration 

the prevailing business climate and the 

Group’s risk appetite, the policies aim to 

address risks effectively and proactively.

Investments &amp; Divestments

We have an established process for 

evaluating investment and divestment 

decisions. Investments are monitored to 

ensure they are on track to meet the Group’s 

strategic intent, investment objectives and 

returns. These investment decisions are 

guided by investment parameters set on  

a Group-wide basis.

Together with the Board, the Investment 

and Major Project Action Committee (IMPAC) 

guides the Group to take considered risks in 

a controlled manner, exercising the spirit of 

enterprise, as well as prudence to earn the 

best risk-adjusted returns on invested capital 

across all our businesses. 

Investment risk assessment involves  

rigorous due diligence, feasibility studies 

and sensitivity analyses of key assumptions 

and variables. Some factors considered in 

the assessment include alignment to Group 

strategy, financial viability, country-specific 

political and regulatory developments, 

contractual risk implications as well as 

lessons learnt. The investment portfolio 

is constantly monitored to ensure that 

performance is on track to meet the Group’s 

strategic intent and investment returns.

Human Resources

We continue to maintain a strong emphasis 

on attracting and building a deep pool of 

talent. This includes nurturing employees, 

maintaining good industrial relations and 

fostering a conducive work environment 

for our employees. The Group is focused 

on strengthening succession planning 

and bench strength, as well as building 

organisational capabilities to drive business 

growth whilst maintaining our status as an 

employer of choice.

We recognise the importance of having 

a risk-centric mindset and the ability to 

identify, assess, develop and implement 

mitigation actions, as well as monitor risks. 

Keppel Leadership Institute, established 

as a global centre to groom leaders and 

equip them with the capabilities to drive 

and support Keppel’s growth, helps to 

inculcate this mindset by embedding risk 

management in its key leadership courses.

Operational Risks

Project Management

From initiation through to completion,  

risk management processes are an integral 

part of project management activities to 

facilitate early risk detection and proactive 

management. The Group adopts a 

systematic assessment and monitoring 

process to help manage the key risks for 

each project. Particular attention is given 

to technically challenging and high-value 

projects, including greenfield developments, 

as well as those that involve new technology 

or operations in a new country. Projects  

are managed in accordance to the  

respective country’s environmental laws  

and labour practices.

At the project execution stage, we carry 

out project reviews and quality assurance 

programmes to address issues involving 

cost, schedule and quality. Project Key Risk 

Indicators are used as early warning signals. 

In addition, we conduct knowledge sharing 

workshops to share best practices and 

lessons learnt across the Group. All these 

help to ensure that projects are completed 

on time and within budget, while meeting 

safety and quality standards, as well as 

contract obligations.

Health, Safety &amp; Environment 

Maintaining a high level of Health, Safety 

and Environmental (HSE) standard is of 

paramount importance to the Group.

We constantly strive to raise awareness, 

maintain vigilance and foster a strong  

HSE-centric culture across the Group and  

particularly at the ground level. Key initiatives 

include driving a Zero Fatality Strategy  

with a roadmap focused on aligning High 

Impact Risk Activities safety standards 

across our global operations, enhancing 

competency of employees performing 

safety-critical tasks, strengthening 

operational controls, deploying standard 

Root Cause Analysis across the Group, as well 

as developing more proactive and leading 

matrices to monitor HSE performance. 

Environmental management practices in key 

operating sites are also closely monitored. 

As a Group, we continue to embrace 

and leverage technology to improve HSE 

36

Sustaining Growth


processes and systems. Testament to the 

Group’s concerted efforts in safety, Keppel  

clinched 36 awards at the WSH Awards  

for exemplary safety performances and  

implementation of strong WSH management 

systems, as well as efforts in creating 

solutions that improve workplace safety.

Business &amp; Operational Processes 

We continue to streamline business 

processes. We have implemented initiatives 

to establish a common shared services 

platform which allows us to continue to 

achieve cost savings, improve efficiency  

and productivity, as well as enhance 

governance, compliance and control.

We have adopted ISO standards and 

certifications to achieve standardisation of 

processes and best practices. In addition, 

procedures relating to defect management, 

operations, project control and supply chain 

management were established to improve 

the quality of deliverables. We conduct 

regular reviews of policies and authority 

limits to ensure that they remain relevant in 

meeting changing business requirements.

Business Continuity

We are committed to enhancing operational 

resilience through a robust Business 

Continuity Management (BCM) Plan that  

will equip us to respond effectively to 

business disruptions, ensuring that critical 

business functions continue to operate with 

minimal impact to our people, operations 

and assets. As a Group, we are cognisant 

of the increasing risk of natural disasters, 

terrorism and cyber threats, and have 

increased our efforts in reviewing and 

testing our operational preparedness and 

effectiveness of our BCM plans. Follow-up 

actions are taken to strengthen operational 

resilience with all key learning points 

documented.

Crisis management and communication 

procedures have also been embedded  

into the Group’s BCM processes. These 

procedures are constantly refined to allow 

us to respond in an orderly and coordinated 

way, as well as to expedite recovery.

Urbanisation and connectivity have given  

rise to rapidly increasing concerns around 

cyber security. The Group maintains a close 

watch and keeps abreast of techniques and 

threats as they evolve, in order to develop  

the appropriate mitigation measures. 

This will remain a key focus area for the 

Group. Our focus is on building capabilities 

to respond to crises effectively while 

safeguarding our people, assets and the 

interests of our stakeholders.

Information Technology

The Group has in place an Information 

Technology (IT) security framework to 

address evolving IT security threats such as 

hacking, malware, mobile threats and loss 

of data.

Our IT security, governance and control  

have been strengthened through the 

alignment of IT policies, processes and 

systems, and the consolidation of servers 

and storages. We have also appointed  

IT security officers and implemented  

guided self-assessments to identify IT 

security gaps.

We have dedicated IT expertise to keep 

abreast of the latest developments, 

innovation and threats in technology  

and assess their impact and risks at 

various levels. Extensive training, including 

assessment exercises, have been conducted 

on user security education to heighten 

awareness of IT threats. Measures and 

considerations have also been taken to 

safeguard against loss of information,  

data security and prolonged service 

disruption of critical IT systems.

Compliance Risks

GRI 205-1

Laws, Regulations &amp; Compliance 

Given the geographical diversity of 

our businesses, we closely monitor 

developments in the laws and regulations  

of countries where the Group operates  

to ensure that our businesses and  

operations comply with all relevant laws  

and regulations. We regularly engage  

with local government authorities and 

agencies to keep abreast of changes  

to laws and regulations.

We recognise that non-compliance  

with laws and regulations not only has 

significant financial impact but potentially 

detrimental reputational impact on 

the Group. We are fully committed to 

strengthening our regulatory compliance 

framework. Our emphasis is clear and 

consistently reiterated. We have zero 

tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption and 

violation of laws and regulations. 

During the year, we continued to make 

significant progress on our regulatory 

compliance initiatives, ensuring that 

compliance principles are embedded  

in our activities and implementing best 

practices from industry leaders as we 

develop and strengthen our compliance 

framework. Significant risks issues, such 

as risks relating to corruption in all areas of 

operations within the Keppel Group, are 

surfaced by management and assessed 

by the Board. With respect to corruption, 

significant risks include areas where external 

agents are used for business development. 

More details on the steps taken by the Group 

in operationalising regulatory compliance 

are set out on pages 38 and 39 of this report. 

Financial Risks

Fraud, Misstatement of Financial 

Statements &amp; Disclosures

We maintain a strong emphasis on 

ensuring financial statements are accurate 

and presented fairly in accordance with 

applicable financial reporting standards  

and framework.

Regular external and internal audits are 

conducted to provide assurance on accuracy 

of financial statements and adequacy of the 

internal control framework supporting the 

statements. Where required, we leverage 

the expertise of the engaged auditors in 

the interpretation of financial reporting 

standards and changes. We hold regular 

training and education programmes to 

enhance competency of finance managers 

across the Group. Keppel’s System of 

Management Controls framework outlines 

the Group’s internal control and risk 

management processes and procedures.  

For more details on the framework, please 

refer to page 34 of this report.

Financial Management

Financial risk management relates to our 

ability to meet financial obligations and 

mitigate credit, liquidity, currency and 

interest rate risks. Policies and financial 

authority limits are reviewed regularly to 

incorporate changes in the operating and 

control environment.

At Keppel, we are focused on financial 

discipline, deploying our capital to earn the 

best risk-adjusted returns and maintaining 

a strong balance sheet to seize new 

opportunities. This includes the evaluation 

of counterparties and related risks against 

pre-established guidelines. For more details 

on the Group’s financial risk management, 

please refer to pages 57 and 58 of Keppel 

Corporation's Report to Shareholders 2017. 

Impact assessment and stress tests are  

performed to gauge the Group’s exposure 

to changing market situations, allowing 

for informed decision-making and 

implementation of prompt mitigating 

actions. We regularly monitor the 

concentration of exposure in the countries 

where the Group operates to ensure that 

our portfolio of assets, investments and 

businesses are adequately safeguarded 

against the systemic risks of operating in  

a specific geography.

Proactive Risk Management

We remain vigilant against emerging 

threats that may affect our different 

businesses. Through close collaboration with 

stakeholders and keeping vigilant, we will 

continue to assess our risks and review our 

risk management system to ensure that our 

ability to manage and respond to threats 

remains adequate and effective.

37

Keppel Corporation Limited |  Sustainability Report 2017


Regulatory Compliance

GRI 102-15

The tone for regulatory compliance is driven from the top.  

Guided by our core values, we are committed to building a more 

disciplined and sustainable company.

Guided by our core values and enhanced 

code of conduct, we are fully committed 

to ensuring that compliance is a central 

pillar of our management and an integral 

part of our corporate culture and business 

processes. We will do business the right way 

and comply with all applicable laws and 

regulations wherever we operate. We strive 

to achieve outstanding performance, whilst 

maintaining the highest level of ethical 

integrity. Our tone on regulatory compliance 

is clear and consistently reiterated from 

the top of the organisation. We have zero 

tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption and 

violation of laws and regulations. 

Strategic Objectives

Following the improvements and 

enhancements to the compliance framework 

and processes implemented since 2015, 

we are focused on ensuring consistency 

in application and effectiveness of the 

compliance programme across the Group. 

We want a compliance framework that 

commensurates with the size, role and 

activity of our businesses, including the 

appropriate compliance control systems, 

to be able to effectively detect and remedy 

gaps. Most importantly, we are focused  

on rebuilding our credibility and reputation 

with our stakeholders and to build a 

sustainable compliance framework to 

support the Group's growth.

Governance Structure

Our Regulatory Compliance Governance 

Structure is designed to strengthen our 

corporate governance. The Board Risk 

Committee (BRC) supports the Board in  

its oversight of regulatory compliance and 

is responsible for driving the Group’s focus 

on implementing effective compliance 

and governance systems. The Group 

Risk &amp; Compliance Department serves as 

a secretariat to the BRC, assessing and 

reporting on the Group’s compliance risks, 

controls and mitigations.

The Group Regulatory Compliance 

Management Committee (“Group RCMC”) 

is chaired by Keppel Corporation’s Chief 

Executive Officer (CEO) and its members 

includes all business unit heads. The role  

of the Group RCMC is to articulate the 

Group’s commitment to regulatory 

compliance, direct and support the 

development of overarching compliance 

policies and guidelines, and facilitate the 

effective implementation of policies and 

procedures across the Group. 

The Group RCMC is supported by the  

Group Regulatory Compliance Working 

Team (“Group RCWT”), which is chaired by 

the Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance.  

The Group RCWT oversees the development 

and review of pertinent regulatory compliance 

matters, overarching compliance policies 

and guidelines for the Group, as well as 

reviewing training and communication 

programmes.

Each business unit in the Group has a 

dedicated Compliance Lead, supported 

by the respective risk and compliance 

teams, and is responsible for driving and 

administering the compliance function 

and agenda for the business unit. This 

includes providing support to business unit 

management with subject matter expertise, 

process excellence and regular reporting to 

ensure that compliance risks are effectively 

managed and mitigated. Across the 

Group, recruitment efforts are in progress 

to strengthen the Compliance team with 

additional professional and experienced 

compliance officers.

Under the overall direction of the Group 

RCMC and Group RCWT, business units 

working in partnership with their  

respective risk and compliance teams  

are responsible for implementing the 

Group’s Code of Conduct and regulatory 

compliance policies and procedures.  

They are also responsible for ensuring  

that risk assessments in relation to  

material regulatory compliance risks  

are conducted, and control measures  

are adequate and effective, to mitigate  

the identified risks which the business  

units may face. 

Regulatory Compliance Framework

As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen  

our regulatory compliance framework,  

we have further defined our focus  

on compliance covering broadly the 

following areas: culture, policies and 

procedures, training and communication, 

key compliance processes, compliance  

risk assessment, reviews and monitoring, 

and compliance resources. 

One of the more important aspects of  

the framework is the structure of the 

compliance organisation. During the year, 

we made changes to the reporting  

structure of the compliance organisation  

to reinforce independence of the function. 

The Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance  

now reports directly to the Chairman  

of the BRC. Similarly, the compliance leads  

of the business units have established  

direct reporting lines to the respective  

Audit or Board Risk Committees. In  

addition, business unit compliance  

leads report directly to the Head of  

Group Risk &amp; Compliance. This reporting 

structure reinforces independence of  

the function and enables senior 

management, including members of  

the Board, to provide continuous, clear  

and explicit support to the Group’s 

compliance programme.

Culture

Culture and mindset are critical in ensuring 

effectiveness of the compliance programme. 

Management has a key role in setting the 

right tone and walking the talk. The tone  

on full regulatory compliance has to cascade 

through the organisation. During the year, 

we implemented initiatives to continue  

to foster the desired full compliance culture. 

These include campaign posters on  

anti-bribery, anti-corruption and reporting 

mechanisms that are now exhibited in  

all our offices globally to reinforce the 

message; individual performance measures 

to influence personal behaviour, and 

periodic compliance-focused messages 

delivered by business unit heads to 

their employees. A Group-wide survey 

was conducted to assess awareness of 

compliance and to identify potential areas 

requiring further emphasis.

Policies &amp; Procedures

GRI 102-16 / 102-17

Employee Code of Conduct 

We have a strict Code of Conduct that 

applies to all employees, who are required 

to acknowledge and comply with the Code. 

The Code of Conduct sets out important 

principles to guide employees in carrying 

out their duties and responsibilities to  

the highest standards of personal and 

corporate integrity. It covers areas from 

conduct in the workplace to business 

conduct, including clear provisions on 

prohibitions against bribery and corruption, 

and conflicts of interests amongst others. 

Appropriate disciplinary action, including 

suspension or termination of employment, 

will be taken in the event that an employee  

is found to have violated the rules set 

out in the Code of Conduct. The Code of 

Conduct is also provided to all third parties 

who represent Keppel in business dealings, 

including joint venture partners, who are 

required to acknowledge understanding  

and compliance with the requirements of  

the Code of Conduct.

Supplier Code of Conduct

The acknowledgement to abide by 

our Supplier Code of Conduct, which 

was developed to integrate Keppel’s 

sustainability principles across our 

supply chain, and positively influence the 

environmental, social and governance 

performance of our suppliers, is mandatory 

for all key suppliers of the Keppel Group.  

The areas covered within the Keppel Supplier 

Code of Conduct include proper business 

conduct, fair labour practices, stringent 

safety and health standards, and responsible 

environmental management.

Whistle-Blower Policy

Keppel’s Whistle-Blower Policy encourages 

the reporting of suspected bribery,  

violations or misconduct through a  

clearly-defined process and reporting 

channel, by which reports can be  

made in confidence and without fear of 

reprisal. The process is reviewed regularly.  

During the year, we made enhancements  

to ensure that reporting channels are  

readily available and we are in the process  

of implementing solutions to cater to 

different languages and time zone 

requirements globally.

Compliance Policies

The Group maintains a comprehensive list 

of policies covering compliance-related 

matters including gifts, hospitality, agent 

fees, donations, sponsorships and insider 

trading amongst others. These policies are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that they 

commensurate with the activities in the 

jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 

Group policies are applicable to all business 

units and unless the jurisdictional regulatory 

requirements are more stringent, the  

Group policy represents the minimum 

standard for the Group.

Training &amp; Communications

GRI 205-2

Training is an essential component of 

Keppel’s regulatory compliance framework. 

Our programmes are tailored to specific 

audiences and we leverage Group-wide 

forums to reiterate key messages.  

We have a comprehensive annual  

e-learning training programme which  

is mandatory for all directors, officers  

and employees. The content of the  

training covers key compliance policies,  

and directors, officers and employees  

are required to complete assessments  

at the end of the training to successfully  

mark completion. As part of the annual 

training, directors, officers and employees 

are also required to formally acknowledge 

their understanding of policies and  

declare any potential conflicts of interest.

We continue to focus on refining our 

compliance training programmes  

and curriculum for new and existing 

employees as well as, to develop and  

tailor training content depending on  

the target audience. In addition to  

policy-related training programmes,  

we conduct trainings focused on the  

line manager's responsibilities in developing 

the desired culture and mindset regarding 

compliance. These responsibilities include 

the need to establish and maintain  

effective internal controls to ensure  

that processes are robust and potential  

gaps are identified and mitigated in a  

timely manner. 

Group Risk &amp; Compliance conducts 

periodic site visits, particularly to locations 

susceptible to higher corruption risks,  

to raise awareness of compliance risks.  

In addition, we leverage opportunities  

at various management conferences  

and employee meetings to stress the 

importance of compliance.

Key Processes

Due Diligence 

We have improved our risk-based due 

diligence process for all third party 

associates who represent the Keppel Group 

in business dealings, including our joint 

venture partners, to assess the compliance 

risk of the business partner. In addition 

to background checks, the due diligence 

process incorporates requirements for 

third party associates to acknowledge 

understanding and compliance with  

our Code of Conduct. 

Other Processes

As part of our ongoing review of policies  

and procedures, we ensure compliance 

oversight is embedded in key processes 

including areas such as gifts and hospitality, 

agent fees, donations and sponsorships,  

as well as conflicts of interest. 

Best Practices 

We recognise the need to continually 

benchmark our compliance programmes 

against best practices and augment our 

processes to ensure they are consistent  

and robust. During the year, our compliance 

framework and programmes have also  

been reviewed by an external advisor  

and all recommendations from the  

review have been incorporated into  

our compliance initiatives.

Risk Assessment, Review &amp;  

Monitoring 

GRI 102-30

We continue to develop our compliance 

resources and framework. This will  

enable the Compliance team to  

conduct independent risk assessments  

to identify and mitigate key compliance  

risks. Regular discussions are held with  

all business units, focusing on risk 

assessments including specific compliance 

risks identified for their respective 

businesses. Separately, independent  

reviews of compliance risks are carried  

out within the scope of internal audits 

including thematic reviews of the 

effectiveness of key aspects of our 

compliance programmes. 

Resources

We recognise the need for an experienced  

compliance team to effectively support  

the business in compliance advisory,  

as well as to ensure that compliance 

programmes and controls are effectively 

implemented. Senior management, 

including members of the Board, are fully 

committed to ensuring that we build a 

strong compliance function.

Management Approach 

GRI 103-1 / 103-2 / 103-3

The Group’s risk-based strategies are  

used to assess, avoid, reduce and mitigate 

environmental risks and impacts. Our focus 

areas are enhancing energy efficiency, 

managing water and waste, reducing 

our carbon emissions and improving our 

environmental management systems.  

The implementation of our Group-wide 

carbon management strategy is led by 

the Energy Efficiency Committee, which is 

chaired by Cindy Lim, Keppel Corporation’s 

Director of Group Corporate Development, 

and Managing Director of Keppel Urban 

Solutions. The committee sets targets, 

evaluates the effectiveness of our carbon 

management efforts, and monitors and 

reports on performance. The Committee 

comprises representatives from business 

units, many of whom are certified  

energy managers.  

Most of our key business units are 

certified to the ISO 14001 Environmental 

Management System, which guides  

how we identify, manage, monitor and 

control environmental issues. Other 

certifications include the SS 564 Singapore 

Standard for National Green Data Centres 

Management System.

 

Overview

The proactive management of our 

environmental impact enables us to  

improve resource efficiency, reduce  

costs and support the global climate  

change agenda.

This environmental performance report 

includes data from the Group’s major 

subsidiaries in Singapore and overseas 

operations in which the Group has significant 

ownership. This includes Keppel Offshore 

&amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) and its significant 

subsidiaries – Keppel FELS, Keppel Shipyard 

and Keppel Singmarine, Keppel Land,  

Keppel Infrastructure, Keppel 

Telecommunications &amp; Transportation 

(Keppel T&amp;T) and Keppel Capital. 

We have been progressively expanding the 

scope of our reporting to cover all major 

entities in the Group. The scope of our 

reporting in 2017 was expanded to include 

data from two of Keppel Infrastructure 

Trust’s assets – the Basslink Interconnector  

in Australia and SingSpring Desalination 

Plant in Singapore.

Due to commercial sensitivity, direct energy  

consumption and carbon emissions arising  

from Keppel Infrastructure’s power generation 

operations are excluded from this report. 

We are committed to improve resource efficiency and reduce our 

environmental impact.

Energy

GRI 302-1 / 302-4

The Group’s energy demand comprises a  

mix of direct and indirect sources of energy. 

Direct energy refers to primary sources of 

energy consumed on site by our operations, 

whereas indirect energy is electricity 

purchased from external suppliers. 

The Group’s primary energy sources are 

diesel, naptha, Piped Natural Gas, petrol, 

furnace oil and Liquefied Petroleum Gas.

In 2017, the Group consumed 7,271,829 

gigajoules (GJ) of direct energy and 1,890,734 GJ 

of indirect energy or electricity, compared to 

7,394,690 GJ of direct energy and 1,820,611 GJ 

of indirect energy in 2016. 

Our Singapore operations consumed 7,149,190 GJ  

of direct energy and 1,643,681 GJ of indirect 

energy in 2017, compared to 7,166,393 GJ of 

direct energy and 1,595,838 GJ of indirect 

energy in 2016. The data includes direct 

energy used in activities carried out by both 

employees and contractors at our worksites.

The slight decrease in direct energy consumption 

was due mainly to the combination of 

reduced yard activities and green initiatives 

such as the replacement of diesel generators 

at our shipyards with electricity or renewable 

energy. The significant increase in direct 

energy in 2016 compared to 2015 was due  

to the inclusion of direct energy consumption 

from City Gas, the sole retailer of town gas  

in Singapore. 

The increase in indirect energy consumption 

was mainly due to the inclusion of indirect 

energy consumption from SingSpring 

Desalination Plant and the Basslink 

Interconnector. Excluding these two facilities,  

the Group had consumed 1,523,109 GJ 

of indirect energy in 2017. This is a 4.8% 

reduction from 1,595,838 GJ in 2016, which 

is attributed to various energy efficiency 

initiatives across the Group.

Improving Energy Efficiency

The Group is estimated to have saved 

650,144 GJ2 of energy from its energy 

efficiency initiatives in 2017 and from  

Keppel Land’s Green Mark-certified 

developments3. The total energy saving is 

equivalent to nearly 7.1% of the Group’s total 

energy consumption in 2017, and translates to 

estimated cost savings of about $37 million4 

and avoidance of approximately 77,000 

tonnes of carbon dioxide (t-CO2) emissions5. 

These savings were achieved through the 

optimisation of operations and processes; 

technological improvements, including 

the adoption of more sustainable building 

designs and materials; and the use of 

energy-efficient equipment and devices. 

Examples of initiatives in 2017 are: 

• Florescent lights at Keppel FELS’ 

Production Office were replaced with 

more energy-efficient LED lights6. 

• Halogen, incandescent and general lights 

on board Keppel Shipyard’s vessels were 

replaced with LED lights, some of which 

are battery-powered. 

• A chilled water cooling system, diesel 

rotary uninterruptible power supply 

system with a distributed redundant 

configuration, and a combination of 

multi-compressor and centrifugal chillers 

were installed to optimise efficiency at 

different load conditions at KDC SGP 47.

Harnessing Renewables

Keppel DC Dublin 1 data centre in Ireland is 

now fully powered by renewable energy. 

This initiative by KDCR (Ireland), a wholly-

owned entity of Keppel DC REIT, helps avoid 

the emission of more than 11,000 t-CO2 

per year8. 

Keppel O&amp;M and Keppel Infrastructure  

are collaborating on a solar leasing 

project at Keppel O&amp;M’s yards, where the 

renewable energy generated will help 

offset the yards’ energy requirements.  

In addition, some of the renewable  

energy certificates generated through  

this initiative will be transferred to  

Keppel Corporation, allowing our corporate 

office to be fully powered by clean  

energy from the end of 2018 through  

the retirement of these certificates9. 

Separately, Keppel O&amp;M entered into a 

Memorandum of Understanding with 

Nanyang Technological University to  

explore collaboration in renewable  

energy and micro-grid projects.

Water

GRI 303-1 / 303-3

Water is a precious resource. The Group 

continues to strengthen its water 

conservation efforts through initiatives  

like promoting water-saving practices, 

adopting water-efficient technologies  

and equipment as well as implementing 

process improvements.

The total water consumption of the Group 

consists of potable water (water from  

local catchment and imported water), 

NEWater (treated wastewater from 

sewage), recycled water and water drawn 

from rivers. 

The Group consumed 5,111,239 cubic 

metres (m3) of water in 2017. This is a 7%  

decrease compared to 5,499,136 m3 in 2016. 

For yards that were closed or divested in 

2017, data from the beginning of the year 

to the time of closure is included.

consumed in Singapore, close to 17%, or 

727,646 m3, was recycled water used in 

Keppel Infrastructure’s waste-to-energy 

(WTE) plants. The decrease in water 

consumption at the Group level is largely 

attributed to a reduction in yard activities  

in Brazil, the Philippines and the US,  

as well as the sale of Keppel Verolme.

Water Recycling

The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City Water 

Reclamation Centre was officially opened 

in June 2017. The Centre, a joint venture 

between Keppel Infrastructure and  

Tianjin Eco-City Investment and 

Development Co., Ltd., treats wastewater 

effluent from an existing wastewater 

treatment plant to produce recycled  

water that meets China's most stringent 

standards for urban miscellaneous  

water consumption.

At Keppel DC REIT’s data centres, most of  

the water consumed is used by chilled 

water cooling systems to maintain optimal 

environmental conditions for clients’ 

mission-critical IT equipment. To reduce 

water consumption, the REIT worked to 

increase the water recycling capability of  

the cooling towers at Keppel DC Singapore 1 

and Keppel DC Singapore 2.

2 The 650,144 GJ in savings comprise savings from the reduced usage of fossil fuels, such as 

diesel, and a reduction in electricity consumed. The amount of savings in absolute terms is the 

difference in consumption before and after the implementation of an energy efficiency project. 

The savings are converted to energy equivalent in gigajoules based on the corresponding 

energy conversion factors for fossil fuels and electricity published in the United Kingdom’s 

Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2015 Government GHG Conversion 

Factors for Company Reporting, whereby 1 kWh = 0.0036 GJ and 1 tonne of diesel = 43.33 GJ.

3  The environmental performance of Green Mark-certified developments were assessed based on 

Singapore’s BCA Green Mark for Non-Residential/Residential Buildings Criteria, Technical Guide 

and Requirements. These include completed developments as well as Green Mark projects 

awarded in 2017.

4   The electricity conversion factor used is based on the United Kingdom's DEFRA 2015 

Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, whereby 1 kWh = 0.0036 GJ. 

Estimated monetary savings are calculated based on the average electricity tariff rates in 2017 as 

published by Singapore Power, whereby 1 kWh = $0.2065.

5 The electricity savings in carbon dioxide equivalent was estimated by multiplying the energy 

savings in kWh with the Electricity Grid Emission Factor (1 kWh = 0.4244 kg CO2) published by 

Singapore’s Energy Market Authority.

6 The amount of savings in absolute terms is the difference in consumption before and after the 

replacement of conventional lighting to LED lights. Savings are calculated based on savings of  

64 W each for 80 LED lights, and savings of 30 W each for 80 LED lights, running for 8 hours a 

day, for 300 days annually. 

7  The amount of savings in absolute terms is the difference in consumption before and after the 

implementation of energy efficiency features at the data centre, using code compliant data 

centres as the reference baseline.

8 Energy savings was based on estimated annual electrical consumption at Keppel DC Dublin 1. 

Carbon dioxide savings quoted based on the latest published All Island Average CO2 Emissions 

of 0.393 t/MWh for 2015, Commission for Energy Regulation, July 2016. 

9 When completed, the project is expected to have an installed solar capacity of 10 MW, which will 

generate energy savings of 11 million kWh of energy per year.

that was landfilled in 2016. The decrease is 

attributed to a decrease in activities at our 

yards, as well as Keppel FELS’ new initiative 

of collecting wood waste for recycling.

Emissions &amp; Effluents

GRI 305-1 / 305-2 / 305-5 / 305-7

Emissions Intensity Targets

Keppel aims to achieve a 16% improvement 

in carbon emissions from 2020 business-as-

usual levels. This is based on the national 

targets which the Singapore Government 

had disclosed in 2009. Keppel’s Energy 

Efficiency Committee has evaluated the 

Group’s progress towards this goal based 

on carbon emissions intensity, and affirmed 

that we are on track to achieve this target. 

In support of the Paris Agreement,  

Singapore announced its Intended Nationally 

Determined Contribution of reducing 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity 

by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030. In line with 

the government’s commitment, we have set 

a new long-term target of a 28.8% reduction 

in carbon emissions intensity from 2010 

levels by 2030 for our global operations11.  

Our target was derived by adjusting the 

national target to a shorter timeframe,  

as data prior to 2010 is unavailable.

As at end 2017, our operations in Singapore, 

which account for 80% of the Group’s total 

emissions, have achieved a 27.7% cumulative 

averaged reduction in emissions intensity 

from our 2010 baseline12. We are working to 

progressively include overseas facilities in 

our monitoring.

During the dry season, treated effluent  

water from the refuse leachate and waste 

water at Keppel Infrastructure’s Senoko 

WTE Plant is further treated to be used 

for ash quenching and fire prevention by 

wetting dry refuse in the bunker, reducing 

the demand for NEWater.

The Group recycled a total of 727,702 m3 

of water in 2017, which is equivalent to 

approximately 14% of the Group’s total  

water consumption10. This is a 150% 

increase from the 294,361 m3 of water 

recycled in 2016, and over ten times  

the 66,278 m3 of water recycled in 2015. 

The increase was largely attributed to  

the optimisation of the effluent  

filtration system at Senoko WTE Plant,  

an increase in rainwater harvested and  

the redirection of water drained during 

boiler shutdowns into the recycled  

water system. 

Waste

GRI 306-2

The Group strives to minimise waste 

generation, increase opportunities for 

reusing and recycling, as well as treat and 

dispose waste responsibly where other 

options are not practicable. 

Waste is segregated at our offices,  

plants and yards to promote reuse and 

recycling. In 2017, Keppel FELS started 

collecting wood waste for recycling  

instead of sending it to landfills or for 

incineration. Used papers from our 

offices as well as scrap metals and spoilt 

equipment recovered from our shipyards 

and WTE plants are sent for recycling. 

Hazardous waste generated is handled, 

stored and disposed in a manner that 

adheres to best practices and meets local 

regulatory requirements. 

In 2017, the Group recycled 44,127 tonnes (t)  

of refuse, which is an 85% decrease from 

297,137 t of waste in 2016. This decrease 

is largely attributed to a reduction in yard 

activities and the closure and divestment  

of several yards during the year. Waste 

recycled included ferrous scrap, grits, 

plastic stretch wrap, paper and other office 

consumables. Our Singapore operations 

recycled 38,195 t of waste in 2017, a 19% 

decrease from 47,263 t of waste recycled  

in Singapore the previous year. 

As a Group, a total of 27,743 t of waste  

was sent for incineration in 2017, a slight 

decrease compared to 27,948 t in 2016. 

In land-scarce Singapore, refuse is 

incinerated to reduce the volume of waste 

and to remove harmful substances before 

disposal at the landﬁll. A total of 24,067 t 

of waste was sent for incineration in 2017, 

registering a 13.8% decrease compared to 

27,929 t in 2016. 

As incineration of refuse is prohibited or 

unavailable in some countries where we 

operate, a total of 1,539 t of municipal 

waste was disposed at landﬁll sites in 2017, 

a significant drop from 3,815 t of waste

10  Includes data from the Group’s major subsidiaries in Singapore and 

overseas operations in which the Group has significant ownership, 

excluding Keppel DC REIT’s data centres.

11 For calculation of emissions intensity reductions, each business 

division first computes its base year (i.e. 2010) emissions intensity 

using a normalising factor relevant to its business activity. Thereafter, 

emissions intensity is compared on a year-on-year basis to derive 

a percentage reduction in terms of intensity against the previous 

year. The Group’s emissions intensity reduction is an average of the 

reductions achieved by business divisions in a year. The total emissions 

intensity reduction is the cumulative sum of the year-on-year emissions 

intensity reductions that the Group has achieved from our base year to 

the current year in which the data is reported. The normalisation factors 

for our business divisions are based on its key activities and industry 

best practices. They are as follows: million man-hours for Keppel FELS, 

Keppel Shipyard, Keppel Singmarine and Keppel Logistics; gross floor 

area for Keppel Land and Keppel DC REIT; revenue for Keppel Data 

Centres; million kilowatt hours for City Gas; volume of water produced 

for SingSpring Desalination Plant, volume of NEWater produced for  

the Ulu Pandan NEWater Plant; tonnes of refuse incinerated for WTE 

plants; and refrigeration tonnes per hour for our district heating and 

cooling plants.

12 Due to commercial sensitivity, data from Keppel Merlimau Cogen is 

excluded from the calculation of emissions intensity.

Environmental Management

Carbon Emissions13 

In 2017, total direct emissions from the  

use of fuels across the Group and the 

incineration of waste at WTE plants 

amounted to 1,065,179 t-CO2, a decrease 

from 1,205,749 t-CO2 in 2016, while  

indirect emissions from electricity  

use was 228,551 t-CO2, which is a 2% 

increase from 224,146 t-CO2 in 2016.

The increase in indirect emissions was  

due mainly to the inclusion of two new 

entities in our reporting boundary, 

SingSpring Desalination Plant and  

the Basslink Interconnector, and was 

partially offset by various energy  

efficiency initiatives implemented across 

the Group. Excluding these two facilities, 

the Group’s indirect emissions in 2017  

was 200,443 t-CO2.

Direct emissions for Singapore operations 

was 838,666 t-CO2, a 19% decrease  

from 1,031,948 t-CO2 in 2016. The slight 

decrease in direct emissions was due 

mainly to the combination of green 

initiatives such as the replacement of  

diesel generators at our shipyards with 

electricity or renewable energy, as well  

as reduced yard activities. Indirect 

emissions from our Singapore operations 

was 193,615 t-CO2.

Other Emissions &amp; Effluents

Keppel Infrastructure continues to actively 

manage the emissions from its operations. 

Nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide 

emitted from the three plants under  

Keppel Infrastructure remain far below  

the emission standards of 700 milligrams  

per normal cubic metre (mg/Nm3) and  

500 mg/Nm3 respectively, as stipulated 

by Singapore’s National Environment Agency 

(NEA) Code of Practice on Pollution Control.

In 2017, dust or particulate matter emitted  

by Senoko WTE Plant and Keppel Seghers 

Tuas WTE Plant were 17.58 mg/Nm3 and  

8.55 mg/Nm3 respectively, which were  

well below the NEA emission standard  

of 100 mg/Nm3. Variations in emissions  

are dependent on the type of municipal 

refuse incinerated by the plants. 

All trade effluent from our operations  

are treated and discharged to water  

courses or sewer systems in accordance  

with the environmental discharge limits  

and effluent standards in the countries  

of operation. 

Compliance

GRI 306-3 / 307-1 

There were no reports of spillages,  

and no sanctions pertaining to spillages  

that were administered by Singapore  

or overseas authorities on the Group  

in 2017.

During the year, a main contractor  

appointed by Keppel Land for the 

development of a residential project in 

Singapore was fined $5,000 for noise 

pollution at the construction site.  

Mitigating actions have since been  

taken to prevent recurrence.

13 The GHG conversion factors used for Scope 1  

(direct emissions) are based on the United 

Kingdom's DEFRA 2017 Government GHG 

Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.  

The GHG conversion factors for Scope 2 (indirect 

emissions) are based on the "Electricity Grid 

Emission Factor" for 2017 from the Energy Market 

Authority. The GHG emission Scopes 1, 2 and 3 are 

defined by the GHG Protocol, whereby Scope 1  

refers to emissions from company owned and 

operated facilities, machines, vehicles, etc.;  

Scope 2 refers to emissions from the generation of 

purchased electricity consumed by the company; 

Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the 

activities of the company, but occur from sources 

not owned or controlled by the company, such as 

employee commuting, business travel and the 

purchase of office supplies. The Group does not 

report on Scope 3 emissions as the boundaries  

for such emissions are very broad, and it is 

presently not feasible to track such data for a 

credible Scope 3 assessment. 

 

 

As there is no existing international benchmark 

on the amount of carbon emissions from the 

incineration of waste, Keppel has established a 

methodology for estimating carbon emissions 

based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 

GHG Inventories (Volume 5 – Waste). Carbon 

emissions are estimated based on the fossil  

carbon arising from the incineration of  

non-organic waste content in the incineration 

plant, which is dry plastics in Singapore's context. 

The plastics content and the moisture content in 

the waste are determined through annual refuse 

sampling, which is a requirement by NEA for the 

annual incineration capacity test for each plant.   

The carbon emission factors for 2017 are one tonne  

of waste incinerated equals to 0.3139 t-CO2 for 

Keppel Seghers Tuas WTE Plant, and  0.4283 t-CO2 

for Senoko WTE Plant.

Green Data Centres 



Special Focus

Through sustainable design and green technologies,  

we aim to reduce the environmental impact of our data centres. 

Rapid growth in data creation and the 

energy-intensive nature of the data centre 

industry have given rise to the increasing 

need for more energy-efficient green 

data centre technologies and solutions. 

Sustainable Design 

Keppel Data Centres incorporates 

environmentally-friendly features into  

its data centres’ design and construction. 

In 2017, Keppel DC Singapore 4 (KDC SGP 4)  

received three green certifications by 

the Building and Construction Authority 

(BCA), the Info-communications Media 

Development Authority (IMDA) and the 

US Green Building Council. This includes 

the BCA-IMDA Green Mark Award 

(Platinum) for New Data Centres,  

BCA Green Mark Award (Platinum) for  

Non-residential New Buildings and LEED 

Gold for Core and Shell development.

The green features of KDC SGP 4 include 

energy-efficient systems such as a chilled 

water cooling system and a dynamic rotary  

uninterruptible power system with 

distributed redundant configuration, and  

a combination of multi-compressor chillers 

and centrifugal chillers to optimise 

efficiency at different load conditions. 

The facility is designed for modularity 

and scalability, which allows for phased 

fit-out works to optimise usage of power.

Strategic Partnerships 

In 2017, Keppel Data Centres Holding 

(KDCH) entered into several strategic 

partnerships to explore green innovations 

in data centre design, space and systems. 

KDCH signed a Memorandum of 

Understanding with Huawei to 

collaborate on data centre efficiency 

and sustainability in the areas of 

green technology, high performance 

computing, scientific software application 

and networking solutions, amongst 

others. Following this collaboration,  

a Cognitive Data Centre reference site 

was launched to explore technologies 

geared towards providing virtualised 

and energy-efficient data centre 

management systems.

and air pollution significantly while 

also reducing costs. The world’s first 

successful waterborne data centre 

prototype, incorporating Nautilus’ 

patented water-cooling technology, 

was launched in 2015.

Together with Nautilus, Keppel T&amp;T 

will be able to expand its suite of 

innovative solutions for data centre 

technology. Keppel T&amp;T is also 

exploring opportunities to collaborate 

with other parts of the Group, such 

as Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine, which 

brings to the table a strong track  

record in the design and production  

of floating platforms.

KDCH also signed a Letter of Intent with 

IMDA and Huawei to collaborate and  

explore the deployment of a high-rise 

green data centre that features  

energy-efficient technologies.

In 2017, Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation (Keppel T&amp;T) invested  

US$10 million in the Series C preferred  

stock funding of Nautilus, which is 

engaged in the business of developing 

water-cooled data centres, including  

pre-fabricated, vessel-based facilities  

that can be rapidly deployed globally. 

By eliminating the need for energy-

intensive cooling, water-cooled data 

centres can reduce carbon emissions

has built up critical knowledge for handling 

materials at extremely low temperatures. 

This experience, coupled with a strong track 

record in oil and gas projects, has enabled 

Keppel to achieve many firsts in the delivery 

of LNG solutions. 

In 2017, Keppel O&amp;M signed a Heads of 

Agreement with Pavilion Energy and PLN 

to explore the development of small-scale 

LNG solutions for West Indonesia. FueLNG, 

Keppel O&amp;M’s joint venture with Shell, also 

achieved its first commercial LNG bunker 

transfer in Singapore by completing truck-

to-ship bunkering for Hilli Episeyo. The FLNG 

vessel has since been delivered to Golar 

LNG in 2017 for operations in offshore Kribi, 

Cameroon and is scheduled to commence 

commercial operations in 1H 2018.

Keppel AmFELS in Texas, USA, broke into 

the captive Jones Act market and secured a 

contract worth more than US$400 million 

from Pasha Hawaii for the construction of 

two dual-fuel containerships to be built to 

Keppel’s proprietary design. The vessels 

are expected to be delivered in 2020. They 

will be able to run completely on LNG fuel, 

reducing their environmental impact and 

increasing fuel efficiency. Energy savings 

will also be achieved with a state-of-the-art 

engine, an optimised hull form and  

an underwater propulsion system with a  

high-efficiency rudder and propeller.

Strengthening its track record as a provider 

of LNG solutions, Keppel Singmarine secured 

a contract worth over $100 million to build 

two LNG carrier vessels for Stolt-Nielsen Gas. 

The LNG carriers, which are expected to be 

completed in 2019, will be built in Keppel 

Nantong, China.

To streamline operations and effectively 

capture new opportunities, Keppel O&amp;M 

reorganised its operations into two divisions 

– the New Builds Division, covering Offshore 

as well as Gas &amp; Specialised Vessels, and the 

Conversions &amp; Repairs Division.

The reorganisation integrated key functions 

in the New Builds Division, allowing  

Keppel O&amp;M to improve efficiency and 

better leverage synergies and different 

capabilities of Keppel FELS and Keppel 

Singmarine. Keppel Shipyard can similarly 

draw on the Conversions &amp; Repairs Division's 

diverse resources to undertake a wider 

variety of complex projects. Through these 

efforts, Keppel O&amp;M is able to achieve 

greater efficiency and provide customers 

with even more competitive and reliable  

end-to-end solutions.

Property 

Keppel Land continued to proactively  

review and seek opportunities to recycle  

its assets to seek higher returns. In 2017, 

Keppel Land announced five divestments 

worth about $1 billion. In tandem,  

Keppel Land made nine acquisitions  

totaling about $1.6 billion, including 

residential sites in Singapore, China, 

Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, as well  

as an office and retail mixed-use 

development in Shanghai, China.

set the benchmark for all new Singapore 

developments and overseas commercial 

projects to be certified to the BCA Green Mark 

GoldPLUS standard, or its equivalent, and 

for all overseas residential developments 

to be certified to the BCA Green Mark 

Gold standard, or its equivalent. All newly 

acquired completed commercial buildings 

are also to be certified to the BCA Green 

Mark Gold standard, or its equivalent,  

within two years1.

Keppel Land also received top accolades  

at the Euromoney Real Estate Awards, 

including Best Overall Developer for 

Singapore, Vietnam and Myanmar. The 

annual Euromoney Real Estate Awards, 

which is open to both local and international 

companies, ranks the best developers, advisors, 

banks and investment managers globally. 

With rising real estate costs and smart 

technology transforming the way we work,  

co-working spaces have become increasingly 

popular globally. Co-working provides an 

innovative alternative to traditional office 

spaces, riding on the shared economy. 

To meet the growing demand in this niche 

market, Keppel Land launched KLOUD, a 

new generation serviced co-office catering 

to companies looking for flexible spaces. 

Keppel Land’s flagship co-office KLOUD 

Keppel Bay Tower boasts 18,000 square  

feet (sf) of smart office space. Since its 

opening, the co-working space has attracted 

start-ups, small and medium-sized

Management. 

With a larger and integrated asset 

management platform, Keppel Capital  

is delivering stronger performance. On a 

fully leveraged and invested basis, total 

assets under management reached  

$29 billion as at end-2017, up from  

$25 billion as at end-2016. 

In November 2017, the Keppel-KBS US 

REIT was listed on the Main Board of the 

Singapore Exchange, raising gross proceeds 

of approximately US$553 million. The REIT 

has a portfolio of 11 quality investment 

assets in key US growth markets, and drew 

positive demand from institutional and  

retail investors during the international 

placement and public offering.

Fostering Innovation 

Keppel Technology &amp; Innovation (KTI) was 

launched to be a catalyst for change by 

sharpening the Group’s focus on innovation. 

As a platform for co-creating and incubating 

ideas, KTI leverages the strong expertise, 

experience and track record of Keppel Offshore 

&amp; Marine Technology Centre (KOMtech). 

In 2017, KOMtech received the inaugural 

National Supercomputing Centre 

Outstanding High Performance Computing 

Industry Application Award for its  

research and commercial efforts to tap 

computational power to drive innovation 

and raise productivity. 

In 2017, Keppel O&amp;M undertook the 

development of conceptual designs of  

various floating solutions, such as a 

Cable Laying Vessel, Low Motion Semi-

submersible, and Floating, Storage and 

Re-gasification Unit power barges, as well 

as the repurposing of offshore technology 

through the development of a floating 

desalination plant, and an aquaculture  

and offshore logistics hub. 

Keppel Logistics successfully launched  

the use of Smart Glasses to streamline 

inbound and outbound tasks for all 

customers at the Automated Storage  

and Retrieval System warehouse.  

The use of Smart Glasses leads to higher 

operational efficiency and stock-take 

accuracy, as compared to conventional 

radio frequency scanners. In addition,  

the company continued to transition  

from paper-based to mobile-based  

stock-taking, which contributed to 

significant lead-time reduction and 

enhanced data accuracy. The company’s 

operations in Australia, Indonesia,  

Malaysia and Vietnam also completed  

a Warehouse Management System  

upgrade during the year. 

UrbanFox has embarked on a collaboration 

with the Singapore Management University 

– Fujitsu - A*Star’s Centre of Excellence,  

to study the travelling patterns of  

delivery personnel so that orders can 

be matched efficiently on Urbanfox’s 

crowdsourcing platform.

Building Sustainable Cities 



Special Focus

The Sino-Singapore  

Tianjin Eco-City is developed 

in accordance with a 

comprehensive set of  

Key Performance Indicators 

that cover various aspects  

of sustainability.

The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City 

(Eco-City) is on track to realise its vision 

of becoming a model for sustainable 

urbanisation in China. Leading the Singapore 

consortium, Keppel works with its Chinese 

partner to guide the 50-50 joint venture – 

Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City Investment 

and Development Co., Ltd. (SSTEC) – in its 

role as master developer of the Eco-City.

The Eco-City, which celebrates its 10th 

anniversary in 2018, has transformed 

from a barren, saline and alkaline site to 

an emerging green city that has been 

lauded for its eco-friendly features, 

such as green transport, renewable 

energy, green buildings as well as waste 

reduction and recycling initiatives. The 

Eco-City is developed in accordance with 

a comprehensive set of Key Performance 

Indicators that cover various aspects of 

sustainability, including environmentally 

friendly buildings, green transportation,  

use of renewable energy as well as social 

and economic factors. 

The Eco-City has received numerous 

accolades, including being named 

China’s first National Green Development 

Demonstration Zone, first Integrated  

Smart-Grid Demonstration Zone and 

National Green Building Base. The Low 

Carbon Living Lab, which is the first  

building in China to be awarded the  

Green Mark Platinum Award by the  

Building &amp; Construction Authority of 

Singapore, encourages test-bedding and 

demonstration of green building features, 

energy-saving building technologies and 

renewable energy adoption.

Steady Progress 

To date, over 80,000 people live and  

work in the Eco-City, which boasts over 

6,000 registered companies1, 17 schools 

with close to 10,000 students, three 

neighbourhood centres, four libraries, 

three health services centres and a hospital 

among its amenities. Construction of the 

new Z4 rail line is on track for completion 

in 2020, and will connect the Eco-City to 

surrounding regions. 

Demand for the Eco-City’s homes remained 

strong in 2017, with over 4,000 homes  

sold despite a series of cooling measures 

driving a softening of Tianjin’s overall 

home sales market. Reflecting the market’s 

growing confidence in the Eco-City, three 

residential land parcels were sold at around 

RMB 13,800 per square metre of gross floor 

area at a land auction in early-2017. 

With the focus of the Eco-City's development 

shifting to the Central District, SSTEC has 

embarked on a new urban design scheme 

for the district, which will become the main 

commercial, hotel and recreation hub of  

the Eco-City. Meanwhile, work on the  

Sino-Singapore Friendship Garden and  

Sino-Singapore Friendship Library  

is on-going. 

In February 2017, Singapore’s Deputy  

Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and  

Minister for National Development and 

Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong 

met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing  

for the Joint Steering Council meeting, 

affirming the Eco-City’s progress. 

Providing Urban Solutions 

The various business units of the  

Keppel Group continued to contribute 

towards the growth of the Eco-City by 

providing solutions for urban living,  

clean environments and connectivity. 

In 2017, Keppel Land China sold 1,017  

homes in the Eco-City. As at end-December 

2017, Keppel’s Seasons Garden has sold  

97% of its 1,190 units, Seasons Residences 

has sold over 62% of its 380 launched  

units, and Seasons Heights has sold all  

of its 124 launched units. Meanwhile, 

Waterfront Residences was almost fully  

sold as at end-December 2017.

maintained its occupancy at an  

average of 65% for 2017. 

The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City 

Water Reclamation Centre, a joint 

venture between Keppel Infrastructure 

and Tianjin Eco-City Investment and 

Development Co., Ltd, was officially 

opened by Singapore's Deputy Prime 

Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in 

June 2017. The Centre treats wastewater 

effluent from an existing wastewater 

treatment plant to produce recycled 

water that meets China’s most stringent 

standards for urban miscellaneous  

water consumption.

As the Eco-City continues to mature,  

the Group will continue to leverage  

the competencies of its various 

businesses to contribute to the  

Eco-City’s development, and  

strengthen the Group’s track record 

of being a solutions provider for

Safety &amp; Health

Best Practice 

Our safety management system is routinely 

audited by independent consultants as  

well as internal audit teams. For example, 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine’s (Keppel O&amp;M) 

Cross Business Unit Audit ensures that 

policies and management systems are 

adhered to and that practices across our 

global yards are aligned.

Our business units also strive to achieve 

HSE certifications in line with global best 

practices. Most of our key business units 

and worksites, both in Singapore and 

overseas, are certified to the OHSAS 18001 

Occupational Safety &amp; Health Management 

System and the ISO 14001 Environmental 

Management System. 

As part of continuous improvement efforts, 

we are working to meet the requirements 

under the new ISO 45001 Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety Management System, 

which provides a robust and effective set 

of processes for improving safety in global 

supply chains. 

Board &amp; Management Oversight 

Keppel Corporation is the first publicly listed 

company in Singapore to establish a Board 

Safety Committee (BSC) in 2006.

Chaired by Tan Ek Kia, a non-executive and 

independent director of Keppel Corporation, 

the BSC adopts a hands-on approach 

in setting the strategic direction and 

establishing a safety framework to ensure 

that consistently high safety standards are 

maintained across our business units. 

The BSC leads efforts to implement 

initiatives and improve performance with 

the support of the Inter-Strategic Business 

Unit Safety Committee, which comprises 

representatives from all our business units. 

The Committee is chaired by R K Jaggi, 

General Manager of Group HSE,  

Keppel Corporation. 

Keppel Corporation’s BSC as well as the  

BSCs and senior management of the  

various business units conduct regular  

site visits to yards, plants, worksites, offices 

and facilities to engage operational staff, 

understand the challenges they face on the 

ground, and reinforce key safety messages 

and guidelines.

In March 2017, senior management  

from Keppel Corporation visited Keppel 

Infrastructure Trust’s Senoko Waste-to-Energy 

Plant. The group inspected safety processes 

at the plant and was briefed on the plant’s

GRI 403-2

Our business units abide by the Workplace

Injury Compensation Act by Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower (MOM), which requires 

employers to report workplace accidents, 

dangerous occurrences and occupational 

diseases to MOM1.

Empowering Lives


At worksites, safety stand-downs are 

conducted when incidents occur or when 

hazards are spotted. Reportable incidents 

and near misses are also promptly reported 

to senior management.  

As a result of our concerted efforts, our 

Accident Severity Rate (ASR) and Accident 

Frequency Rate (AFR) decreased in 2017. 

In 2017, despite our best efforts, we suffered 

three fatalities globally and reported a 

total ASR of 140 man-days lost per million 

man-hours, compared to 254 the year 

before. ASR for our direct workforce was 

233 man-days lost per million man-hours, 

while ASR for our contract workforce was 

80 man-days lost per million man-hours.

We are deeply saddened by the loss of  

our colleagues and have thoroughly 

investigated the root causes, which were 

related to working in the Line of Fire and  

Heavy Vehicles. We determined the 

contributing factors and identified steps 

to prevent similar incidents in the future. 

Lessons learnt were shared across the Group. 

Our total AFR for 2017 decreased to 0.10 

accidents per million man-hours from  

0.15 the year before. AFR for our direct 

workforce was 0.12 accidents per million 

man-hours, while AFR for our contract 

workforce was 0.09 accidents per million 

man-hours. 

As the members of our workforce who  

are exposed to health and safety risks  

are largely male, the presentation of AFR  

and ASR data according to gender was 

assessed to be immaterial. 

Recognition 

The Group was conferred 36 WSH Awards  

in 2017 by MOM and Singapore’s WSH 

Council. This is the highest number of 

awards won by a single organisation  

this year. 

Of the 36 awards, Keppel O&amp;M received  

28 awards under the Safety and Health 

Award Recognition for Projects category, 

which recognises companies with good 

project safety and health management 

systems.

Keppel FELS and Keppel Singmarine, 

subsidiaries of Keppel O&amp;M, also clinched 

the WSH Performance (Silver) Awards 

for exemplary safety performances 

and implementation of strong WSH 

management systems.

Keppel Merlimau Cogen, Keppel FELS, 

Keppel DHCS and Keppel Logistics garnered 

WSH Innovation Awards, which recognise 

companies for their efforts in creating 

solutions which help to improve safety  

at the workplace (see page 67).

In addition, Saravanan Marimuthu, Senior 

Welding Superintendent at Keppel FELS,  

and Mani Rajasekaran, Assistant Control  

and Instrument Engineer at Keppel Merlimau 

Cogen, received the Supervisor Awards  

for their exemplary performances in 

ensuring a safe working environment for 

workers under their charge.

Keppel FELS received the Safety Initiative 

Award at the Seatrade Maritime Awards

on safety measures and best practices. 

In 2017, we invested approximately  

$28 million in enhancing safety-related 

infrastructure, upgrading systems and 

building knowledge and skillsets across  

the Group.

Our commitment to innovation extends  

to improving the safety of work processes. 

At the 11th annual Keppel Group Safety 

Convention, 34 Safety Innovation Projects 

were submitted, paving the way for solutions 

to be further developed into actual products. 

Some of the entries went on to compete at 

both industry and national levels and have 

since garnered awards. 

The Keppel Safety Training Centre at  

Keppel Shipyard in Singapore offers a 

complete range of safety training and 

certification courses in both trade specific 

and broad-based skills for all levels of the 

workforce. The Centre is equipped with 

classrooms, an e-learning zone, and a hall 

with multimedia and interactive training 

stations. It also features a life-size replica 

of the mid-section of a tanker with various 

technical training areas. Core competency 

and safety leadership development 

programmes, as well as Workforce Skills 

Qualifications courses certified by the 

Singapore Workforce Development Agency, 

are some of the key training modules 

conducted by qualified, full-time instructors 

at the Centre. 

Keppel Land’s SACs in Ho Chi Minh City, 

Vietnam; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; Jakarta, 

Indonesia and Tianjin, China, provide 

mandatory training for contractors’ 

employees and foster a culture of safety 

across Keppel Land’s supply chain.  

Keppel Land is currently developing a  

mobile SAC to be launched in Wuxi, China.

Keppel Land’s Behavioural Management  

of Safety programme is in place for projects 

in Singapore and China. The programme 

uses behavioural strategies to improve  

work processes. 

To promote safer driving, Keppel Logistics 

organised Defensive Driving courses for  

its drivers. 

Recognising Safe Behaviour 

On 7 November 2017, over 450 employees, 

partners, contractors and subcontractors 

reaffirmed their collective commitment  

to safety at the 11th edition of the Keppel 

Group Safety Convention with the theme, 

‘Driving HSE Excellence as OneKeppel’. 

Gracing the event as Guest-of-Honour  

was Ho Siong Hin, Commissioner for  

WSH, MOM. The convention also saw  

the continuation of the annual Keppel  

Group Safety Awards which recognised  

21 employees who have gone the extra  

mile to enhance safety at their worksites. 

The convention also featured a lively  

sharing session by seven frontline managers 

who discussed how employees can take 

action to reinforce safety at work and  

at home.

Enhancing Communication 

Keppel’s five Key Safety Principles are 

widely publicised so as to ingrain safety 

consciousness among all stakeholders.  

The Group HSE Alerts system was 

established to better disseminate lessons 

learnt globally and ensure that preventive 

measures are taken promptly. 

Major incidents are also shared and 

discussed at quarterly BSC meetings.  

Keppel O&amp;M’s HSE team unveiled its Life 

Saving Rules in 2016 to provide employees, 

frontline workers in particular, with  

guidance on preventive measures to  

keep themselves safe. 

Keppel FELS held its annual month-long  

HSE Excellence Promotion campaign in 

August 2017. Themed, ‘Safety in Mind, 

Responsibility is Mine’, the campaign aimed 

to inculcate a strong safety mindset in 

workers through briefings, safety poster 

competitions and games. 

In May 2017, about 200 of Keppel Land’s 

board members, senior management, 

contractors, consultants and staff came 

together to reaffirm their commitment 

to safety and to share best practices at 

Keppel Land’s Workplace Safety and Health 

Recognition Event 2017. In China, a similar 

convention was held in Shanghai during the 

same month, where over 190 employees, 

customers and contractors exchanged 

experiences and ideas to strive for an 

incident-free workplace.  

Keppel Infrastructure held its fourth  

annual HSE Roadshow in Singapore in 

February 2017. Around 300 employees  

and contractors were briefed on the 

company’s HSE performance in 2016,  

lessons learnt from recent HSE-related 

incidents, as well as targets and action  

plans for the year ahead. 

Keppel Housing, which manages the 

accommodation of our yards’ direct workers, 

regularly organises HSE Roadshows to 

empower residents with safety and health 

knowledge. The roadshow was supported 

by several government agencies, including 

MOM, the WSH Council and the Health 

Promotion Board.

Influencing our Supply Chain 

We work closely with all stakeholders, 

including our contractors and subcontractors, 

to maintain high safety standards 

throughout our workforce. Our subcontract 

workers undergo the same safety training  

as direct employees. 

To raise industry standards, we work closely 

with customers, suppliers, regulators and 

industry associations to implement initiatives 

and encourage our subcontractors to attend 

regular safety training. Keppel is also a 

sponsor of annual national safety events.

As part of the World Congress on Safety 

and Health at Work, Keppel O&amp;M hosted a 

delegation from the WSH Council on a visit 

to its facilities, including the Keppel Safety 

Training Centre and the Keppel Wellness 

Gallery, where delegates were introduced 

to initiatives such as the company’s High 

Impact Risk Activities training.

Health &amp; Wellness 

The Group promotes exercise programmes 

and healthy living campaigns to encourage 

employees to live active, balanced lifestyles. 

Keppel O&amp;M’s HSE personnel organise 

dormitory visits on a regular basis to reach 

out to workers on health and safety matters. 

Keppel Shipyard’s Well-Being and Support 

Centre is equipped with facilities such 

as a pharmacy, counselling rooms and 

designated rest areas, and offers holistic 

health and medical services. To provide 

workers with a conducive environment to 

rest during breaks, Keppel Shipyard built 

three 4-storey rest areas. Each rest area 

accommodates up to 2,000 workers.

On 10 February 2017, Keppel Shipyard 

officially opened the Keppel Wellness  

Gallery which features interactive health 

exhibits to educate employees on the 

importance of having proper nutrition,  

an active lifestyle and good mental health.  

During the opening ceremony, Keppel 

Shipyard also launched the Total  

Workplace Safety and Health 2020 

programme, a four-year strategic plan  

for an incident-free work environment.

At Keppel FELS, members of the 

Subcontractors Executive Council Safety 

Committee, comprising representatives  

of different trade sections including HSE,  

meet regularly to discuss safety initiatives 

and share best practices. 

As bizSAFE partners, Keppel Seghers,  

Keppel FELS, Keppel Shipyard and  

Keppel Singmarine actively encourage 

contractors to progress through the levels  

of the bizSAFE programme. Since 2013, 

Keppel Shipyard has imposed a bizSAFE 

Level 4 certification requirement for  

resident contractors before they are able  

to undertake work at the yard. 

As a bizSAFE Mentor, Keppel Land 

encourages contractors to develop and 

implement safety initiatives at their 

workplaces. Prior to their appointment, 

Keppel Land’s main contractors must be 

confirmed as bizSAFE partners, and  

ensure that their subcontractors meet  

the standards set by the WSH Council. 

Industry Sharing 

Keppel O&amp;M actively participates in  

HSE-related seminars and forums to  

share its experience and standards with 

stakeholders. 

In 2017, Keppel O&amp;M participated in the 

National Workplace Safety and Health 

Campaign and showcased projects  

such as the Coupler Repair Workbench, 

which won the WSH Innovation Award  

at the WSH Awards 2015.

Promoting Safety Innovations



Special Focus

Across the Keppel Group, 

we continue to develop 

innovative solutions to 

enhance safety.

In developing innovative and effective  

safety solutions, we aim to improve work 

processes and enhance safety. In 2017, 

Keppel Merlimau Cogen, Keppel FELS, 

Keppel DHCS and Keppel Logistics garnered 

Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) 

Innovation Awards at the WSH Awards 

organised by Singapore's WSH Council  

and Ministry of Manpower.

Keppel Merlimau Cogen, the operator of 

a power plant in Singapore, garnered the 

innovation award for its Sea Water Intake 

Guide Cleaning project, which improved 

safety by eliminating the use of divers to 

clean the power plant's stop gate guides.  

Its mechanical spring-loaded scraper  

shaved off barnacles and marine growth 

effectively, improving efficiency and helping 

to achieve cost savings of about $80,000  

per annum. 

Keppel FELS received the innovation award 

for the Handy Bolt and Nut Tightener, which 

improved work productivity and reduced 

the risk of finger injuries. Its spring lock 

mechanism can be adjusted to fit bolts and 

nuts of different sizes, and its neodymium 

alloy magnets firmly secure the bolt and 

nut in place during the tightening and 

dismantling of flanged pipe connections.

Keppel DHCS, a subsidiary of Keppel 

Infrastructure, clinched the innovation award 

for its Multi-Purpose Lifter, which reduced 

the risk of musculoskeletal injuries from the 

lifting of heavy manhole covers, and the risk 

of workers falling into the valve chamber 

during the maintenance and inspection  

of district cooling systems. 

Keppel Logistics won the innovation award 

for redesigning the manual and laborious 

process of cable cutting and re-spooling. 

The project reduced the risk of injuries 

and improved productivity by 30% by 

implementing changes such as lowering  

the height of the re-spooling unit, recreating 

the cable cutting unit with metal guard 

panels to prevent the drum from rolling over, 

and installing a full rotational function to 

make spooling the cables easier.

Empowering Lives


was 13.4% globally, an increase from  

12.3% in 2016. The increase is largely  

due to the headwinds faced in the  

offshore and marine industry, which  

led to some employees exploring  

alternative options.  

Management Approach 

GRI 102-41 / 103-1 / 103-2 / 103-3 /  

401-2 / 401-3 / 404-3 / 406-1

We respect and uphold human rights 

principles, adhere to fair employment 

practices, and invest in developing and 

training our workforce. In doing so, we 

enhance our ability to attract and retain  

the best talent and grow the capabilities  

of our people. 

In 2018, Keppel Corporation became a 

signatory of the United Nations (UN) Global 

Compact. Keppel is committed to the 

Compact's 10 universal principles, which 

include principles on human rights and 

labour practices.

Human Rights 

Keppel Corporation and our Group of 

Companies uphold and respect the 

fundamental principles set out in the  

UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

and the International Labour Organisation’s 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 

Rights at Work. Our approach to human 

rights is informed and guided by general 

concepts from the UN Guiding Principles on 

Business and Human Rights. 

Overview 

People are our most valuable asset.  

We believe in investing in our workforce  

and developing our employees to their 

fullest potential. 

Our total workforce, comprising full and  

part-time permanent employees and 

excluding our contractor workforce, was 

21,421 as at end 2017, spread across more 

than 20 countries. The data reported in 

this section takes into account significant 

subsidiaries and associated companies 

in which the Group has a stake that is 

equivalent to 51% or more.   

In response to a challenging business 

environment, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

(Keppel O&amp;M) continued its rightsizing 

efforts to streamline operations and reduce 

overheads. During the year, Keppel O&amp;M’s 

direct global staff strength was reduced 

by about 25% from end 2016, while its 

subcontract workforce in Singapore came 

down by about 23% in the same period. 

Where possible, we redeploy manpower to 

other business units within Keppel where 

additional resources are required. Such 

redeployment opportunities are proactively 

communicated to the affected workers. 

The age profile of our workforce is largely 

young, with 24.9% of employees under the 

age of 30, and 39.2% between the ages of 

30 and 39. During the year, 2,116 people 

were hired. Overall voluntary turnover rate

SDGs highlighted in this section


Labour Practices &amp; Human Rights

We have zero tolerance for unethical  

labour practices such as child labour,  

forced labour, slavery and human trafficking 

in all of our operations. Keppel also  

supports the elimination of exploitative 

labour. Our suppliers are expected to 

abide by the Keppel Supplier Code of 

Conduct, which holds them accountable  

for responsible labour practices in  

their operations.

Our commitment to human rights is 

supported by our Employee Code of 

Conduct, which sets the tone in relation to 

the Group’s stance against discrimination 

on any basis, inclusive of any bias on the 

basis of ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, 

nationality, age or any physical disability. 

The rules of conduct apply to all employees 

of Keppel Corporation and its subsidiary 

companies. Our stance on human rights  

is articulated in our Corporate Statement  

on Human Rights which is publicly  

available online. 

Unions are our partners and we place great 

emphasis on maintaining a harmonious 

and collaborative relationship with them. 

Approximately 33.6% of our global workforce 

are bargainable employees covered by 

Collective Agreements (CA). 

Guidelines are in place for the appropriate 

management of grievance cases. For 

unionised companies, employee grievances 

are resolved according to the grievance 

handling protocol spelt out in the  

respective CA. 

All registered grievances are investigated 

and tracked through to final closure.  

In the case of a grievance, our management  

and the union will undertake every 

reasonable effort to resolve the employee’s 

grievance promptly. 

Across our businesses worldwide, there were 

29 grievance cases reported in 2017, all of 

which have been resolved. 

Fair Employment Policies &amp; Practices 

We adopt fair employment practices and 

comply with local labour regulations across 

our global operations, as well as minimum 

wage laws, where such laws exist. 

In Singapore, Keppel adheres to the Tripartite 

Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices 

and endorses the Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices, which is guided by 

the following five principles:

1. Recruit and select employees on the 

basis of merit (such as skills, experience 

or ability to perform the job), and 

regardless of age, race, gender, religion, 

marital status and family responsibilities, 

or disability.

2. Treat employees fairly and with respect 

and implement progressive human 

resource management systems. 

3. Provide employees with equal 

opportunity to be considered for 

training and development based on 

their strengths and needs to help them 

achieve their full potential. 

4. Reward employees fairly based on their 

ability, performance, contribution and 

experience. 

5. Comply with labour laws and abide 

by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair 

Employment Practices. 

Keppel subscribes to a pay-for-performance 

philosophy. We believe this drives ownership 

of collective goals and leads to a high-

performance culture that creates long-term 

shareholder value. 

Opportunities for advancement, promotion, 

recognition of achievements, compensation, 

training and other conditions of employment 

are provided based on merit. Regular 

performance reviews are conducted for  

all permanent employees. The process, 

undertaken jointly by the employee and 

supervisor, entails the setting of targets and 

a career developmental roadmap detailing 

work plans, training and measurable 

performance targets. 

Diversity &amp; Inclusion 

We believe that people should have access 

to the same opportunities regardless of  

their ethnicity, religion, gender, marital 

status or age. 

Our hiring policies ensure equal  

employment opportunities for all. New 

hires are considered based on individual 

competencies as well as organisational  

and job fit. Our employment statistics, 

reviewed regularly, illustrate the diversity  

of our workforce. As at 31 December 

2017, 17.8% of our employees are female, 

compared to 15.7% in 2016. We recognise 

that there are certain segments in our 

businesses, such as offshore and marine, 

which tend to attract larger proportions 

of male employees due to the nature 

of the jobs. At our corporate office and 

in certain segments of our businesses, 

such as investment, more than half of our 

employees are female. We value diversity 

and inclusion, and are committed to the 

principle of equal employment opportunity. 

We believe that hiring from local communities1 

enhances our ability to understand local 

needs and strengthen our capabilities on 

the ground. We also develop local talents to 

assume management positions. Across our 

business units, 66.9% of senior management 

and 60.7% of our employees are citizens 

or permanent residents of the countries in 

which they work.

Empowering Lives


Industry Programmes 

Underscoring our commitment to nurture 

human capital, the Group makes significant 

investments to equip employees with up-

to-date operational skills and certifications. 

We also partner with government bodies 

and educational institutions on initiatives 

targeted at grooming young talents. 

The Group has been an industry partner of 

the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) 

since 2012. The SgIS is a unique partnership 

between the Singapore government and 

prominent local enterprises that offers 

scholarships and internship opportunities 

to Singapore citizens pursuing their 

undergraduate studies in areas related to 

Singapore’s strategic sectors. 

Keppel O&amp;M’s Memorandum of 

Understanding with the Institute of Technical 

Education (ITE), Ngee Ann Polytechnic and 

Singapore Polytechnic supports the skills 

and career development of students in the 

offshore and marine engineering sector.

Keppel O&amp;M’s Technical Associate and 

Assistant Technical Associate schemes  

are catered for trainees with GCE ‘N’ Level,  

GCE ‘O’ Level and ITE qualifications.  

Offered in collaboration with ITE, the 

extensive two-year work-and-study 

programme includes classroom learning, 

practical skills training, on-the-job training 

and soft skills training. In 2017, seven 

employees under this scheme completed 

their NITEC and Higher NITEC education. 

Grooming Leaders 

We offer scholarships and groom our 

scholars for roles across the Group according 

to their aspirations and qualifications. The 

Group also offers internships to promising 

tertiary students for them to gain work 

experience before entering the workplace. 

We support employees at all levels of the 

company in furthering their education.  

In 2017, the Group sponsored 23 employees 

in pursuing further studies. 

Keppel Young Leaders provides a centralised 

platform to nurture young talents across the  

Group. To cultivate innovative, entrepreneurial 

and global mindsets, Keppel Young Leaders 

are given opportunities to work on cross-

business assignments under the mentorship 

of senior management. Through annual 

symposiums, hackathon challenges and 

dialogue sessions with industry leaders, they 

build networks with peers in other business 

units and engage with senior management. 

The Group’s business units offer two-year  

management trainee or associate 

programmes to nurture fresh graduates  

who aspire and have the potential to take  

on management roles.

them with the capability and confidence to 

drive our businesses into the future. 

Since 2015, more than 90 promising 

employees from across the Group have 

participated in the Emerging Leaders 

Programme, which aims to strengthen core 

leadership skills. The Advanced Leaders 

Programme was also launched in 2017  

and had 23 participants across the Group. 

The programme focuses on areas that 

include change leadership, collaboration  

and innovation, and uses a combination  

of different learning approaches such as 

action learning projects, workshops, site 

visits and networking sessions.

Retaining Experience 

Keppel supports re-employability beyond 

the statutory retirement age. Eligible 

employees are offered post-retirement 

employment opportunities in Keppel, in line 

with the Singapore Tripartite Guidelines on 

the Re-employment of Older Employees.  

As at 31 December 2017, there were 256  

re-employed staff in the Group, of which  

61 were re-employed in 2017. 

Through initiatives such as the Keppel O&amp;M 

Alumni, employees past and present have 

been able to stay connected and benefit 

from meaningful networks. 

We also recognise retired members of  

the Keppel family, who have made valuable 

contributions to the growth of the company 

through the decades. In 2016, Keppel 

Fellows, an alumni comprising former board 

members of Keppel entities and selected 

members of senior management, was 

established to better engage distinguished 

former leaders, and tap their collective 

wisdom and experience. 

Employee Engagement

Employee Engagement Survey 

The biannual Keppel Global Employee 

Engagement Survey was conducted in 2017. 

The survey achieved a strong response rate 

of 98% from a sample size of over 5,000 

employees. The Group achieved a high 

engagement score, with 87% of employees 

surveyed indicating that they would  

“go beyond the norm” to contribute to 

Keppel’s success.

Enhancing Communication 

Various staff engagement initiatives are 

organised throughout the year to enhance 

communication between management and  

staff. The third edition of the Global Keppelites 

Forum, a group-wide town hall meeting, was 

held in February 2017. The event, which was  

also broadcast online, reached out to over 

2,600 employees in over 70 locations globally.

During the session, Loh Chin Hua, Chief 

Executive Officer of Keppel Corporation, 

shared on the Group’s overall performance, 

strategy and priorities. Employees also took 

this opportunity to pose questions to a panel 

comprising senior management from across 

the Keppel Group. 

Employees are updated on the company’s 

performance and strategic directions at 

regular staff dialogue sessions organised by 

Keppel Corporation and our business units. 

Informal sessions, such as breakfast and 

afternoon tea meetings, as well as regular 

outdoor activities, provide opportunities 

for employees to interact with senior 

management. 

Orientation sessions for new hires in 2017 

included dialogue sessions with senior 

management. New hires are also assigned 

buddies who help them assimilate and 

guide their professional development. 

Building Strong Teams 

We believe that cohesive teams are integral 

to a productive workforce. We continue 

to build camaraderie among employees 

through various platforms, such as Keppel 

Games, a series of sports competitions 

initiated by Keppelite Recreation Club, as 

well as volunteer activities organised by 

Keppel Volunteers.

Supporting National Defence 

We believe in contributing towards 

Singapore’s national security.  

National Service (NS) is a vital component

Award, conferred for a period of three years, 

is the highest accolade acknowledging 

businesses for their exemplary support 

towards Total Defence and in particular, NS.

We are committed to the well-being of 

our entire workforce. This includes foreign 

workers who live and work away from  

their families. 

Keppel O&amp;M provides high-quality 

dormitories for our directly employed  

foreign workers in Singapore. These 

dormitories offer a range of amenities and 

recreational facilities. Activities, such as 

talent search competitions, are organised 

to promote harmonious living and bonding. 

Keppel Housing, which houses our yards’

against each other to present ground-

breaking new ideas around the theme of 

digitalisation. 

Prior to the symposium, a series of 

TechConnect talks were organised for

Conserving Biodiversity 

The Keppel Discovery Wetlands at the 

Singapore Botanic Gardens was officially 

opened in March 2017 by Prime Minister  

of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong. Established 

with a $2.08 million commitment from 

Keppel, the Wetlands includes a plant 

collection of over 200 species, and for the 

first time, visitors can enjoy a freshwater 

forest wetland in the heart of the city.  

Since its launch, over 600,000 people have 

visited the Wetlands. Keppel Volunteers 

serve as ambassadors for the Wetlands by 

leading tours for students and seniors to 

promote conservation.

Other environmental initiatives include 

Keppel Volunteers’ participation in BioBlitz, 

a national biodiversity survey at various 

locations including the Keppel Discovery 

Wetlands, and in beach clean-up events  

in Singapore and overseas. 

Raising Eco-Consciousness 

Keppel demonstrated its support for climate 

action by participating in Earth Hour 2017. 

Non-essential lights at various shipyards, 

plants and buildings were turned off for an 

hour, and activities were organised to raise 

awareness on climate change.

Keppel Land was a strategic partner of 

Ricoh’s Eco-Action Day for the fourth 

consecutive year, while Keppel REIT  

came on board as the official Building 

Sponsor. Eco-Action Day roadshows were 

held at Keppel Land and Keppel REIT  

office lobbies, and Keppel employees  

shared environmentally-friendly tips for  

the home and workplace with tenants  

and visitors.  

To raise environmental awareness among 

the younger generation, volunteers from 

Keppel Land organised a museum tour and 

naturalist workshop for underprivileged 

children at the Lee Kong Chian National 

History Museum. 

As part of Keppel Land China’s environmental 

outreach initiatives, Keppel Volunteers 

organise regular school tours to the 

Chenshan Botanical Gardens in Shanghai, 

China, to provide students with exposure to 

native biodiversity.

Promoting Workforce Development 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M)  

and Keppel Logistics are both participants 

of the Singapore Workforce Development 

Agency’s ‘SkillsFuture Earn and Learn’ 

programme. Through on-the-job  

training and career placements, the 

programme aims to enhance the skills  

and employability of students in the  

offshore and marine engineering as well  

as logistics sectors. 

In 2017, Keppel Data Centres partnered 

Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) 

to offer the ‘Integrated Work Study’ 

programme, which entails a one-year job 

attachment for students.

In the Philippines, Keppel Batangas Shipyard 

offers out-of-school youth full scholarships 

in technical trades such as shielded metal 

arc welding and structural fitting. Training 

is conducted at the Keppel Batangas 

Training Centre. Upon completion of the 

apprenticeship programme, youth are 

offered employment opportunities with  

the shipyard or its subcontractors. In 2017,  

65 scholarships were awarded. 

Promoting Education 

Inclusive, quality education can lift 

communities out of poverty by helping 

children create brighter futures for 

themselves and their families. By improving 

access to education, we empower children 

who are marginalised.

Since its inception in 2012, Keppel Care 

Foundation has disbursed over $11 million 

to educational causes, which include 

scholarships and bursaries for students of 

local universities and institutes of higher 

learning. With Keppel’s contribution, over 

200 deserving students from low-income 

families have been awarded scholarships, 

academic awards, bursaries and study 

grants. These include the Keppel Bursary 

and Keppel Engineering Bursary offered by 

the National University of Singapore;

Arts Advocate 

We believe that the arts inspire, contribute 

towards civic engagement and social 

cohesion, and build bridges between 

cultures. Through supporting the arts,  

we aim to stimulate the cross-fertilisation  

of ideas, and foster creativity and expression. 

This will in turn contribute to the vibrancy  

of our communities. 

Keppel supported the International Committee 

for Museums and Collections of Modern Art 

Annual Conference 2017 hosted by National 

Gallery Singapore. Over 280 contemporary 

art professionals from 50 countries attended 

the conference, which was held in Southeast 

Asia for the first time and explored the role 

of museums in civil society.  

Singapore’s National Arts Council awarded 

Keppel Corporation its 10th consecutive 

Distinguished Patron of the Arts Award 

in 2017, in recognition of the Company’s 

contribution to Singapore’s art scene.

introduce visual literacy, analytical and 

interpretive skills to students. In 2017,  

several key spaces at the Centre were 

refreshed with new exhibits incorporating 

elements that cultivate a sense of  

curiosity and exploration among children 

(see page 86).

Keppel Nights 

In March 2018, Keppel announced its 

commitment of $500,000 over three years  

to Keppel Nights, renewing its partnership 

with Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay to 

nurture a deeper appreciation of the arts 

among students in Singapore (see page 87). 

Since 2013, the partnership has provided 

about 20,000 students from more than  

70 schools in the heartlands with access  

to arts and cultural shows presented  

by Esplanade. 

Keppel Nights also includes an element of 

experiential learning, with dance, music and 

drama workshops that give students the 

chance to try out various art and cultural 

forms and get a taste of performing. 

Nurturing Communities 

Keppel supports Community Chest in its 

fundraising efforts to support a wide range 

of social service organisations that reach 

out to the disadvantaged in society. Keppel 

business units including Keppel FELS, 

Keppel Shipyard, Keppel Singmarine and 

Keppel Logistics have been strong partners 

of Community Chest’s SHARE, a monthly 

giving programme. The Keppel Group has 

contributed over $2.8 million through  

SHARE since 1988.

Keppel continued to work with key  

partners in Singapore and overseas  

to organise regular activities for 

beneficiaries. Beneficiaries in Singapore 

include children from Care Corner  

and the Muscular Dystrophy Association 

Singapore, senior citizens from Thye Hua 

Kwan Senior Activity Centres, as well as 

underprivileged households supported 

by North West Community Development 

Council. 

In China, Keppel Land works with  

non-governmental organisations like  

Bless China International and local  

hospitals to provide medical support  

for underprivileged villagers in Yunnan.  

Since 2006, over 100 villagers with  

cataract have had their eyesight restored 

under this programme. Volunteers also 

regularly visit remote villages to donate 

essential supplies.

We strongly support 

the advancement of the 

arts and believe that an 

appreciation of the arts 

should be cultivated from  

a young age. 

To mark World Health Day, BrasFELS 

organised free health checks and lectures  

for over 100 members of the community  

in Angra dos Reis. 

Keppel’s shipyards in the Philippines also 

organise regular blood donation campaigns. 

In 2017, Keppel Batangas Shipyard and 

Keppel Subic Shipyard received a Scroll of 

Honour and a Certificate of Appreciation 

from the Philippine Red Cross’ National 

Office respectively, in recognition of the 

companies’ support and promotion of  

blood donation.

Running for a Cause 

Keppel employees frequently rally to 

participate in charity sports events in aid  

of worthy causes. 

Keppel contributed $30,000 to the Singapore  

Exchange Bull Charge Run 2017, which raised 

money for five charities in Singapore, namely 

AWWA, Autism Association (Singapore), 

Community Chest, Fei Yue Community 

Services and Shared Services for Charities. 

Over 100 employees from across the Group 

joined the run. 

Keppel Land was title sponsor of the 

Singapore leg of the National Geographic 

Earth Day Run, with about 2,200 runners, 

including Keppel Land tenants and staff 

joining the good cause. The event marked 

Singapore’s first mass run powered solely  

by renewable energy and driven by  

zero-waste initiatives. 

Keppel also supported the Heartstrings 

Vertical Marathon, which raised funds 

for Community Chest beneficiaries, and 

Singapore Cancer Society’s Race Against 

Cancer, which saw teams from Keppel 

putting their fitness to the test to raise 

money to fund cancer treatment subsidies, 

cancer rehabilitation, hospice care, cancer 

screenings and public education. 

Spurring Excellence 

Keppel sponsored the Keppel-Singapore 

Table Tennis Association Awards and  

the Keppel-Clementi Zone Training  

Centre in 2017. Since 2013, Keppel has 

provided cash awards to recognise 

national table tennis players with standout 

performances and exemplary character 

traits. The Keppel-Clementi Zone Training 

Centre, which Keppel has supported since 

2011, aims to groom future table tennis 

talents by providing funds for coaching  

and equipment, and to maintain affordable 

training fees.

Keppel Care Foundation 



A Holistic Approach to Giving



Special Focus

Keppel Care Foundation is 

the Group’s philanthropic arm 

which sharpens, coordinates 

and sustains the Group’s 

efforts in corporate giving.

Since its inception in 2012, Keppel Care 

Foundation has disbursed close to  

$30 million in aid of causes that resonate 

with the company’s beliefs and values. 

The Foundation focuses on initiatives 

that protect the environment, promote 

education, arts and culture, or care for  

the underprivileged. In 2017, the Foundation 

disbursed $3.76 million in support of causes 

aligned with these focus areas.

Such initiatives include the Keppel Discovery 

Wetlands, a restored freshwater forest 

wetland at Singapore Botanic Gardens 

which houses a plant collection of over 200 

species, the Keppel Centre for Art Education 

at National Gallery Singapore, which aims to 

foster creativity and a sense of curiosity and 

exploration in children through art, as well  

as endowment scholarships, bursaries  

and awards disbursed through various 

institutes of higher learning.

The Foundation also supports initiatives 

to uplift communities, including North 

West Community Development Council’s 

educational programmes that aim to 

increase the social mobility of students  

from low-income families, as well as  

Monfort Care’s programme to improve  

the nutrition and physical well-being of 

elderly beneficiaries.

Creating Meaningful Impact 

Where possible, the Foundation’s 

contributions are complemented  

by employee volunteerism. 

For example, Keppel Volunteers  

act as ambassadors for the Keppel 

Discovery Wetlands by leading tours 

for students and seniors to promote 

conservation. 

The Foundation also makes financial 

contributions to the National Kidney  

Foundation (NKF) to provide 

underprivileged patients with subsidies 

for their dialysis treatments. To further 

the impact of our contribution, our 

volunteers packed and delivered 

bundles of food and other daily 

necessities to needy patients at the 

various NKF dialysis centres. 

In addition, children with disabilities 

from the Muscular Dystrophy 

Association Singapore (MDAS) benefit 

from regular and meaningful activities 

organised by Keppel Volunteers, which 

are funded by the Foundation.  

This approach to corporate giving is not 

only impactful, but also engages our 

employees, and helps amplify desirable 

outcomes for our beneficiaries.

Keppel Volunteers



Making a Difference



Special Focus

Our community outreach 

initiatives are spearheaded  

by Keppel Volunteers,  

our Group-wide volunteer 

movement.

Keppel Volunteers was started in 2000  

as a ground-up movement by a group  

of employees. The group collaborates 

with numerous charities and voluntary 

welfare organisations on regular activities 

to make a difference to the lives of the 

less privileged. 

In 2017, Keppel Volunteers achieved 

about 12,000 hours of community 

service, a significant increase of 4,000 

hours over the 8,000 hours in 2016.  

Our outreach efforts brought cheer to 

more than 1,000 beneficiaries.

To encourage volunteerism, employees 

are given two days of paid volunteer 

leave annually. Regular volunteers are  

also recognised for their efforts at  

the annual Keppel Volunteers  

appreciation event. 

Keppel Community Month

The Company has designated August 

as Keppel Community Month to rally 

volunteers and spur collaboration  

among business units in driving  

outreach activities. 

In 2017, volunteers in Singapore prepared,  

cooked and distributed food to low-income 

households, conducted workshops 

to impart life skills to underprivileged 

children, and accompanied elderly in a tour 

of the country’s maritime landmarks. 

Keppel Volunteers’ overseas chapters  

in Brazil, China, the Philippines and  

Vietnam also organised diverse and 

meaningful activities, touching the lives  

of communities abroad.

In China, volunteers organised an  

excursion to the beach for disabled 

children. In Brazil, our shipyards nurtured 

the career aspirations of youth through  

its 'Teach-It-Forward' programme.  

In the Philippines, volunteers imparted 

values to young children through folklore 

in a series of story-telling sessions at 

the Keppel-GK Eco Village. Meanwhile, 

employees in Vietnam participated in a 

charity run supported by Keppel Land 

Vietnam to raise funds for underprivileged  

college students. 

Commenting on Keppel Community 

Month 2017, Chief Executive Officer of 

Keppel Corporation, Loh Chin Hua, said, 

“Keppelites stepped forward to make a 

difference during Keppel Community 

Month, serving in diverse outreach 

activities in Singapore and overseas with 

over 1,300 volunteer hours. Through our 

collective strength, lives were touched  

and communities were empowered.”

Fostering Creativity in Children 



Special Focus

Through supporting the arts, 

we aim to foster creativity 

and expression, which in turn 

contribute to the vibrancy of 

our communities. 

The Keppel Centre for Art Education at 

National Gallery Singapore is the first  

art education facility of its kind in the  

region. Established with a $12 million 

commitment from Keppel, the Centre  

has benefitted over 850,000 visitors  

since its launch in 2015. Guided school  

tours and workshops introduce visual  

literacy, analytical and interpretive skills  

to students. The Centre was recently 

refreshed with new exhibits incorporating 

elements that cultivate a sense of curiosity 

and exploration among children.

On 7 June 2017, National Gallery Singapore 

CEO Chong Siak Ching hosted Chairman  

of Keppel Corporation Lee Boon Yang, 

together with members of Keppel’s  

board of directors and senior management,  

to a tour of the refreshed spaces. Also 

present at the event were about 40 children 

from New Life Community Services,  

who were guided by Keppel Volunteers 

through the various exhibits. 

Refreshed Exhibits 

Project Gallery 

‘The Blue Who Swims All This Way’ by 

artist Betty Susiarjo cultivates children’s 

curiosity through imaginative play. Children 

develop tactile and aural sensibilities in an 

‘Underwater World’ as they explore soft 

sculptures and respond to sounds of the 

ocean under an iridescent wave.

Children’s Museum

In the virtual ceramic studio, children 

can learn about how ceramics are created 

as well as design their own virtual ceramic 

pots at interactive stations and observe 

the firing process in a hologram.

Children’s Museum Workshop 

Children enjoy a hands-on experience  

at the workshop, where they are  

introduced to different print-making 

tools, materials and processes and 

have the opportunity to create their 

own artworks inspired by the Gallery’s 

National Collection. 

Art Playscape 

Inspired by urban cities and games 

that children play around the 

neighbourhood, artist Tang Ling Nah’s 

‘Wandering in Black and White’, is 

an immersive installation filled with 

dramatic perspectives and shadows. 

Children learn about form, space and 

light as they engage with shadow play 

and create their own colourful city 

skylines and stories. 

Art Corridor

Children can explore a colourful 

spectrum of shapes, patterns and forms 

inspired by sculptor Han Sai Por’s 

 ‘Tetrahedron-tetrahedron 

Interpenetration’ at the Art Corridor.

Nuturing Communities


Nurturing an Appreciation for the Arts  



Special Focus

Through the extension 

of our Keppel Nights 

programme, we continue to 

nurture an appreciation of 

the arts among students. 

Keppel Corporation has committed 

$500,000 over three years, from 2018-

2020, to Keppel Nights, renewing its 

partnership with Esplanade – Theatres on 

the Bay to nurture a deeper appreciation 

of the arts among students in Singapore. 

Since 2013, the partnership has provided 

about 20,000 students from more than 

70 schools in the heartlands with access 

to arts and cultural shows presented  

by Esplanade. 

Starting in 2018, Keppel Nights will 

expand its scope to include Esplanade’s 

sensory-friendly performances designed 

for audiences with special needs, 

including those on the autism spectrum. 

Aural and visual elements are adjusted 

for such performances, and a calming 

space at the theatre foyer will also be 

made available for children to acclimatise 

themselves before entering the theatre, 

or to take time out during performances.

To mark this renewed partnership, about 

50 students from Jurongville Secondary 

School were treated to the Gala 

Performance of the National Theatre’s 

production of 'The Curious Incident of the 

Dog in the Night-Time' at the Esplanade 

Theatre. Another 15 students from Teck 

Whye Secondary School, together with 

their families and caregivers, attended the  

sensory-friendly performance of the show. 

Yvonne Tham, CEO-designate,  

The Esplanade Co Ltd, said, “As Esplanade 

turned 15 in October 2017, we re-affirmed 

our commitment to serve our diverse 

communities and to do even more to 

be inclusive. With Keppel Corporation’s 

continued support, more students of 

different needs will be able to come to 

their national performing arts centre for 

meaningful arts experiences that we hope 

will inspire them and pique their curiosity 

about the arts and the world.”

Edwin Chan, Principal of Teck Whye 

Secondary School, said, “We appreciate  

that the Keppel Nights programme 

has provided our students with good 

aesthetic learning experiences. Parents 

and their children are also given wonderful 

opportunities to bond when they enjoy such 

performances together.”

Ho Tong Yen, General Manager,  

Group Corporate Communications,  

Keppel Corporation, said, “Keppel Nights 

aims to foster appreciation of the arts 

among students by exposing them to 

world-class performances and diverse 

art and cultural forms. 2018 marks Keppel 

Corporation’s 50th anniversary and we are 

pleased to extend this very well-received 

and impactful initiative for the benefit  

of more students, including those with 

special needs.”

Other Information


Introduction

DNV GL, represented by DNV GL Business 

Assurance Singapore Pte. Ltd., has been 

commissioned by the management of 

Keppel Corporation Ltd. (Keppel) to carry out 

an independent assurance engagement, 

Type 2, Moderate level, for the non-financial, 

qualitative and quantitative information 

(sustainability performance) reported in  

the Keppel Corporation Sustainability  

Report 2017 (the Report), which is available 

to stakeholders from Keppel’s website  

and in print, for the financial year ending  

31 December 2017. This assurance 

engagement was planned and carried out 

using DNV GL’s assurance methodology 

VeriSustain™ (Version 5.0) 1 which is  

based on our professional experience, 

international assurance best practice 

including the International Standard on 

Assurance Engagement 3000 (ISAE3000) 

Revised 2 and the Global Reporting  

Initiative (GRI) Standards. 

Scope of Assurance

The scope of assurance included a review of 

sustainability disclosures and performance 

data from Keppel and its subsidiaries which 

have operations in and outside of Singapore. 

The boundary of the report for identified 

material topics and topic-specific disclosures 

are defined in the respective chapters and 

unless otherwise stated, will include those 

subsidiaries that Keppel has management 

control. We evaluated the Report for 

adherence to the reporting principles for 

defining the sustainability report content 

as set forth in the GRI Standards. We 

understand that the reported financial data 

and information are based on Keppel’s and 

respective subsidiaries’ financial statements, 

which are subject to a separate independent 

audit process. The review of financial data 

taken from the Financial statements is not 

within the scope of our work.

Responsibilities

Keppel has sole responsibility for the 

integrity of the report and the responsibility 

includes designing, implementing, and 

maintaining internal controls over data 

collection, analysis and aggregation as well 

as preparation and fair presentation of the 

Report, and data that is free from material 

misstatement. In performing our assurance 

work, our responsibility is solely towards 

the management of Keppel in accordance 

with the terms of reference agreed on with 

Keppel. However, our statement represents 

our independent opinion and is intended to 

inform the independent conclusion of our 

verification to Keppel’s stakeholders. DNV GL 

is responsible for planning and performing 

the engagement to obtain limited assurance 

about whether the selected information is 

free from material misstatement and meets 

the disclosure requirements.

Basis of Opinion

We conducted the assurance engagement 

in line with the requirements of the AA1000 

Assurance Standard, Type 2, Moderate 

level of assurance and DNV GL’s assurance 

methodology VeriSustain™. A multi-

disciplinary team of sustainability and 

assurance specialists performed the work 

at Keppel’s corporate headquarters and its 

subsidiary Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation (Keppel T&amp;T) in Singapore 

in March 2018 to verify the qualitative and 

quantitative disclosures, including testing 

the reliability of data and the robustness of 

the data aggregation process, such as the 

related management approach for identified 

material topics. As part of the verification, 

we planned and performed our work based 

on DNV GL’s risk-based approach to obtain 

the evidence that we considered necessary 

to provide a basis for our assurance opinion. 

Within the framework of our assessment, 

we performed the following procedures and 

other activities including:

• Conducted interview with data owners 

from Keppel Corporation and its 

subsidiaries including Keppel Offshore  

&amp; Marine, Keppel Land and Keppel T&amp;T,  

to understand the key processes 

and controls for reporting subsidiary 

performance data;

• Assessed the robustness of the 

underlying data and information  

flow and controls;  

• Performed data analysis using a  

risk-based approach and materiality;

• Challenged the sustainability-related 

disclosures, statements and claims;

• Performed limited testing on a sampling 

basis of the selected information at 

Keppel’s corporate headquarters and 

subsidiaries’ headquarters to check that 

the selected environmental and social 

data had been properly measured, 

gathered, recorded, collated  

and reported.

We also performed the following activities to 

assess the adherence to reporting principles:

• Interviewed senior managers and 

representatives responsible for 

sustainability management and 

made enquiries to determine their 

understanding of stakeholder 

engagement and materiality; 

• Reviewed the current sustainability  

issues that could affect Keppel and  

could be of interest to stakeholders.

Independent Assurance Statement

Conclusion

Based on the work undertaken, we 

provide a limited/moderate level of 

assurance over non-financial disclosures 

presented in Keppel’s Report, and 

based on the scope of this assurance 

engagement and in doing so, nothing has 

come to our attention to suggest that the 

Report does not give a fair representation 

of Keppel’s related sustainability 

performance. Without affecting our 

assurance opinion, we also provide the 

following observations regarding the 

adherence to the reporting principles for 

defining the sustainability report content 

and for defining report quality as defined 

in the GRI Standards. 

Stakeholder Inclusivity

Keppel has identified six internal and 

external stakeholder groups such as 

customers, employees, governments, 

shareholders, local communities 

and suppliers. Keppel’s stakeholder 

engagement activities occurred at the 

Group and business unit level through 

various platforms. In our opinion, the 

Report could include concerns of other 

stakeholder groups that Keppel engages 

with, both locally and overseas.

Materiality

Keppel established a materiality matrix 

involving external stakeholders at the 

end of 2014 and has revisited its material 

topics through an annual internal 

exercise. In 2017, Keppel reviewed the 

material environmental, social and 

governance issues internally with the 

Group Sustainability Working Committee 

and Steering Committee. The material 

issues were further reviewed by Keppel 

Corporation’s Board of Directors in 2017. 

Keppel could consider engaging external 

stakeholders in subsequent materiality 

assessments and expanding the boundary 

to include coverage on more material 

topics associated with overseas entities.

Responsiveness

The Report provides an overview of the 

Group’s activities; it keeps stakeholders 

informed of corporate decisions in terms 

of achievements and performance in 

relation to the sustainability material 

arguments. Keppel’s stakeholder 

dialogues and materiality review were 

used to determine the type of information 

that is material to stakeholders.

Completeness

The Report has adequately covered the 

sustainability strategy, management 

approach and sustainability performances 

against the material topics identified. 

The boundary of the Report covers the 

sustainability performances from the global 

operations, subsidiaries and associated 

companies over which the Keppel Group 

has management control. The presentation 

within the Report enables stakeholders 

to analyse changes in the sustainability 

performance over time.

Accuracy &amp; Reliability

Keppel has selected, compiled and reported 

information in a relatively consistent manner. 

Data inconsistencies identified during the 

verification process were corrected prior 

to the Report being published. DNV GL 

concludes that the level at which the Report 

adheres to the principle of accuracy, and the 

reliability of the information on sustainability 

performance can be enhanced by internal 

verification checks to improve consistency  

in data collection.

Report Quality: Balance &amp; Neutrality 

The document allows the reader to examine 

both the positive and the negative trends of 

Keppel’s performance in 2017, presenting a 

balanced account of the activities and results 

relevant to the reporting year, which is 

consistent with the corporate strategies. We 

consider the Report to be a fair description 

of Keppel’s sustainability impact. 

Findings in Relation to  

Specific Sustainability  

Performance Information

The Report covers global operations and 

key subsidiaries and associated companies 

for which Keppel has management control, 

unless otherwise indicated. The reporting 

of the sustainability performance presented 

in the Report is collected centrally by 

a dedicated function in the Group and 

consolidated for reporting. Keppel uses a 

system called CR360 to gather sustainability 

performance data globally. The data 

used for the Report this year is based on 

a combination of manual collection and 

collated information from CR360. The Report 

presents Keppel’s non-financial performance 

in the wide context of sustainability and 

explains how various initiatives from 

Keppel and its subsidiaries are aligned with 

achieving the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals.

requirements. We have complied with 

the DNV GL Code of Conduct 3 during the 

assurance engagement, and maintain 

independence where required by relevant 

ethical requirements. This engagement work 

was carried out by an independent team 

of sustainability assurance professionals. 

DNV GL was not involved in the preparation 

of any statements or data included in the 

Report except for this Assurance Statement. 

DNV GL maintains complete impartiality 

toward stakeholders interviewed during the 

assurance process. DNV GL did not provide 

any services to Keppel during 2017 that 

could compromise the independence or 

impartiality of our work.

Limitation

Our assurance relies on the premise that the 

data and information provided by Keppel 

to us as part of our review procedures have 

been provided in good faith and free from 

misstatements. Because of the selected 

nature (sampling) and other inherent 

limitations of both procedures and systems 

of internal control, there remains the 

unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities, 

possibly significant, may not have been 

detected. The engagement excludes the 

sustainability management, performance 

and reporting practices of Keppel’s 

associated companies, suppliers, contractors 

and any third-parties mentioned in the 

Report. The company's position statements, 

statements for the management approach, 

and case studies and examples are 

excluded from the scope of our work. We 

did not interview external stakeholders as 

part of this assurance engagement. The 

reported disclosures related to Economic 

performance are based on financial 

disclosures and data, which were cross-

checked with internal documents and the 

audited consolidated financial statements. 

Limited depth of evidence gathering 

including inquiry and analytical procedures 

and limited sampling at lower levels in 

the organisation were applied as per the 

agreed scope of engagement. The data for 

Environmental and Social performance are 

verified with random samples of data, and 

the aggregated data at the corporate level 

is used for the verification. The procedures 

performed in a limited/moderate level 

of assurance engagement vary in nature 

and timing, and are less in extent than 

for a reasonable/high level of assurance 

engagement. We expressly disclaim any 

liability or co-responsibility for any decision a 

person or an entity may make based on this 

Assurance Statement. 

Statement of Competence  

&amp; Independence 

DNV GL applies its own management 

standards and compliance policies for 

quality control, in accordance with  

ISO/IEC 17021:2011 - Conformity Assessment 

Requirements for bodies providing 

audit and certification of management 

systems, and accordingly maintains a 

comprehensive system of quality control 

including documented policies and 

procedures regarding compliance with 

ethical requirements, professional standards 

and applicable legal and regulatory
