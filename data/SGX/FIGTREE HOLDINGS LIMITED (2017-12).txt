MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD 

 

 

Danny Siaw – Executive Chairman and Managing Director 

 

With increased expectations and emphasises on sustainable global economy, our 

Board believes that sustainability reporting practices can help to drive progress by 

all organisations towards a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. 

 

Our Board has taken into consideration material sustainability issues and identified 

various material ESG factors such as economic, environmental, social and 

governance. As part of our strategy formulation, the Board are constantly involves 

in overseeing and monitoring of these factors. With the aim to create long lasting 

value for all our stakeholders, sustainability is an integral part of our Company’s 

strategy.    

  

Our company will gradually place emphasis on sustainability and would implement 

appropriate policies and programmes when the opportunities arise. In addition, the 

Company has ongoing efforts to achieve and meet best practices set by industry 

standards from projects, in particular to environmental and workplace safety 

standards; this has been affirmed by the receipt of several accreditations and awards, 

such as BCA Green Mark Award and bizSAFE Star for FY2017.

ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE

areas include design and build, project and construction management consulting 

services, property development and property investment.

Supply Chain Management 

We maintain a policy of subcontracting to those parties best satisfying a range of 

criteria appropriate to the particular project. Amongst others, price competiveness 

and quality shall be the major factors when considering to award works to sub-

contractors.  

 

We have ISO procedures on Purchase Control and Vendors Assessment in place which 

provides guidelines along the procurement process such as vendor sourcing and 

selection, purchase order preparation, review and approval and vendor assessment.  

 

Generally, we do not enter into any long term agreements or arrangements with any 

one of our sub-contractors as this would provide us with the flexibility to evaluate 

and select more sub-contractors who are able to provide higher quality work at 

competitive prices. Nonetheless, to ensure sustainable provision of services from our 

sub-contractors, we actively engage our major sub-contractors to identify and 

evaluate areas for improvement during the course of and at the end of the project.  

 

External Initiatives 

The Group is committed to giving back to the community and also encourages active 

participation by its employees to make a difference to the community. During the 

reporting period, we have made donation to Care Community Ltd – the voluntary 

welfare organisation that aims to provide the best welfare assistance to the elderly, 

handicapped and less fortunate in Singapore.

Economic Performance 

 

Economic performance is very important to stakeholders particularly to investors as 

economic performance provides them with a return on their investment. In addition, 

other stakeholders such as employees are also deemed to benefit from such 

performance. Thus, economic performance has been ranked as one of the material 

topics for stakeholders.  

 

In order to generate tangible value for our stakeholders, the Group has strived to 

maintain healthy profits for the Group.

disciplined investment and project selection approach.

Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery 

There is no confirmed incident of corruption and bribery during the reporting period. 

Values are strictly enforced to our employees to ensure that our stand on corruption 

and bribery is clear. Several policies are in place and communicated to the employee 

to emphasise anti-corruption and anti-bribery value within the Company, as follows: 

Code of Conduct  

The code of conduct is stipulated under the Employee’s Handbook. Employees’ 

conduct during day-to-day operations will be monitored by their respective superiors 

or heads of department. Employees are subject to disciplinary actions in the event 

of breach of code of conduct.   

Conflict of Interest 

Under the Employee’s Handbook, the Group established a clause in relation to 

conflicts of interest. All employees are to make yearly and/or at any appropriate 

time, a declaration to the Group on their interest (either directly or indirectly) with 

any of the sub-contractors, suppliers, customers, vendors or any other interested 

parties to the Group. In addition, employees who are involved in key business 

functions such as procurement, are provided with regular anti-corruption training.  

Whistle-blowing Policy  

Our Company has adopted a whistle-blowing policy which is made known to our 

stakeholders. The stakeholders may, in confidence, raise concerns about 

improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters by submitting a 

whistle-blowing report to figtree@nexiats.com.sg or through the hotline at +65 6597 

7293.  

Subsequent Reporting for FY 2018 

We hope to maintain our zero record in corruption cases, continue to enhance our 

governing policies and cultivate an anti-corruption and anti-bribery environment and 

training for our employees.

Environmental Compliance 

 

We do our part to protect the environment by complying with environmental laws 

and regulations, which contributes towards a cleaner, greener and healthier 

environment. We strive to introduce and promote environmental-friendly solutions 

to our customers. To name a few, properties under our portfolio are designed with 

extensive green features through passive and active strategies with holistic 

approach, provision of energy efficient Variant Refrigerant Flow air-conditioning 

system, energy efficient LED lights and lighting system. 

As a testament of our commitment on this, our Group has received several awards 

and certifications as highlighted below. It is important that the Group consistently 

operate in a sustainable manner in line with our role in the environment. There was 

no reported incidents of non-compliance to environmental laws and regulations in 

the reporting period. 

Although not mandatory, the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme (“GGBS”) program 

spearheaded by Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) and Green Mark was 

adopted by Figtree Group and its subsidiary, Figtree Projects Pte Ltd (“Figtree 

Projects”). The adoption of this initiative by the Group involves operational 

implementation of industry good practices by Figtree Projects in order to ensure 

that both the Group and Figtree Projects are operating well above mandatory 

environmental compliance. 

Figtree Projects is an ISO 14001 certified entity since 2014 and is currently certified 

as GGBS Merit-Contractor as well. With concern for our environment and taking 

product life cycle analysis into consideration, we have adopted the BCA’s Green 

Mark Scheme as an initiative to shape a more environmental friendly and sustainable 

built environment. Below are the awarded projects undertaken by Figtree Projects: 

1.  BCA Green Mark Award (Gold Plus) - Second Development Pte Ltd for 

Menlo Logistic Hub: 2013 

2.  BCA Green Mark Award (Gold Plus) - Tech-Link Storage Engineering Pte 

Ltd for KWE Singapore Logistics Centre: 2014 

3.  BCA Green Mark Award 2015 (Platinum) - Figtree Projects Pte Ltd Head 

Office (Office Interior - Version 1.1): 2015 

4. BCA Green Mark Award 2015 (Platinum) - Development 8 Pte Ltd for LF 

Logistics Centre: 2015 

Subsequent Reporting for FY 2018 

We will continue to play a vital part in compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations in the countries which our major operations are in.

remained disciplined in executing our growth strategies, we strive to play our part 

in social contribution in terms of employment.  

We provide full-time employment to more than 20 individuals from diverse 

backgrounds. We adopt fair hiring practice and provide wider benefits to our full
