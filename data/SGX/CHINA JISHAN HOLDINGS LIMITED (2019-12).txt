Annual Safety Training Session 

The theoretical knowledge of first aid 

was introduced on site, and the first aid 

demonstration 

was 

carried 

out 

by 

professionals. 





The Group has always adhered to the policy of "safety first, focusing on prevention, and taking 

comprehensive governance", and strictly abides by the laws and regulations such as the People's 

Republic of China Work Safety Law and Interim Provisions on the Investigation and Treatment of 

Hidden Hazards in Work Safety Accidents of the People's Republic of China. 

 

Employees are the most valuable asset of the Group. Therefore, we attach great importance to the 

safety management of employees and have been committed to increasing the Group's emphasis on 

safety. Abiding by the guiding policy of "Safety First", the Group has been improving its occupational 

health and safety systems and policies, and providing protective measures (including the 

requirement on wearing workshop uniforms) for its employees to prevent any potential risk of health 

and safety. 

 

The lessees are required to pay great attention to labor security and we have organized various 

training sessions related to safety management all year round to strengthen employees' safety 

awareness through continuous training. The training sessions are a combination of theoretical and 

practical training, including safety training, fire protection training, fire drill, expert first aid speech, 

and machine operation training. In 2019, 1,230 people has attended the training sessions. 

Safety Training Sessions 

In 2019, many safety training sessions were organized, including the annual safety training session, 

safety alert education training course and fire first aid training course. 

In April 2019, the Group organized the annual 

safety, emergency and ambulance training 

courses and required all employees to attend 

the sessions.

Fire Drill 





In May 2019, a fire-first-aid training was 

organized. Experts from the fire department 

were invited to demonstrate how to operate 

fire equipment and how to perform fire 

rescue. The training taught our staff how to 

respond quickly to situations and how to 

protect themselves from fire accidents. 









Experts from the fire department also demonstrated the correct way of using the fire 

extinguisher and how to put out a fire using a hydraulic-sprayer, which is essential for 

processing workshop employees because the fabrics are made of flammable materials. 







Thereafter, the employees proceeded 

to have their practical sessions. 

Security Emergency Drill  

In order to prevent sudden accidents such as fires and explosions, and minimize casualties and 

economic losses, the Group and its lessees formulate comprehensive and various emergency 

plans, and carry out multiple emergency drills and training activities such as flood control drills, 

fire emergency evacuation drills, etc. We also examine the staff's ability to handle emergencies, 

improve the Group's emergency management level, and review the emergency plans for any 

deficiencies.

Environmental Pressure 

Textiles are a fundamental part of everyday life and an important sector in the global economy. In 

terms of value, the global market size of the textile staples market is expected to expand from 

approximately US$125 billion in 2017 to over US$200 billion by 2027, and to register a compound 

annual growth rate of 4.9% during the forecast period 2017-2027. As printing and dyeing is a 

crucial processing stage in the textiles industry, it will also be in an upward trend in the long run. 

 

However, with the development of the industry, the environmental pressure that the world bears 

continues to increase. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ("IPCC") estimates 

that global emissions will increase from the current 2% to 3% by 2050. IPCC also estimates that 

global temperatures will rise by 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, if no action is taken to reduce 

emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Although only responsible for a 

comparatively small percentage of global emissions, the print and dye industry is making efforts to 

reduce its carbon footprint.

Sustainability Policy 

The Group strictly abides by the relevant laws and 

regulations such as the Environmental Protection Law of 

the People's Republic of China, Energy Conservation Law 

of the People's Republic of China, Law of the People's 

Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of 

Environmental Pollution by Solid Wastes and other laws 

and regulations. 

 We have achieved initial results through controlling environmental risks, strengthening on-site 

pollution prevention, carrying out the verification of carbon asset inventory, continuing the use of 

clean energy, and adopting the sustainable development strategy of "ecological civilization 

construction" and "being green and low-carbon". We ensure that our business operations, as well 

as those of our lessees, are carried out in a responsible manner and we do our best to minimize 

any negative impact relating to carbon emissions, waste and the consumption of energy and 

resources.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 | CHINA JISHAN HOLDINGS LIMITED 

Energy Use and Consumption 

The principal sources of energy used by the lessees' 

business operations are electricity, water and steam. 

Electricity is used to power the machines in the 

workshops, which is essential for business operations. 

Water consumption is used to print and dye the fabrics. 

After processing, water effluent is discharged to 

wastewater treatment plants for further treatment. 





The following table illustrates the energy utilization from different energy sources in 2018 and 

2019. Due to a 1.18% increase of production from 228.89 million meters in 2018 to 231.58 million 

meters in 2019 by the lessees, electricity utilization increased by 0.62% ; but due to the company’s 

improved production process and greatly increased resource utilization efficiency, water 

consumption, steam consumption decreased by 5.14% and by 5.00%, sewage disposal 

decreased by 6.80%.

The steam is used for processing fabrics. Two types of steams are used in the factory: low- 

pressure steam for fabric treatment; and middle-pressure steam for heat setting. Currently, energy 

is mainly utilized by lessees in the factories and the Group is responsible for supervising and 

regulating their operations and production, including energy utilization.

Electricity Consumption 

Due to the increased textile production by lessees in 2019, electricity consumption increased by 0.31 

million kWh compared with 2018, and energy intensity decreased by 0.55%, which is basically the 

same as in 2018. At the same time, the Group has also taken actions to improve operational 

efficiency: 

1、Introducing new and efficient equipment and disposing old facilities; 

2、 Adding operational efficiency as a key indicator in the employees' performance review program; 

3、Changing the reporting mechanism from “staff reporting to workshop supervisors” to “staff 

reporting directly to department head”; 

4、Increasing the frequency of self-assessment in the workshop from monthly to weekly . 

 

In the construction of the new factory, energy-efficient facilities were introduced to reduce carbon 

emissions. These include energy-saving electric appliances, LED lights and thermal insulation 

windows and walls.

Water Consumption（10,000t） 



Sewage treatment（10,000t） 

Total water consumption and sewage treatment volume: 

The constitution of the sewage and its treatment are illustrated in the next two pages. In 2018 

sewage disposal was approximately 12.22% higher than the volume of water consumption, as 

chemical additives in the print and dye processing are mainly fluids. The dyeing effluent would be 

discharged with the water consumed during the processing. In 2019, sewage disposal was 

approximately 10.26% higher than the volume of water consumption . The sharp decrease of water 

consumption in unit sewage disposal in 2019 was led by improvements in processing efficiency that 

required less water to produce the same amount of fabric. 

Sewage Disposal 

Wastewater from dyeing processes is one of the biggest contributors to textile effluent. The 

wastewater mainly includes residual dyes and auxiliary chemicals.  

Water Consumption and Sewage Disposal 

Comparing with 2018, water consumption in 2019 

decreased by 5.14%. The main reason for the reduction 

is that the Group has improved production processes 

and environmental protection measures. Recycling water 

resources in the production process has greatly 

increased the efficiency of water resources utilization. In 

2018, the lessees built a wastewater pool in the factory. 

The wastewater pool has been used consistently until 

now. Comparing with 2018, the wastewater treatment 

efficiency is high, and water consumption in unit sewage 

disposal decreased.

The Main Components of Wastewater: 

Improvement of Textile Auxiliaries 

to Protect Environment 

With the development of technology, the textile 

industry is taking on the responsibility of 

protecting the environment. Print and dye 

processing industry now uses environmentally 

friendly textile auxiliaries instead of chemical 

auxiliaries, our lessees use environmentally 

friendly 

textile 

auxiliaries, 

which 

are 

environmentally friendly and in compliance 

with European standards, thus contributing to 

less pollution from the effluent discharged  

from our factory.

• Pre-treatment inside the 

mills 

3 

• Wastewater treatment 

uniformly in Binhai District 

Wastewater Management 

Apart from using environmentally friendly textile auxiliaries, in 2018, the lessee built a waste pool 

for pre-treatment before discharging wastewater to the wastewater treatment plant. The pre- 

treatment capacity of the waste pool is 2,500 tons/day. The construction of the waste pool reduced 

the sewage discharge from the factory to a certain extent. 

 

The factory was relocated to Binhai District, Shaoxing City at the end of 2016 and this district is 

equipped with one of the largest wastewater treatment facilities, with an average flow rate of 

900,000 cubic meters per day (m³/day). Wastewater discharged from different mills in Binhai

Steam Consumption 

Comparing with 2018, the steam consumption in 2019 decreased by 5%. Due to the Group's 

improved production process, the resource utilization efficiency has been greatly increased, so that 

the kinetic energy consumed when producing the same amount of textiles is reduced, which in turn 

leads to the reduction of steam consumption and the improvement of the steam utilization rate. 

Currently, lessees use two types of steam in factories: low-pressure steam for fabric treatment and 

medium-pressure steam for heat setting. Lessees are attempting to adapt new technology in the 

future for fabrics processing to improve production efficiency and reduce steam consumption.

Employee Care 

Total Workforce by Function : 

The Group has always adhered to the "people-oriented" 

concept to protect employees' rights, interests, health and 

safety. As a leading player in China’s textile industry, China 

Jishan remains committed to enhancing the productivity and 

manufacturing capabilities of its core print and dye business. 

In line with this internal strategy, we are determined to 

recruit professional and dynamic individuals from diverse 

backgrounds. During the year of 2019, the Group has rented 

out all the factory plants and equipment to ensure a stable 

and recurring income stream. The Group is responsible for 

the human resources of the employees which include those 

subcontracted to the lessees. 





Our workforce can be divided into two main functions: factory workers (subcontracted workers for 

lessees) and non-factory staff. Factory workers are employees working for lessees in the factories. 

Non-factory staff are employees working for China Jishan who are in charge of all operational work, 

including the management team, as well as the financial department, administrative department and 

synthesis department. The Group is in charge of the human resources procedures for all employees 

(both factory and non-factory workers). In 2019, factory workers made up 96.25%（1,259） of the 

total workforce due to the labour intensive characteristic of the print and dye industry. In 2018, 

factory workers made up 96.26%（1,285）of the total workforce. The proportion of factory 

employees remained stable.

department, and the office) and the lessees. The unit's sewage volume, COD concentration and 

other sewage indicators, water, electricity, steam and other flow data are measured, air quality and 

other waste management and equipment are supervised, and the lessees shall strictly collect the 

waste hazards generated during the production process according to government requirements, 

supervise the on-site management system, and find that whether there is a phenomenon that does 

not meet the requirements of the government for on-site management. Manufacturing processes 

shall be in line with the requirements of customers and locations of operations.
