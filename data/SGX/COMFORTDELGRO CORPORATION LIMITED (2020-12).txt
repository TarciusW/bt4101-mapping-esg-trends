SUSTAINABILITY REPORT


We are pleased to share with you our latest Sustainability 

Report. This Sustainability Report articulates ComfortDelGro’s 

sustainability ambition across all our operations around 

the world. It underscores our commitment to keep our 

Stakeholders abreast of our efforts and performance across 

the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) domains. 

ESG issues are complex but increasingly critical, both to our 

long-term value as a Company and to the wider society. This is 

especially so for us as a global mobility service provider. 

We play a key role in contributing to sustainable development 

through connecting societies with mobility services, including 

our extensive public transport networks. We welcome the 

opportunity to share this progress with you in our sixth 

Sustainability Report. This Report has been prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) 

Standards: Core option and SGX Listing Rule 711 (A) and (B).

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

2020


2020 is a tumultuous year. From the first 

reported infection in the Chinese city 

of Wuhan, the coronavirus (COVID-19) 

outbreak soon spread to become a 

global pandemic, upending economies, 

businesses and livelihoods. As a global 

land mobility operator, the ComfortDelGro 

Group is badly affected. 

The reach and impact of the global 

COVID-19 pandemic necessitates that the 

Group strengthen its focus on the social 

dimension of our sustainability effort. 

Our key priority is to ensure the health 

and safety of our staff, commuters and 

stakeholders, and to minimise exposure 

of COVID-19 risks on public transport. 

Where necessary, financial support is 

also extended to our business partners, 

including granting of rental reliefs to our 

cabbies over the COVID-19 period. We 

understand the criticality to save lives, 

protect livelihoods and to keep trust with 

our stakeholders over this difficult period. 

Although vaccines are now available, the 

recovery from this COVID-19 crisis will 

be long and uncertain. The global crisis 

has exposed inadequacies, risks and 

inequalities in the management of the 

environment and across communities.  

As an enterprise that believes in  

long-term value creation, the Group will 

continue to commit ourselves to the 

Environmental, Social and Governance 

(ESG) targets, and further our investments 

in sustainability to create long-term 

growth for the Group. The Board will 

continue to provide oversight, with the 

support of Management, to accelerate our 

ESG investments and efforts. We are all 

responsible to build back better in a post 

COVID-19 world.

To accelerate Singapore’s efforts against 

climate change, Ms Grace Fu, Minister 

for Sustainability and the Environment 

of Singapore, has recently announced 

the launch of a multi-ministry Singapore

Green Plan 2030. The ComfortDelGro 

Group is keeping up to-date with the 

Green Plan and will align with the 

targets to advance the whole-of-nation 

sustainability agenda. We are mindful of 

the carbon emissions from our business 

operations and have first set our 2030 

ESG targets in 2019. We will review 

these targets as the Government firms 

up concrete plans to push forward the 

sustainability agenda.

ENABLING AN ENERGY EFFICIENT  

TRANSPORT SYSTEM 

As a global land transport operator, the 

ComfortDelGro Group is committed to 

minimise the environmental impact of our 

operations. The Group has committed to 

halve our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission 

intensity by 2030. Despite having some 

of our plans derailed by the COVID-19 

pandemic, we remain cautiously optimistic 

that we will meet the target. To-date, over 

50% of our Singapore taxi fleet is petrol-

electric hybrid vehicles. In the People’s 

Republic of China where we operate 

taxis in nine cities, all new vehicles have 

to be electric vehicles. To-date we have 

4,083 CNG and electric vehicles out 

of our combined fleet of 10,345 taxis. 

In Melbourne, Australia, we have taken 

delivery of 40 out of 50 petrol-electric 

buses financed under a green loan, 

making CDC Victoria the largest hybrid 

bus operator in the city. 

SBS Transit, our public transport operator 

in Singapore, pro-actively partners the 

Land Transport Authority to experiment 

and learn about the operations and 

maintenance of green vehicles. It has 

since taken delivery of 20 electric buses 

for trials along two bus routes. In London, 

our Metroline business continued its 

efforts to progressively replace its fleet 

with electric buses. Today, Metroline 

operates a fleet of 90 double deck electric 

buses on two routes.

The Group is also committed to improving 

the reliability and efficiency of our public 

transport services. In 2020, the Mean 

Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) of our 

North East Line and Downtown Line were 

2.04 million train-km and 2.09 million 

train-km respectively. The improved 

reliability will help in steering commuters 

towards using public transport that 

consumes less energy per passenger km 

compared to private vehicles. 

In 2020, the Group Sustainability Office 

also participated in the Assessing  

Low-Carbon Transition (ACT) for 

Transportation study initiated by the 

Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a leading 

global disclosure provider of ESG ratings 

to investors. Based on our preliminary 

projects and plans, the findings concluded 

that our Group is on the right path to 

transit to a low-carbon fleet.

Several projects have been delayed 

because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

These include the hydrogen bus trial in 

London, as well as the plan to install an 

additional 2MWP of solar photovoltaic (PV) 

panels at our Downtown Line Gali Batu 

Depot. We are working closely with the 

stakeholders to ensure the resumption of 

these projects in 2021.

ENHANCING THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF THE 

COMMUNITY AND OUR PEOPLE

Our Group’s focus on safety is not only 

embedded in our policies, procedures 

and trainings, but also reflected by our 

response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

From the onset of the outbreak, the Group 

and its businesses are able to rapidly 

step up their business continuity plans 

and to introduce various safe distancing 

measures. Cleaning regimes were 

enhanced at all premises and vehicles to 

minimise the risk of the virus spread and 

to ensure the health and safety of our 

commuters and staff. We also distributed

2020


masks, sanitisers and disinfectants to our 

staff and cabbies. Group Procurement 

worked tirelessly to ensure our stockpile 

of essentials remain healthy. At the 

peak of the pandemic, supplies had to 

be coordinated across geographies to 

mitigate shortages. The Group continued 

its public transport operations to 

provide services to frontline healthcare 

workers and ensure the continuity of 

essential services. We have implemented 

telecommuting to allow our staff to work 

from home where possible, thereby 

minimising the risk of infection spread. To 

allay our staff’s anxieties over this period, 

online wellness workshops are regularly 

held to provide advice on physical and 

mental well-being. 

 

Being acutely aware of the impact of 

the circuit breaker and lockdowns to the 

livelihoods of our cabbies, the Group also 

took the unprecedented decision to waive 

the rental of our taxis over the lockdown 

periods in 2020. Beyond rental waivers, 

we partnered various food and beverages 

entities to provide delivery services via the 

newly developed ComfortDelivery App, 

to supplement our cabbies’ income over 

the circuit breaker period. The Group’s 

Board and Senior Management also took 

a voluntary cut in Directors’ fees and pay 

respectively, to demonstrate solidarity with 

Singaporeans and our business partners 

over this difficult period. 

Beyond the pandemic, the Group 

continues to invest and explore safety 

initiatives and technology. The predictive 

anti-collision system introduced  

by ComfortDelGro Bus is a success,  

and plans are underway to procure  

more of such systems. In 2020, passenger 

injury across the Group has decreased 

and there were zero road fatalities. 

As a responsible mobility operator, 

ComfortDelGro will continue to prioritise 

road and passenger safety.

In 2020, the Group continued to give 

back to our communities, including 

the poor, the elderly and the sick. We 

donated over S$1.44 million to various 

charities and welfare organisations. In 

light of the pandemic, we have also 

mobilised additional resources to help the 

community. Moove Media, our advertising 

arm, sponsored the acrylic face shields at 

several food courts to allow diners to eat-

in safely. To enable disadvantaged families 

that may not be well-equipped for home-

based learning during the lockdown, 

Moove Media upcycled cardboards into 70 

tables and donated them to the homes of 

these students.

During the year, CabbyCare, our Taxi 

Business’ cabby volunteer group in 

Singapore, made over 1,015 free trips to 

deliver meals and library books to the 

needy. In recognition of ComfortDelGro 

Taxi’s significant contributions in 

improving workers’ lives and livelihoods, 

it was awarded the National Trade Union 

Congress (NTUC) May Day award in 2020.

ENGRAINING A CULTURE OF INNOVATION AND 

STRONG GOVERNANCE

In 2020, all three listed companies in 

the ComfortDelGro Group emerged 

top 20 in the Singapore Governance 

and Transparency Index (SGTI). This is a 

significant milestone for the Group, and 

we will remain committed to fostering a 

culture of strong governance. 

We continue to invest in innovation 

and digitalisation. A Group Chief Digital 

Officer has been brought in to accelerate 

our digital transformation. At the Board

level, a Digital Committee was set up to 

provide guidance and oversight to our 

digital effort. Across our businesses, a 

global digital challenge was initiated in 

2020 to source for solutions to improve 

business operations and to identify new 

opportunities. We were encouraged by the 

submissions and the ideas. 

In the wake of the pandemic where 

working from home became a norm, 

we have strengthened our cybersecurity 

measures, and mandated cybersecurity 

trainings for all staff. We are glad that 

there have been no major cybersecurity or 

personal data breaches across the Group. 

CONTINUING OUR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY

As climate change issues become more 

pertinent, there is an urgent need for 

collective efforts from everyone. The 

Group has set our sustainability targets, 

and has put in-place plans for a greener 

fleet transition. But we will need to do 

more. We are happy to announce that 

beyond reporting and compliance, the 

Group has decided to commit to the 

Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi), 

an international project to limit global 

warming to less than 2°C of pre-industrial 

level. ComfortDelGro will be the first 

mobility operator in this region to take 

up this challenge. It will entail developing 

our transition plans and having the plans 

approved over the next 24 months. This 

will involve the Group committing to 

the use of clean energy, to building a 

sustainable enterprise and to playing our 

part to combat climate change. 

We are thankful that our efforts in 

sustainability has been recognised when 

ComfortDelGro was selected as one of 

five Singapore companies to be included 

in the 2020 Dow Jones Sustainability 

Index (DJSI) – Asia Pacific. This is the 

second year that the Group has been 

included in this prestigious index. We 

also maintained our rating in the top 

fifth percentile of the Sustainalytics ESG 

assessment in 2020.

We thank our Staff, Partners and 

Stakeholders for their support in our 

sustainability journey during this difficult 

year. There is a lot more to do, and we 

look forward to your continuing support 

and partnership.

have expected the magnitude and 

disruption that would result from the 

pandemic.

As a global mobility service provider, we move and 

connect people, create jobs, invest and innovate  

to remain relevant and improve the quality of life. Our 

sustainability approach is focussed on minimising our 

environmental footprint, ensuring road, passenger and 

workplace safety, and enhancing the well-being of our 

people and the community.

ComfortDelGro is committed to 

safeguarding the interests of our 

Stakeholders for sustainable growth, at the 

highest governance level. Sustainability 

is a key pillar of the Group’s overall 

strategy and one that the Board pays close 

attention to. In particular, we consider 

Environmental, Social and Governance 

(ESG) issues as part of our strategic 

formulation. Our global sustainability 

strategy focusses on three key areas: 

enabling an energy efficient transport 

system, enhancing the safety and well-

being of the community and our people, 

and engraining a culture of innovation and 

strong governance.

Being in the mobility business, we are 

cognisant that the delivery of our services 

has a direct impact on the environment. 

To this end, we will continue to work 

closely with the Regulators, the vehicle 

manufacturers and our suppliers to 

reduce our overall carbon footprint. We 

are encouraged by the advancement 

of technology and are keeping close 

tabs on developments in the field of 

Green technology. We are already 

operating hybrid buses and taxis, and 

have been working with manufacturers 

and Regulators on electric vehicle (EV) 

trials. We believe that technological 

advancements will have a significant 

impact on the way we operate and our 

environmental footprint.

Our people, and the people we serve, is 

another area of focus. From the health 

and safety of our employees to the 

BOARD STATEMENT

support for the socially disadvantaged, we 

are constantly looking at ways to improve. 

Our employees are committed to projects 

and activities that contribute to society 

and help protect the environment. ESG 

matters as determined by our Stakeholders 

and deemed to be material to value 

creation are integrated into our balanced 

scorecard, which is used to set objectives, 

drive behaviours, measure performance 

and determine remuneration. The Board 

reviews and approves these material issues 

and has tasked the Senior Management 

team with the management and 

monitoring of these issues.

Corporate governance is also something 

that the Board watches closely. As 

a company that conducts business 

on a global scale, we are committed 

to nurturing a corporate culture that 

encourages employees to act ethically 

and with a strong sense of mission in 

meeting the needs of customers and to 

ensuring transparent management and fair 

decision-making.

In this regard, the adoption of the 

corporate auditor system has helped us 

increase the effectiveness of the auditing 

and monitoring functions fulfilled by 

Auditors. We enhanced the management 

oversight function of the Board of 

Directors by implementing appropriate 

measures such as reviewing the terms 

of reference of all Board Committees 

and building Board competence through 

relevant trainings and workshops.

on our commitments as presented in this framework.

ComfortDelGro‘s framework consists of three key pillars: 

• 

Enabling an Energy Efficient Transport System, 

• 

Enhancing the Safety and Well-Being of the Community and Our People, and

The materiality process guides ComfortDelGro in focussing on the 

most important issues for long-term value creation. This report details 

topics which have been deemed as material to ComfortDelGro’s 

businesses and key Stakeholders, based on the economic, 

environmental and social impact caused by our business activities.

MATERIALITY

We started our sustainability reporting journey in 2015 with an in-depth materiality assessment. The assessment 

was based on international best practice, integrating the principles of Stakeholder Inclusivity and Sustainability 

Context. This would enable us to focus on matters that impact business growth and are of importance to our 

Stakeholders, in the wider context of sustainability.

IDENTIFICATION &amp; 

PRIORITISATION

VALIDATION

REVIEW

Using the 

internationally accepted 

AccountAbility 5-Part 

Materiality Test 

model, as part of the 

AA1000 Standard, we 

considered regulatory 

and non-regulatory 

norms, stakeholder 

behaviour and 

concerns, our core 

business policies and 

values, short-term 

financial impacts and 

business peer-based 

norms to identify issues 

that are most relevant 

to ComfortDelGro.

A validation process 

was conducted by 

ComfortDelGro’s 

Senior Management 

and based on 

feedback from External 

Stakeholders. The 

final list of issues 

that are deemed as 

material to us are 

the issues that have 

significant economic, 

environmental, and 

social impacts, or could 

substantively influence 

the assessments 

and decisions of our 

Stakeholders.

In 2020, we reviewed 

the issues internally 

and have deemed that 

they remain relevant 

to our business and 

Stakeholders. The 

table below shows 

our material issues 

of high and medium 

priority levels. We 

intend to conduct an 

in-depth review of our 

material issues in 2021, 

to consider the latest 

risks and opportunities 

especially in a post-

COVID-19 world.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

Led by our Chairman Mr Lim Jit Poh, 

the Board of Directors champions and 

provides oversight on ComfortDelGro’s 

sustainability effort. ESG matters are 

deliberated by the Board of Directors 

every half-yearly at the tabling of the six-

monthly progress report.

The Sustainability Steering Committee, 

chaired by our MD/Group CEO  

Mr Yang Ban Seng, and comprising key 

members of the Senior Management, 

reviews ComfortDelGro’s sustainability 

performance and reports performance 

against targets to the Board. The Steering 

Committee plays a key role in driving 

the Group’s sustainability ambitions, 

spearheaded by our Group Chief Risk &amp; 

Sustainability Officer Mr Jackson Chia, 

who is assisted by the ESG Working 

Groups. Each working group convenes 

bi-monthly to review the progress and 

discuss how the Group and its Business 

Units can better implement initiatives and 

contribute to the ESG efforts.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK

As part of our wider governance 

framework, we aligned our governance 

policies and practices with the principles 

and guidelines set out in the Code of 

Corporate Governance issued by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore on  

6 August 2018.

We also have in place a robust Enterprise 

Risk Management Risk Framework which 

enables our Group and Business Units to 

understand the nature and complexity 

of the risks involved in the operations 

and provides a systematic process to 

identify and review the risks and prioritise 

resources to manage them.

We work closely with our suppliers to maintain high standards of 

operation. We uphold fairness and respect in our relationships 

with our suppliers, pay our bills on time, and are transparent in all 

contracts and negotiations.

MANAGING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

Working with our suppliers to  

tide through COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the 

ComfortDelGro Group played an essential 

role to direct the flow of Personal Protective 

Equipment (PPE) (items such as surgical masks/

gloves /gowns/hand santisers/disinfectant 

wipes) across its global network of business units. 

China is the first country to be hard hit by the pandemic in 

February 2020, which was coincidentally the Chinese New Year 

period. Holiday closure of factories, coupled with lockdowns 

across the country caused a dire shortage of PPEs. Our public 

transport businesses in China needed essential PPEs urgently 

to protect our public-facing staff. ComfortDelGro worked 

swiftly to consolidate and airfreight masks, surgical gloves and 

thermometers to China. 

During the onset of the pandemic, ComfortDelGro sourced for 

PPE items from all parts of the world, as the world’s factory – 

China was halting exports. We had our supply chains stretching to 

countries such as Saudi Arabia, India and Bangladesh. Thankfully, 

we also received precious supplies from our Australian office. 

In the latter half of 2020, the pandemic shifted to the rest of the 

world, and our Malaysian, the UK and Australian offices were not 

spared. Fortunately, major PPE producing countries such as China, 

Thailand and Vietnam began to resume the export of PPEs. As 

such, ComfortDelGro Singapore was able to procure and airfreight 

them to our overseas counterparts. 

This pandemic not only tested the resiliency of our supply chains;  

it also deepened the bonds between our global offices. As the 

Chinese saying goes, “患难见真情  - A friend in need is a friend 

indeed “, we are heartened to have global counterparts to rely on 

in times of need. Everyone was ready to “雪中送炭  -  offer help 

to each other in times of need”.

PURCHASES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS 

The bulk of our purchases consists of 

energy and direct material &amp; services for 

the operation and maintenance of our 

fleets. In 2020, we purchased over 500 

hybrid taxis and fully-electric taxis. About 

90% of our spend is with 47 suppliers, 

of which approximately 51% of them 

have worked with us for more than five 

years. We have long-term contracts of 

three years or more with 235 suppliers. 

About 74% of the contracts by value were 

established through competitive sourcing 

exercises, including 53% through public 

tenders. The rest of the contracts were 

established with suppliers who are sole 

source, or incumbents with whom we 

leveraged existing contract volumes.

SUPPLIER SELECTION 

We select our suppliers using a multi-

criteria weighted matrix, with each 

criterion assigned a weightage according 

to its relative importance. Criteria 

used include the supplier’s technical 

capabilities, service quality, supply 

assurance, environmental responsibility, 

safety records, financial stability and cost 

competitiveness. Suppliers are also made 

aware of our Supplier Ethics Policy in 

every tender document, which outlines 

our expectations on fair practice, ethical 

conduct, social and environmental 

responsibility. We refrain from working 

with suppliers if they cannot comply 

with our Policy, and have implemented 

measures to mitigate supply chain risks in 

the areas of Fraud and Corruption, Supply, 

Legal, Price, Environmental, and Health 

&amp; Safety. Read more about our Supplier 

Ethics Policy in Annex A. 

SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT 

We conduct Supplier Performance 

Management exercises regularly to assess 

our suppliers’ performance against market 

norms and the expectations agreed 

upon in our contracts. Key suppliers are 

appraised on their cost management, 

safety and service standards. These 

contribute to our risk mitigation efforts, 

allowing us to accurately uncover the root 

causes of potential problems and resolve 

them as quickly as possible. Moving 

forward, we plan to further integrate ESG 

criteria into the supplier performance 

scoring system.

As part of our digitalisation efforts, our 

new procurement software, ComPASS 

(ComfortDelGro Procurement, Analytics, 

Sourcing and Supplier) was introduced 

in 2020. As at January 2021, ComPASS 

is actively used by over 93% of Business 

Units in Singapore. The electronic spend 

management system will drive end-to-

end procurement processes, which cover 

supplier onboarding, sourcing, contract 

management, procure-to-pay and spend 

analysis functions. ComPASS will enable 

a more robust supplier governance, 

and will help us work more closely with 

suppliers to improve processes and ensure 

compliance with environmental and safety 

regulations. 

To-date, over 10,000 orders and over 

8,000 invoices have been processed 

electronically, reducing paper wastages 

and saving a total of 1,113kgCO2e.

WHY THIS ISSUE IS 

MATERIAL

ComfortDelGro as one of the largest land 

transport companies in the world with a 

global workforce, a global shareholder 

base and a global outlook, has significant 

economic impacts throughout the 

societies in which we operate across 

our entire value chain. We look beyond 

short-term profits and are focussed on 

generating positive change and value to 

the economy and our Stakeholders for the 

long-term. 

HOW WE MANAGE  

THIS ISSUE

We believe that good corporate 

governance policies and sound risk 

management are key drivers to the 

Group’s long-term economic growth. 

We are also increasingly integrating 

Environmental, Social and Governance 

(ESG) matters in our business decisions, 

and approaching business risks and 

opportunities more innovatively.

GROUP PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

2020 was a challenging year for many. 

ComfortDelGro had demonstrated grit 

in these difficult times with support from 

our staff and business partners. The 

Government has also extended reliefs 

and assistance since the start of the 

pandemic, including the Job Support 

Scheme (JSS) wage subsidy of up to 30% 

for the transport sector and special relief 

fund provided to taxis and private-hire 

vehicles. Although business outlook had 

improved in the fourth quarter, the risk 

environment continued to be fraught with 

uncertainties. In these uncertain times, the 

ComfortDelGro’s revenue was

down 17.2% to S$3.2 billion, registering a

Profit Attributable to Shareholders of 

S$61.8 million and Earnings before 

interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 

(EBITDA) of S$599.2 million. Lower 

contributions from its Singapore business, 

and the waiver of taxi rental pulled the 

Group’s 2020 net earnings 76.7% lower 

to S$61.8 million. Profitability,however, 

remains sound, with EBITDA contributing 

to 18.6% of the Group’s Revenue.

The public transport business segment 

was badly affected by the pandemic, 

recording a 10.8% decrease in full revenue 

in 2020. Taxi business recorded a loss  

of S$64.4 million due to the impact  

from COVID-19 and reduction in its 

operating fleet.

SUPPORTING A 

RESILIENT ECONOMY

ComfortDelGro is guided by the principle of creating long-term 

economic growth without negatively impacting environmental, social 

and safety aspects of the community and our people. We identify 

new opportunities in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 

autonomous driving to transform our mobility system. In 2020, the 

ComfortDelGro Group continued to invest in selective advanced 

technologies to further strengthen its business operations.

ComfortDelGro Taxi Provides Taxi Rental Waiver  

Amounting Close to S$120 million

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, ComfortDelGro Taxi has been extending relief 

package including rental rebates and full rental waivers amounting close to S$120 

million. The first of the relief package was in the form of daily rental relief, that was 

announced in March, aimed at helping cabbies tide through what was expected 

to be a relatively short crisis. As the pandemic continued to last, our cabbies were 

hard-hit and found it difficult to make ends meet. Hence, we took steps to further 

support our cabbies and provide rental waivers, which were extended twice. 

 

The Company also waived the call levy imposed on booking jobs and the taxi rentals of cabbies who were 

placed on medical leave, stay home notice or under quarantine by the Ministry of Health and extended 

assistance where needed, including financial aid from its Cabby Hardship Fund. To-date, nearly S$1 million 

has been given out to assist them.



Times like these, we have to band together and face the 

challenges together.

the pandemic forced business transformation, climate change will 

accelerate business models that can reduce emissions drastically 

and urgently. Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets 

will drive the greening of our fleet, improvements in energy efficiency 

and the use of renewables.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY 

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

Despite the unprecedented fall in 

transport and movement in 2020, it 

remains to be seen how this will impact 

transport behaviour going forward and 

hence the emissions arising from it. As of 

2019, the transport sector is the fastest-

growing contributor to climate emissions, 

accounting for nearly one-third of the 

world’s energy demand and more than 

20% of its carbon emissions globally.

Operating in seven countries with fleets 

of buses, taxis and rail, we recognise our 

influence and ability to make a difference 

in transport emissions. By maximising 

fuel efficiency and investing in innovative 

solutions, ComfortDelGro is able to 

reduce GHG emissions, provide cleaner 

transportation and therefore mitigate 

climate change. The efficiency of our fleet 

allows us to move people longer, further, 

and faster with less resources. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

One of the key thrusts of our strategy to 

improve efficiency and reduce emissions 

is to green our fleet. Since the early days, 

ComfortDelGro has been among the 

first adopters of policies and innovation 

in deploying suitable vehicles for service 

to improve energy efficiency. We have 

started phasing out our diesel fleet 

globally and converted our fleets to hybrid 

or electric vehicles (EVs).

For our existing diesel fleet, we ensure 

that they meet the latest standards (Euro 

5 or higher), which produces lower 

levels of harmful exhaust emissions such 

as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, 

hydrocarbons and particulate matter.  

By reducing these pollutants, we can  

also improve fuel economy and reduce 

carbon emissions.

We also work hand in hand with our 

vehicle manufacturers and fuel suppliers, 

providing them with valuable feedback 

about the engineering performance of 

prototype vehicles and fuel technologies.

ComfortDelGro commits to a long-term 

approach in transforming and innovating 

our operations for a more sustainable 

future. This year, due to the restrictions 

brought about by the pandemic, some 

of our plans to improve energy efficiency 

The transport industry is fast trending 

towards cleaner, less polluting vehicles. In 

Singapore, we expect to phase out diesel 

in our taxi operations by 2023. With 5,389 

hybrid vehicles and four EVs, 57.1% of our 

taxi fleet in Singapore is now hybrid or 

electric. We aim to continue increasing the

We have also been working to increase the 

number of green buses on the roads. SBS 

Transit, our listed subsidiary and a major 

public bus operator in Singapore, has 3,531 

buses in its fleet as of end-2020. SBS Transit, 

together with the Land Transport Authority 

(LTA), newly introduced 20 electric buses on 

trial in 2020. As at the end-2020, SBS Transit 

operates 25 Volvo diesel hybrid buses 

(DHBs) which were previously procured by 

the Land Transport Authority (LTA). These 

DHBs have low emission levels and have 

also reduced operations and maintenance 

costs. As at end-2020, 80% of the its fleet 

are Euro 5-compliant or better.

We continue to support EVs with our 

Direct Current (DC) fast charging station, 

operated by ComfortDelGro Engineering. 

Since 2019, ComfortDelGro Taxi has been 

expanding trials for EV taxis with Hyundai 

long-range Kona taxis. To support this, the 

DC fast charging station in Braddell was 

made available 24 hours a day to cabbies 

trialling the new taxis. The Hyundai Kona 

electric taxi has twice the power of the 

battery power of the fully-electric Hyundai 

Ioniq, which is part of the Group’s ongoing 

trial. With DC charging, the Hyundai Kona 

electric taxi charges up in just over an hour 

and can travel up to 350km when fully 

charged. It is also equipped with active 

safety driving assistance technologies such 

as Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic 

Collision Warning, as well as a regenerative 

braking system. We are encouraged by the 

outcome of the trials and will progressively 

refresh our fleet with EV taxis.

In Australia, we built on our successes in 

2019 by introducing more hybrid buses in 

Melbourne. In 2018, the Group’s Australian 

subsidiary secured an A$25 million (S$23.1 

million) green loan from OCBC Bank to 

finance its hybrid bus fleet in Victoria. The 

loan was structured according to the green 

loan principles issued in 2018 by the Loan 

Market Association and Asia Pacific Loan 

Market Association. We have since taken 

delivery of 40 out of the 50 planned hybrid 

buses in 2020. We expect the last batch of 

buses to be delivered in mid-2022. 

In the United Kingdom (UK), Metroline 

is keeping in line with its philosophy to 

maintain a young and environmentally 

friendly fleet. Hybrid and electric buses 

make up 54% of Metroline’s 1,502 fleet of 

buses. In 2020, Metroline introduced an 

additional three Optare Metrodecker electric 

buses. In ensuring that diesel buses in the

efforts to ensure that our entire Metroline 

bus fleet is Euro 6 emissions standard 

compliant, a further 71 vehicles were 

converted to be Euro 6-compliant in 2020. 

With that, 87% of our Metroline fleet is Euro

EFFICIENCY ACROSS OUR OPERATIONS 

Beyond increasing the share of greener 

vehicles in our fleet, we also constantly find 

improved ways to manage our energy in 

other aspects of our operations. As the bulk 

of our electricity consumption comes from 

our train operations, depots and workshops, 

we focussed on implementing various 

improvements and technologies in  

these areas. 

Energy-efficient designs in our stations 

include:

• 

energy-saving escalators that reduce 

speed when they are not in use

• 

energy-efficient LEDs and fluorescent 

lighting

• 

carbon dioxide sensors in AC system to 

regulate outdoor air supply to reduce 

energy consumption while ensuring 

good indoor air quality

• 

natural lighting at entrances

• 

regenerative brakes that reduce wear 

and tear on mechanical brakes and 

store kinetic energy, saving SBS Transit 

enough energy to power an equivalent 

of 370 Housing &amp; Development Board 

(HDB) five-room flats a year

ENABLING AN ENERGY EFFICIENT 

TRANSPORT SYSTEM

Changes in driving behaviour can also 

improve fuel efficiency, which not only 

reduces pollution but is also cost saving.  

We regularly train our drivers to adopt 

driving patterns that can reduce the  

average fuel consumption by as much 

as 15% a year, which in turn cuts carbon 

dioxide emissions by more than half a 

tonne. These include proper acceleration 

and braking techniques, as well as other less 

pollutive driving habits such as switching 

the engine off when stationary, filling 

up to three-quarter of the fuel tank and 

decluttering the vehicle to lighten the load.

Since 2019, we expanded our driver 

training from the UK and Australia to also 

cover Singapore. As such, SBS Transit’s bus 

captains have now received annual training 

on how to drive efficiently.

ASSESSING LOW-CARBON TRANSITION 

INITIATIVE (ACT)

In 2020, the Group Sustainability Office 

participated in the Assessing Low-Carbon 

Transition (ACT) for Transportation study 

initiated by the Carbon Disclosure Project 

(CDP), a leading global disclosure provider 

of ESG ratings to investors. The study 

helped CDP develop a methodology 

that will recognise companies in the 

transportation sector that have set 

ambitious climate commitments and 

have taken steps to transit to a low-

carbon economy. We are pleased that 

the preliminary findings from the study 

concluded that ComfortDelGro is on the 

right path to transit to a low-carbon fleet.

In Singapore, we continuously renovate 

our facilities and buildings to improve their 

energy efficiency based on the Building 

Construction Authority’s (BCA) Green Mark 

guidelines. Our Singapore Head Office 

was retrofitted in 2019 with a more energy 

efficient air-conditioning system, which 

saved up to 20% of electricity annually. 

We have also fitted LED lightings for 90% 

of our Head Office. About 50% of our 

buildings in Singapore will be Green Mark/

Eco Office certified by 2023, and 100%  

by 2030.

We will continue to implement grid-connected solar PV solutions for our facilities, including 

additional panels at the SBS Transit DTL depots, VICOM and some of our engineering 

workshops.

We have also developed an Energy Policy

WASTE MANAGEMENT

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

Living on a finite planet, it is crucial that 

humanity manages resources in ways that 

generate as minimal waste as possible, in 

order to ensure human and environmental 

health and preserve precious resources. 

In the countries we operate, managing 

resources and waste have become 

clear Government priorities. To tackle 

an increasingly urgent waste issue 

and prevent Singapore’s only landfill 

from being depleted, the Singapore 

Government launched a Zero-Waste 

Masterplan in 2019. Similarly, the 

Australian Government updated its 

National Waste Policy in 2018, while in the 

UK, the Government overhauled its waste 

system with a new Resources and Waste 

Strategy in 2018.

ComfortDelGro recognises the 

importance of waste management 

and responsible consumption, which 

have various economic, social and 

environmental impacts in the areas we 

operate in. In line with various national 

agendas on waste, we developed waste 

management plans at our various 

locations of operation. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

The bulk of the Group’s waste comes from 

day-to-day operations as well as waste 

from commuters, which are generally 

removed by authorised contractors to 

be incinerated or disposed of at landfills. 

We recycle operational waste such as 

batteries, engine oil, tyres, metals, drums 

and cartons. ComfortDelGro strives to 

reduce waste generated, increase reuse 

and recycling of materials and ensure 

responsible waste disposal at all our 

locations of operation in order to protect 

the local people and environment. We 

comply with all waste-related regulations 

in our locations of operation. 

DECOMMISSIONED VEHICLES

Decommissioned vehicles are sent to 

scrap yards or contractors where valuable 

materials are recovered and recycled. 

ComfortDelGro’s hazardous wastes, 

typically generated from the repair and 

maintenance of vehicles, are responsibly 

disposed of by specialist contractors. 

In line with Section 30A of Singapore’s 

Environmental Public Health Act, the 

ComfortDelGro Head Office has begun 

reporting waste data to the National 

Environment Agency (NEA) in 2020, and 

will continue to do so going forward.

To encourage employees to recycle, 

recycling bins for plastic, paper, and cans 

are placed in our offices and recycling 

days are organised regularly. We also 

participate in Singtel’s electronic waste 

(e-waste) recycling programme, ReCYCLE. 

To-date, we have deployed the e-waste 

bins at six of our premises. We also recycle 

our bulky e-waste with a licensed NEA 

recycling contractor.

In our Singapore bus depots, our 

technicians use tablets instead of paper 

checklists and forms when carrying 

out maintenance works. Using the Bus 

Mobile Maintenance System (BMMS), 

they can obtain work instructions, 

drawings, electrical schematics and 

parts information to carry out their work. 

They are also able to access the bus 

manufacturers’ portal to obtain more 

detailed bus maintenance information 

from their e-manuals. The use of the 

BMMS not only improves efficiency and 

storage, but also reduces paper usage.

A Second Life for our  

Decommissioned Vehicles

BUSES

SBS Transit will be donating decommissioned buses to the Ang Mo Kio-

Thye Hua Kwan Hospital and ASPN Chaoyang School, so that their patients 

and students can practice travelling on buses independently. However, 

discussions on this matter have been put on hold due to COVID-19. 

Currently, we are working with Tan Tock Seng Hospital on donating a decommissioned bus for use 

in physiotherapy to prepare patients in performing their daily tasks.

TAXIS

From 1999 to-date, 27 Crown and Sonata taxis, at a combined value of over S$90,000, have been 

decommissioned and gifted to hospitals and schools for rehabilitation and education purposes. 

The last Hyundai Sonata taxi was donated to Tan Tock Seng Hospital in December 2019. Future 

decommissioned taxis will be the Hyundai i40s.

In 2020, ComfortDelGro Taxi prepared three decommissioned 

taxis for Singhealth Community Group. The first 

decommissioned Hyundai i40s have been transferred to 

Sengkang General Hospital in July 2020 and the second was 

gifted to Outram Community Hospital in January 2021.

WATER CONSUMPTION

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

We recognise that water scarcity around 

the world has been exacerbated by 

climate change. As such, efficient water 

consumption is crucial in ensuring 

operational efficiency and mitigating 

water security risks. Some of the countries 

that the Group operates in face water 

stress, and hence managing our water use 

efficiently is a concern for the Group and 

our stakeholders. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

The bulk of our water consumption is due 

to the washing of vehicles.

In 2019, the Group began to use reclaimed 

NEWater for non-potable water uses 

such as bus washing and the irrigation of 

rooftop garden at Ulu Pandan Bus Depot. 

These efforts can lead to significant 

potable water savings of 9,000 cubic 

metres a year, equivalent to 3.6 Olympic-

sized swimming pools.

In our office buildings, water is mainly 

used in pantries and toilets. Business Units 

that achieved the Eco-Office Plus awards 

have also educated their staff on water 

conservation measures. Since 2019, all 

of the water fittings in our Head Office 

were replaced to adhere to Public Utilities 

Board’s Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme 

(WELS). In 2020, our Braddell premises 

was awarded the Water Efficient Building 

(WEB) Basic Certification. We intend to 

certify our other business units as well. 

At VICOM, SETSCO’s Construction 

Technology Division began a water 

recycling initiative in 2019 where recycled 

water is used to cure concrete cubes  

before they are tested for compressive 

strength. This initiative helps save up to 

2,160 cubic metres of water a year, which 

is nearly the volume of an Olympic-sized 

swimming pool.

In 2020, our water withdrawal decreased, 

partially due to a reduction in business 

activities as a result of COVID-19. We 

will look into implementing more water 

efficiency measures to reduce our water 

withdrawal in future.

ENHANCING THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING  

OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR PEOPLE



2020 has shown the world, more than ever before, 

that the integrity of the economy rests on the 

resilience and wellbeing of people. Operating in 

seven countries with over 23,700 employees and 

serving millions of commuters daily, ComfortDelGro 

has responsibility over lives and livelihoods. Despite 

challenges over the year, we remain ever committed 

to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of those who 

serve us, and those we serve.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

2020


With over 40,000 vehicles plying the roads in seven countries, road 

safety has always been a core component of our operations. 

However, this year, our operations faced new challenges brought 

about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the circumstances, a 

significant proportion of our staff and drivers were still working 

to keep people moving, and many essential workers continued to 

commute with us. Beyond regular safety measures, we took extra 

care to ensure that employees and commuters were kept safe and 

healthy in the new normal.

SAFETY IS OUR PRIORITY

TARGET

2020 PERFORMANCE

Zero Fatalities

• 

Zero road fatalities 

• 

Zero workplace fatalities

Injury rates below national averages in 

our locations of operations

• Kept injury rates below  

national averages

Progress against targets:

1 Our safety systems comply with regulations in the jurisdictions that we operate in. They include Acts relating to workplace health and safety 

and passenger transport.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

A good safety record is required to 

maintain commuter trust. It is our 

responsibility to ensure safe journeys for 

all commuters, regardless of whether they 

are riding with us or are fellow road users. 

The pandemic has enabled us to rethink 

how we manage health &amp; safety. Due 

to our reach, it is important we remain 

committed to keeping our community 

safe and doing our part in fighting 

COVID-19.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

Our occupational health and safety (OHS) 

systems are established in line regulatory 

requirements1 and internationally 

recognised standards, such as ISO 14001, 

ISO 45001, ISO 9001, ISO 4801 and AS/

NZ4801. Our OHS management system 

covers all employees, as well as all 

vendors, contractors and operators that 

operate within our premises.  

Third parties are made aware of the 

prevailing safety measures prior to 

commencement of work, through means 

such as the Contractor Induction Package 

in CDC Victoria.

As a transport provider, it is crucial 

that we adequately identify hazards 

and robustly assess risks to ensure the 

safety of our employees, workers and 

customers. In Singapore, we do this 

through internal yearly risk assessments as 

well as independent physical inspections 

and observations. In Australia, hazard 

and risk identification and assessments 

are conducted as per ISO 14001, 

45001, 9001 and 4801 standards. They 

detail the processes and procedures 

for risk identification, assessment and 

management in the workplace. In our UK 

operations, risk assessments and a Safe 

System of Work (SSOW) are in place and 

are reviewed when an incident occurs to 

ensure all risks are documented.

We have also invested heavily in training 

and re-training courses, and ran safety 

awareness and training programmes 

to instil a safety and security conscious 

culture in employees at all levels. WSH 

Committee members have to attend 

ENHANCING THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING  

OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR PEOPLE

PG

COMFORTDELGRO

CORPORATION LIMITED


more training sessions to ensure that they 

are able to adequately and appropriately 

carry out their duties. Our operations 

staff, including SBS Transit’s bus and rail 

engineering staff and VICOM’s staff, are 

trained and qualified by accredited training 

agencies to perform their various jobs in 

accordance with stipulated regulations. 

When required, SETSCO’s staff will 

also attend safety orientation and site 

familiarisation courses organised by clients 

in the construction, shipyard, marine and 

oil/petrochemical sectors. 

As we have stringent and robust OHS 

management systems for our workplaces, 

we also extend similar expectations to 

our business partners. Due diligence is 

carried out across our global operations 

to ensure that third party business 

partners have the necessary licenses and 

documentation. For example, a Method 

Statement and Risk Assessment is a 

pre-requisite for all ComfortDelGro Taxi 

vendors. This is reviewed internally by 

our Safety Officer and requires approval 

prior to any commencement of work. In 

Australia, in addition to these processes, 

all vendors will have to complete and 

online induction program to ensure that 

they fully understand and comply with 

ComfortDelGro’s OHS expectations. 

WORKPLACE HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

Our joint management–worker Workplace 

Safety &amp; Health (WSH) Committees (details 

in Annex B) represent all our employees 

and workers in our countries of 

operation, to evaluate occupational safety 

programmes. A strong emphasis is placed 

on safety through training, education 

and engendering a strong safety culture. 

Aside from day-to-day monitoring of 

OHS matters, WSH Committees meet on 

a routine basis (i.e., monthly, quarterly, 

annually) to conduct evaluations and 

assessment of OHS management systems, 

and to develop appropriate solutions. 

Employees are encouraged to report 

any work-related hazards, without 

fear of reprisals. ComfortDelGro has 

systems in place to foster a supportive 

environment to reporting unsafe work 

circumstances. In Australia, employees 

can report incidents via their workplace 

kiosk or via the Company mobile app on 

personal devices. Alternatively, employees 

can also raise incidents or hazards to 

their supervisor and/or WSH committee 

representatives. There are whistleblowing 

policies in place to ensure that no adverse 

action is taken against these employees. 

All employees have the right to remove 

themselves from dangerous situations or 

unsafe work circumstances. In Australia, 

national legislation stipulates workers’ 

rights to cease or direct cessation of 

unsafe work, if the worker has reasonable 

concern that continuing work would 

lead to significant exposure to health 

and safety risks. Trained employee 

Health and Safety Representatives have 

the authority to issue stop work notices 

in unsafe situations. This will ensure 

corrective action is implemented before 

work recommences. In Singapore, VICOM 

Inspectors can report such matters to their 

respective Chief Inspector or the member 

of the WSH committee. 

Across the ComfortDelGro Group, 

reported work-related breaches of safety 

are investigated and subsequent corrective 

actions taken to eliminate or minimise the 

hazard, avoiding recurrence. Investigation 

and analysis of OHS incidents are used 

to ascertain whether there are systemic 

issues that require additional training, 

change of procedures or acquisition 

of additional equipment that reduces 

the risk of injury. Where appropriate, a 

review is conducted to identify similar 

exposure in other business units, and a 

safety alert communicated. Incidents and 

investigations of breaches in workplace 

safety are reported to the business units’ 

respective management. 

Our business units have in place services 

and facilities to support occupational 

health. In Singapore for example, we 

provide annual and routine health

screening and ensure the availability 

of first aid kits and Automated External 

Defibrillator (AEDs). Our safety systems 

and stringent checks ensure that health 

and safety is held to the highest standards. 

Safety requirements are incorporated in 

tender documents for relevant products 

and services. 

In 2020, much of our focus for workplace 

safety has been on keeping our employees 

guarded against COVID-19 infections. 

Adhering to various government directives 

and internal safety guidelines, we have 

also put in place several safety measures 

and Business Community Management 

(BCM) policies across all our Business 

Units. This included telecommuting, split-

team arrangements, and limitations on 

group sizes. Employees also undertake 

daily health screening including 

temperature checks to prevent them 

entering the workplace if they  

are unwell.

Beyond OHS, we believe in promoting the 

health and wellbeing of our workforce. 

Health-related activities during 2020 

were focused heavily around COVID-19 

infection prevention activities, such as 

hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, 

donning and doffing personal protection 

equipment (PPE), cleaning and 

disinfection, and waste removal. Videos 

and training packages were developed 

to support these activities. We kept up 

to date with the latest advisory and best 

practice as the situation evolved, and 

provided employees with regular bulletins 

were communicated via email. Posters 

and noticeboards are placed around the 

workplace to promote engagement and 

compliance to OHS requirements. 

Although it is challenging to organise 

group activities for employees during the 

pandemic, ComfortDelGro continues 

to provide employee health benefits 

such as discounted gym memberships. 

Supporting our employees’ mental 

health and wellness is also important 

to ComfortDelGro. For example, in 

Australia, our Business Units have an 

Employee Assistance Program (EAP) in 

place whereby staff have access to a 

limited number of free and confidential 

counselling with qualified professionals. 

The EAP program can be used for any 

work or non-work-related matters that 

may be impacting health and wellbeing. 

The program is also open to family 

members. Such mental health support 

is particularly helpful throughout the 

pandemic, in a time of heightened anxiety.

GROUP PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The Group recorded zero workplace 

fatalities in Singapore, Australia and the 

UK. Workplace Injury Rate (WIR) for 

Singapore and UK/Ireland falls below the 

Workplace Safety and Health Report 2019 

national statistics published by Ministry of 

Manpower. The 2019 national statistics 

for workplace injury rate for Logistics &amp; 

Transport industry is 821.2 per 100,000 

employed persons. Australia’s benefit 

systems and “no-fault” system of workers’ 

compensation for work-related injuries 

indirectly led to relatively high number of 

workplace injury reports and long medical 

leaves. There have been no incidents 

of non-compliance with regulation and 

voluntary codes concerning the health &amp; 

safety impacts of products and services 

during their life cycle.

ENHANCING THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING  

OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR PEOPLE

ROAD &amp; PASSENGER SAFETY

In Singapore, we have been implementing 

the iSafe system since 2019, which 

comprises the Safe Green Eco System, 

GoldenEye, and MobilEye. The entire 

SBS Transit fleet has been installed with 

the MobilEye, a smart camera that is 

able to detect, analyse and monitor road 

conditions while the vehicle is moving, 

as well as provide real-time audio-visual 

warning via a display unit to the driver.

Newer buses provisioned by the Land 

Transport Authority (LTA) have been 

installed with the Integrated Smart 

Advance Warning Unit (I-SAW-U) instead 

of the MobilEye. Similarly, I-SAW-U is 

a smart camera system that acts as an 

extra pair of eyes to warn Bus Captains 

of obstructions and subjects in their blind 

spots. It also alerts the Bus Captains if a 

pedestrian is in front of the bus, if the bus 

strays off lane, or if it is travelling too close 

to the vehicle in front.

We also made investments in artificial 

intelligence technology. In December 

2019, we launched Singapore’s first fully-

predictive anti-collision buses, which 

come with a Driver Support System 

that has a built-in Collision Warning &amp; 

Emergency Brake (CWEB) feature.

With the system’s ability to initiate braking 

if the driver does not respond to the 

warnings in time, Volvo’s CWEB feature is 

a welcome safety enhancement that  

helps bus drivers avoid critical situations 

and accidents. There are plans to purchase 

more of such buses over the next two 

years. ComfortDelGro Bus Drivers  

have undergone training on the in-built 

CWEB feature.

To protect passengers and employees, 

almost all of our buses, trains and train 

stations in operation across the Singapore, 

the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia 

are installed with CCTVs or in-vehicle 

cameras. 

In 2020, SBS Transit relaunched the 

escalator safety campaign at MRT stations 

to advise elderly commuters on the safe 

use of escalators to reduce the incidence 

of falls. For bus safety, its plans to roll 

out a campaign was suspended due to 

the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, 

educational posters have been put up 

at the bus interchanges. The campaign, 

when launched, will include roadshows 

at interchanges as well as safety 

ambassadors on board buses and at bus 

stops to advise elderly commuters on safe 

practices, specifically holding on  

to support, staying on the lower deck  

and staying seated until the bus stops  

for alighting.

COMFORTDELGRO

CORPORATION LIMITED


We experienced a general reduction in 

fatalities and injuries from 2020, due to 

reduced business operations as a result 

of the pandemic. In Singapore, Australia 

and the UK, accidents resulting in 694 

injury cases were recorded, 515 of which 

were from SBS Transit. This translated into 

3.12 passenger injuries per one million 

kilometres travelled in Singapore, which 

was lower than 2019. No passenger fatality 

was reported for 2020.

In terms of vehicle collisions, we averaged

0.36 collisions for every one million

kilometres with a total of 394 collisions

in Singapore, out of which 220 were from

SBS Transit. The number of collisions in 

Singapore were much lower than 2019 

but the drastic drop in kilometres travelled 

during the COVID-19 period contributed 

to the increase in the Vehicle Collisions 

Rate.

In the UK and Australia, there

were 179 recorded injury cases in our

scheduled bus business during the year,

translating into 1.45 passenger injuries

per one million kilometres travelled,

which was lower than 2019. In terms of

vehicle collisions in the UK and Australia,

we averaged 32.5 collisions for every one

million kilometres with a total of 4,010

collisions, which was much lower as

compared to 2019.

Braving the COVID-19 with  

Our Employees and Cabbies

As one of the world’s largest and most prominent transport provider, many of our 

employees and drivers were working within the community throughout the year to 

keep essential functions moving. We ensured that we took extra care to limit our 

employees’ and drivers’ COVID-19 exposure while at work, in order to safeguard 

their health and safety. 

Despite our best efforts, some of our employees and cabbies contracted 

COVID-19. We recorded 12 tragic fatalities in our UK operations3. In Singapore, two out of eight infected 

cabbies have passed on. 

As at 31 December 2020, there were 22 COVID-19 cases across SBS Transit, VICOM and ComfortDelGro 

Bus employees, 32 cases4 amongst our UK employees, and 13 cases5 amongst our Australian employees. 

As for China, Vietnam and Malaysia, there were no reported infections of any staff or cabbies.

While it may be that our employees contracted the virus outside of work, it is in our interest to actively 

monitor and respond to incidents of COVID-19 cases amongst our employees in order to prevent the 

further spread of the virus.

For our management and operations staff, we enacted a business continuity plan ahead of and in 

anticipation of major closures and lockdowns in Match 2020. Across our operations, we implemented 

remote work and safe work management measures. Throughout the year, we adhered to the changing 

and most updated government workplace guidelines and restrictions.



3 Figures as at 31 December 2020. 

4 Figures from 1 Aug 2020 to 31 December 2020. In the UK, testing capability was severely limited during the early part of the pandemic and 

there were no credible figures for the level of infection amongst staff.

5 Of the 13 cases, seven were from our bus operations and six were drivers from the Non-Emergency Patient Transport ambulance service.

COVID-19 Safety Measures

In order to keep the public and our 

employees safe, we implemented various 

social distancing, sanitation and safety 

measures throughout 2020. Despite the 

fall in ridership, ComfortDelGro continued to service 

a significant section of society and it was vital that we 

do our part in curbing the spread of the virus. 

At the onset of the pandemic, we stepped up  

cleaning and safety measures across all 

ComfortDelGro vehicles and facilities.  

We strengthened sanitisation measures, regularly 

disinfected high touchpoints and distributed 

cleaning kits to our drivers and employees. We 

also implemented measures such as temperature 

screening, collection of contact details to facilitate 

contact tracing and daily temperature checks. 

We comply with all local government regulations and 

recommendations for safe management. For example, 

in Singapore, passengers have been encouraged to 

use the SafeEntry QR Code system to check in when 

they board our taxis and to check out when they 

disembark.

OUR VEHICLES

Swan Taxis has introduced Western Australia’s first 

sanitisation stations for taxis in Perth – in an effort to 

reduce the risk of contamination from COVID-19 and 

to ensure ongoing public confidence in the safety of 

taxis. The service includes a deep clean of the interiors 

of the taxis using the high-grade disinfectant, as well 

as customer touchpoints such as the door handles. We 

also introduced support measures to assist its drivers 

through the current COVID-19 events.

To minimise driver-

passenger contact and curb 

the spread of COVID-19, 

we installed plastic shields 

in 400 ComfortDelGro 

taxis. Called V-shield, these 

protective shields are locally-

manufactured and have 

been trademarked by Moove 

Media. Measuring 1m x 0.7m 

x 0.6m, the V-shield covers 

the driver’s cabin entirely, 

and has two “window” 

openings for passengers to 

make payment.

Similarly at ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, 

163 training cars were installed with “Instructor 

Coaching Shields” in order to create a safe and 

conducive environment for both instructors and 

learners. Additionally, CDC driving instructors 

were required to wear masks, put on goggles 

and keep windows down during the lessons.

Cabbies in Singapore were engaged to ferry 

suspected COVID-19 patients as well as incoming 

travellers who may be potential COVID-19 

cases. These shields act as an additional layer 

of protection for our cabbies, providing them a 

peace of mind as they work.

to support the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore 

in transporting non-emergency patients to hospitals, 

such as those on stay-home-notice and returnees to 

Singapore. Their vehicles were reserved for MOH’s 

use and dispatched by call centre operators and were 

unavailable for public booking.

Through the Sayang Sayang Fund (a Community Impact 

Fund started by the Community Foundation of Singapore) 

S$110,000 worth of taxi vouchers went towards 

healthcare workers and vulnerable communities such as 

isolated seniors and low-income families impacted by the 

COVID-19 pandemic. On top of that, ComfortDelGro Taxi 

committed S$80,000 worth of promo codes to the public 

healthcare sector to defray taxi fares for their healthcare 

workers. 

As a token of appreciation to our frontline heroes, 

Moove Media delivered Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream to 

staff at the National University Health System (NUHS) 

to thank them for their courage and hard work as 

Singapore battles COVID-19.

Australia experienced an onslaught of challenges from the 

bushfires at the end of 2019, and subsequently was impacted by 

the COVID-19 pandemic in March. In light of this, the CDC We 

Care Fund was transitioned to fund any assistance and recovery 

measures in challenging situations such as pandemic crisis or 

any disasters faced by our broader communities, especially in 

areas previously affected by the bushfires. 

In the early days of the pandemic, face masks were in short 

supply. We utilised the CDC We Care Fund to secure and 

distribute face masks to communities in regional NSW and 

Melbourne. In total, we donated over 60,000 face masks.

The British Chamber of Commerce recognised NAT Group 

as a “UK Business Hero” for going the extra mile to support 

local communities and essential workers during the outbreak 

in Wales. NAT Group was one of the pioneers in adopting 

safe management measures, such as rigorous cleaning, social 

distancing and cashless payments. Throughout the lockdown, 

buses continued to provide transport to key and essential 

workers. NAT transported a total of 6,200 National Health 

Service (NHS) staff free of charge. Bus routes were modified 

to ensure that essential travel was uninterrupted, and a 24/7 

emergency contact system was set up to ensure that they could 

be reached in the event of any sudden requirement. 

Nina Slevin, Director of Partnerships for South and Mid Wales 

Chambers of Commerce, said: “We are so proud to recognise 

Business Heroes across Wales. Throughout the pandemic, NAT 

Group has illustrated the agility and flexibility of the business, 

reacting swiftly to passenger needs and Welsh Government 

requirements while ensuring that the group’s environmental 

ethos has not been compromised.”

In May 2020, 429 Jilin ComfortDelGro Taxi Co. Ltd. drivers 

were deployed to assist the municipal government in helping

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

Employee engagement and satisfaction 

have profound impacts on productivity, 

service quality and our long-term 

business performance. Consistent and 

meaningful two-way communication 

with our employees will allow alignment 

with our business strategy and goals, as 

well as create opportunities for us to be 

responsive to employee needs. Due to 

the dynamic and incredibly uncertain 

circumstances of 2020, it was particularly 

important to have regular and ongoing 

communication with our employees 

to update them with latest business 

operation directives or arrangements.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

We ensure good employee engagement 

through ongoing programmes, labour-

management relations, and talent 

management.

Our employees are at the core of our success. Without them, 

we would not be where we are today. We are committed 

to ensure our employees’ well-being and professional 

development, which are key to sustainable performance 

of the Group. This year, we had to develop new ways of 

engaging with our employees while supporting them in 

developing new capabilities and skills.

LABOUR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

80% of all employees across our global 

operations are covered by Collective 

Agreements and labour relations play a 

prominent role in day-to-day operations 

in the organisation. 

We work hard to maintain a harmonious 

tripartite Labour-Management 

relationship. Management and the 

Union share a relationship built on trust 

and respect as well as the common 

goal of improving employees’ welfare. 

They work closely together and are 

facilitated by Union representatives, 

who are appointed from and by Union 

members. Union representatives serve as 

vital communication channels between 

Management and the Union.

In 2020, our Singapore businesses 

renewed the Collective Agreements 

signed for another three-year period. 

We have completed the negotiations 

for operational changes that affect 

the working conditions and well-

being of employees. Such changes are 

always discussed with the Union, and 

implemented after a consensus is reached. 

Employees affected are typically given 

one to three months’ notice via letters, 

circulars or emails.

Malaysian Bus Drivers and Employees Provided 

Accommodation as Borders Close

In March 2020, the Singapore-Malaysia borders closed as Malaysia 

implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) in a bid to contain the 

COVID-19 outbreak. This resulted in Malaysian SBS Transit employees being 

affected, as they previously commuted across the border daily for work. 

To support their livelihoods and ensure the continuity of bus services in 

Singapore, SBS Transit rushed to secure accommodation for over 1,518 drivers within 24 hours 

after the announcement, allowing our drivers to remain in Singapore as the borders close. 

We also provided accommodation for other Malaysian SBS Transit employees, such as those 

who work in depot and interchange operations, Ops Control Centre, Workshop technicians, 

rail staff and so on. Taking all into account, SBST secured accommodation for 1,646 Malaysian 

employees. 

We secured several hotels and dormitories to house our employees, ensuring their safety and 

comfort as they made the difficult choice to remain in Singapore and away from their families.

EMPLOYEE TRAINING

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

Prior to 2020, ComfortDelGro had already 

been laying the groundwork to prepare for 

disruptions, such as digitalisation, resource 

scarcity and climate change. The past 

year has tested our ability to be agile and 

provided us the opportunity to sharpen 

our focus and accelerate transformation. 

For our organisation to pursue new 

strategies and build new capabilities, our 

employees must be equipped with the 

necessary skills and knowledge. Beyond 

our need for strong and adaptable 

human capital, employee training is also 

part of our commitment to employees’ 

professional development and motivation.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

We invest in a diverse range of training 

programmes for employees, according 

to their needs. Through training and 

development, we ensure that our 

employees are equipped with the relevant 

functional knowledge and operational 

skills they need to perform their jobs well.

DIGITAL TRAINING 

In 2020, we focused on upskilling our 

employees with various digital and 

technology-related capabilities. 

This year, a total of 140 employees from 

across our business units attended a 

Microsoft Office 360 Tutorial. During 

the webinar, participants were taught 

on several features and collaborative 

functions in Microsoft Outlook, One 

Drive, SharePoint and Forms. These tips 

and tricks enabled participants to work 

remotely more effectively. In addition, 

a dedicated MS SharePoint Tutorial was 

also conducted for over 120 employees. 

This tutorial provided a step-by-step 

demonstration on how to create a 

communication and its pages, upload 

content and publish them.

All employees also receive performance 

and career development reviews 

annually. Employees are assessed on 

their competency and contributions, with 

executive-level staff having additional 

key performance tasks and targets to 

meet. Performance reviews also serve 

as a means for employees to better 

understand their strengths and key areas 

of improvement.

DIVERSITY AND NON-

DISCRIMINATION 

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

As a global company, we pride ourselves 

in building and enabling a more equitable 

world. Diversity and non-discrimination 

are crucial for talent attraction and 

retention, innovation, and developing 

a competitive workforce, all of which 

contribute to organisational excellence 

and long-term sustainability of the 

business. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

ComfortDelGro is committed to creating 

a culture of diversity, inclusion, and equal 

opportunity. We strive to provide a fair 

and supportive work environment for all 

our employees, regardless of their age, 

sex, marital status, sexual orientation, 

disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnic 

or national origin, religion, or affiliation to 

any political party or trade union. We aim 

to employ people who reflect the diverse 

nature of society and we value each 

of our employees’ contributions, both 

individually, and as part of the Group.

We comply with relevant government 

regulations on human and labour rights. 

In recruitment advertisements, we do 

not state preferences or requirements 

for age, race, gender or religion. We pay 

special attention to the rights and needs of 

individuals at risk of becoming vulnerable 

or marginalised.

ComfortDelGro adopts a zero-tolerance 

approach towards discrimination of 

any form. Employees are recruited, 

remunerated, trained and promoted based 

on individual competence and merit. 

Complaints of discrimination or unfair 

work practices can be reported to the 

Management, the Union or Authorities 

responsible for employment matters, 

based on the country of operation.

We adhere to the five key principles of fair employment practices – recruiting and 

selecting employees on the basis of merit, treating them fairly and with respect, 

providing them with equal opportunities for training and development, rewarding 

them based on their ability, performance, and contribution and abiding by labour 

laws and the Tripartite Guidelines.

As a global transport solutions provider, our operations have close 

interactions with and hence impact the communities we operate in. 

We believe that safe transport should be equitable and accessible 

to all, and is key in creating an inclusive society.

This year, we also focused our efforts on contributing to the COVID-19 

response across our operations – be it in supporting lives or 

livelihoods. In the most challenging of years, we took extra care to 

support the vulnerable communities in regions we operate.

In 2020, the Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) of 

our North East Line and Downtown Line were 2.04 million 

train-km and 2.09 million train-km respectively, exceeding 

the 1 Million Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) 

target.

ACCESSIBILITY

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

For many, access to transportation is 

vital for independent living. An accessible 

and inclusive transport system is the 

building block of an inclusive society 

and can facilitate poverty alleviation. 

Based on public feedback on the LTA’s 

Land Transport Master Plan 2040, 85% of 

Singapore residents are willing to accept 

delays of one to five minutes to allow 

people like the elderly and wheelchair 

users to board or alight from buses and 

trains. As a provider of land transport 

services, we are committed to providing 

inclusive services that are accessible to all, 

regardless of age or ability.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

We are constantly on the lookout for ways 

to improve and expand our solutions 

in order to enhance the safety and 

accessibility of our vehicles such that we 

are able to serve an even wider range of 

commuters. We are also committed to 

making our workplace accessible to our 

employees. For example, ramps and lift 

access as well as wheelchair-accessible 

restrooms are available at many of our 

buildings both locally and overseas.

DISABILITY-FRIENDLY SERVICES

We invest substantially in wheelchair-

friendly buses that are capable of 

transporting persons-in-wheelchairs 

(PIWs) safely and comfortably. In 

Singapore, 100% of SBS Transit buses are 

wheelchair accessible while over 90% of 

buses are wheelchair accessible in the UK. 

In Singapore, the UK and Australia, drivers 

of our wheelchair-friendly bus services 

are trained in the correct way to deploy 

the ramps and assist the passengers. 

Since December 2018, all SBS Transit 

staff are required to attend training that 

focusses on ComfortDelGro’s eight 

Service Standards for different customers, 

including the elderly and the disabled. 

Trainings are based on a commuter 

inclusiveness approach on care and safety 

for commuters on our buses and trains, 

paying special attention to those with 

special needs, such as the elderly, PIWs, 

parents with children strollers, passengers 

with autism or dementia.

In the UK and Ireland, employees are 

trained in disability awareness and loading 

of wheelchairs onto vehicles. Metroline 

has established internal maintenance 

protocols and procedures to support this, 

such as deploying the wheelchair ramp at 

the garage before any journey is started 

to ensure it is functioning. Metroline 

continues to organise accessibility 

communications activities, campaigns, and 

awareness and sensitivity training sessions 

with various partners throughout the year. 

In Australia, all Forest Coach Lines drivers 

as well as drivers from Blue Mountains 

Transit were trained on assisting the elderly 

and those with disabilities.

In addition to our buses, our taxi services 

are also disabled-friendly. Our cabbies 

are trained to assist PIWs in the correct 

ways. Chengdu ComfortDelGro Qing 

Yang Driving in China is the only driving 

school approved by the Authorities to train 

students with disabilities since 2010. In 

Singapore, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre 

waived the S$850 annual membership fee 

for private driving instructors who train 

learner drivers with handicaps. In London 

and Liverpool, all Hackney Carriages of 

Computer Cab are wheelchair accessible.

Local Communities

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

ComfortDelGro has a longstanding 

commitment to good corporate 

citizenship. We recognise that due to 

our strong presence in communities we 

operate in, we can significantly positively 

impact the wider community. We strive 

to be responsive to the needs of different 

local communities, to create shared value 

for all, and help our local communities 

grow sustainably in tandem with our 

business.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

In 2020, ComfortDelGro supported our 

communities through the COVID-19 

pandemic and took the opportunity to 

strengthen our social licence to operate.

In 2020, we donated over S$1.44 million to 

various charities, social organisations and 

welfare and educational institutions in all 

our locations of operation.

CABBYCARE CHARITY GROUP

CabbyCare is made up of ComfortDelGro 

cabbies who wish to give back to society, 

with the current membership standing 

at 170. These cabbies are involved in the 

delivery of bread, meals and books to the 

needy. They also provide ad hoc transfer 

trips to needy families and elderly poor. 

• 

Bread-On-Wheels (ongoing): Launched 

on 28 May 2003 together with Food 

From The Heart, cabbies distribute 

unsold bread from Sunshine Bakeries 

to charitable organisations. They deliver 

bread three times a week. Currently, 

there are about 20 active CabbyCare 

members on the roster and groups of 

five rotate their shifts for delivery.

• 

Meals-On-Wheels (ongoing): Since 

March 2006, CabbyCare has been 

providing free meal delivery two times 

a week for TOUCH Home Care’s 

Meals-On-Wheels Programme. Our 

cabbies collect and deliver food packs 

to the elderly staying at four different 

locations. Currently, about 80 cabbies 

in groups of six rotate their shifts for 

deliveries.

ENABLING LEARNING FOR NEEDY STUDENTS

With the aim to ease the struggles of 

vulnerable individuals who do not have 

the necessary equipment for home-based 

learning and work during the circuit breaker 

period, Moove Media upcycled discarded 

cardboard boxes which were used to store 

rolls of vinyl stickers for advertisement 

wraps into cardboard tables. It has given 

away about 70 cardboard tables through 

the Early Childhood Development Agency 

(ECDA) and SG Enable.

DONATION IN KIND

Unclaimed articles that are left behind on 

SBS Transit buses and trains and at our bus 

interchanges and MRT stations are donated 

to the Red Cross for sale at its thrift shops 

with the proceeds going towards its 

humanitarian efforts to help the disabled 

and less fortunate in Singapore. In 2019, 

28,359 items were donated.

In January 2020, SBS Transit donated 

250 packets of diapers as well as boxes 

of cakes to elderly residents of Punggol 

Bright Hill Evergreen Home as part of our 

engagement efforts when we conduct LRT 

maintenance works late into the night or 

early in the morning. The Home is located 

near to our LRT tracks.

GIVING FREE USE OF SPACE

At its bus interchanges and MRT stations, 

SBS Transit continues to offer free use 

of publicity spaces to create awareness 

and promote security and community 

messages. This includes crime prevention 

from SPF and graciousness messages 

from gov.sg and Singapore Kindness 

Movement.  

It also sponsored advertising spaces  

on our buses and trains and at our  

premises to promote national campaigns 

such as “Speak Mandarin” and “Speak  

Good English”.

SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT

On an ongoing basis, students visit SBS 

Transit bus interchanges, MRT stations 

and depots to discover more about its 

operations while we conduct school 

talks and mini exhibitions that focus on 

safety and graciousness in public travel. 

In 2020, SBS Transit conducted a total 

of seven sessions which has reached about 

6,016 students.   

SBS Transit also continues to work with 

our Adopt-a-Station/Interchange partners 

and is currently working with the Methodist 

Girls’ School to create posters with happy 

messages to brighten the journeys of 

commuters.  Since its launch in 2016, To-

date, 20 schools have been onboarded.

SBS Transit continues to reach out to 

the elderly in the community through 

its community initiative known as 

the MAGIC CARES Van programme. 

Partnering a social enterprise, I’m Soul 

Inc., SBS Transit employs the sound beam 

technology to encourage the elderly to 

make movements and dance to create 

music. This programme was launched in 

October 2019 with Lions Befrienders and 

St Luke’s ElderCare. On average, about 60-

70 participants attend these sessions per 

week (combined).  In 2020, a total of seven 

sessions were held, but due to COVID-19, 

these have been temporarily suspended.

OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR PEOPLE

Launch of ComfortDelivery and Deployment of Cabbies to 

Alternative Jobs

When the pandemic struck, there was sharp decline in demand for cabs. While rental 

waivers helped ease the financial load of our cabbies, longer term solutions were 

required to support the livelihood of our cabbies and assist them in the transition to a 

new normal.

During the early days of the circuit breaker in Singapore, ComfortDelGro Taxi worked 

with delivery companies and restaurants to provide alternative jobs to cabbies. 

To-date, about over 680 cabbies have been deployed to take on alternative jobs, with close to 110 of them 

deployed to provide delivery services for partners such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, Cedele and 

foodpanda.

In April 2020, we introduced ComfortDelivery, a dedicated food delivery service that enables partner F&amp;B 

establishments to access a fleet of 10,000 taxis to fulfil their orders. Since we launched the app, over 2,175 

cabbies have been successfully onboarded to participate in delivery services.

Apart from delivery services, another 500 cabbies have been deployed to other alternative jobs, including 

providing transport services for COVID-19 suspected patients, safe distance ambassadors, transport 

ambassadors and bus captains. In helping to ensure that Singapore’s healthcare system was not overwhelmed, 

ComfortDelGro taxi drivers stepped in to deliver medicine from public healthcare institutions to patients with 

pre-existing conditions who require regular top-ups. Online training is required before cabbies are allowed to 

handle medication. This has provided cabbies with more options and sources of income, as they keep all the 

delivery fee, which usually cost between $4 and upwards of $20, depending on the volume and speed.



We are grateful to ComfortDelGro Taxi for this initiative. These 

are trying times for everyone and we are glad to be able to 

work together to find mutually beneficial solutions to the 

challenges we all face.

CYBERSECURITY

In an increasingly digital world, 

cybersecurity is and will be a growing 

concern for all. As we find new ways to 

adapt and take advantage of technology 

in our business, we must also develop 

safeguards for data protection and 

strengthen our cybersecurity defences. We 

also strictly comply with all cybersecurity 

and data protection regulations in our 

locations of operation. 

To secure the integrity of our online 

systems, we enhanced our understanding 

of the current attack vectors and the 

associated mitigating behaviours in the 

event of cyber-attacks. To provide the 

highest assurance to our customers on 

protecting and using their personal data, 

we have put in place initiatives to equip 

our Company and our employees with 

essential competencies and capabilities 

in relation to cybersecurity as well as 

approaches to deal with incidences such 

as data breaches.

In 2020, we implemented a mandatory 

Cyber Security Awareness Training 

via an e-learning platform. This was 

disseminated across the Group. New 

staff are required to attend mandatory 

awareness training that inform them of 

the latest information security policies, 

procedures and risks. This is to better 

prepare them to acquire competencies, 

new techniques and methods that are 

essential in mitigating security risks.

WHY THIS ISSUE IS MATERIAL

As our transport services are used by the

We are cognisant that we play an 

increasingly important role in influencing 

public policy and regulatory framework to 

aid transport operators in increasing their 

operating efficiencies and capacities. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS ISSUE

ComfortDelGro regularly engages with 

Governments and Regulators at many 

different levels to help shape public policy 

and regulation that support the land 

transport sector. We work closely with 

Association Partners and Unions  

on issues which affect them and our 

business. We actively incorporate the 

outcomes of these engagements in our 

decision-making processes and ensure 

that we are up to date with the latest 

regulations and stakeholder agreements. 

In doing so, we uphold our accountability, 

high business ethics and integrity to instil 

trust in our Stakeholders. At the same 

time, we expect all business partners, 

suppliers and employees to adhere to our 

guidelines on regulatory compliance and 

ethical conduct.

Information technology (IT) system 

failures are key risks for the Group since 

almost all the businesses rely heavily 

on IT. In recognition of the risks of a 

major system failure – disruption of the 

business, loss of data or a security breach 

of our information technology systems, 

we ensure our information technology 

security management framework 

complies with current industry standards. 

The Group has also implemented various 

controls and data recovery measures to 

mitigate the risks, including the use of 

intrusion prevention systems, multi-level 

firewalls, server protection, software 

code hardening and data loss prevention 

controls to manage Internet security and 

cyber threats. Audits and penetration 

tests are conducted regularly to test 

the integrity of the systems – to identify 

potential vulnerabilities, strengthen the 

security hardening of our websites, and 

ensure that high standards are maintained.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

ComfortDelGro complies with Singapore’s 

Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 

through the Group PDPA Compliance 

Policy. We have also developed a 

Data Breach Management Plan as a 

comprehensive response in the event 

of data and security breaches. The plan 

includes processes for reporting, assessing 

and evaluating risks and impacts of data 

breaches. We plan to review the PDPA 

Compliance Policy every two years and 

whenever there are amendments to the 

PDPA. Relevant internal and external 

stakeholders are updated as and when 

there are changes in policies, plans 

and practices. Compliance audits are 

conducted by the Group on Business Units 

from time to time to ensure adherence to 

the Group’s PDPA policies. 

We have appointed Data Protection 

Officers (DPOs) from various Business 

Units and formed a Data Protection Work 

Group to ensure the compliance of PDPA 

when developing and implementing 

policies and processes for handling 

personal data. This is to foster a data 

protection culture within the organisation 

and Business Units and to facilitate 

the communication of personal data 

protection policies to stakeholders.

We have identified the DPOs and data 

protection support staff to send for 

training in year 2020 as recommended 

by the PDPA competency framework. 

Business Units are also encouraged to 

obtain the Data Protection Trust Mark 

certification to ensure conformance to 

PDPA best practices.

In 2020, there were no political 

contributions made and no incidents of 

socio-economic non-compliance.

To remain at the forefront of the digital 

transformation, in 2020, we appointed Ms 

Siew Yim Cheng as our new Group Chief 

Digital Officer. This new key position will 

oversee all future ventures in the technology-

related arena. 

With this appointment also comes several 

key initiatives and digital solutions under 

ComfortDelGro.

We recognise that increasing digitalisation 

and technology adoption may not be 

equitable to all, and can discriminate based 

on age. In order to bridge this gap, we 

organised a Company-Led Training (CLT) 

Programme for up to 80 mid-career staff. 

We plan to roll out more of such capacity 

building sessions in the future. 

For more information on our digitalisation 

programs, please see page 60-66 of the 

2020 Annual Report.

SUPPORTING INNOVATION

Digital transformation does not start in 

a cubicle. It requires teamwork and a 

conducive platform to imagine, innovate and 

co-create. In June 2020, ComfortDelGro 

held the CDG Global Digital Challenge Demo 

Day, as a chance for our business units to 

showcase their ideas for digital solutions.

CDG Global Digital Challenge hopes to 

build corporate innovation by bringing the 

start-up mindset to the workplace. Open 

to ComfortDelGro employees worldwide, 

the Challenge aims to bring fresh ideas and 

ignite an entrepreneurial spirit within our 

people, and to value-add to their work and 

productivity. Employees are encouraged to 

form cross-functional and global teams to 

identify disruptive ideas that are able to uplift 

ComfortDelGro into the digital era. Funding 

is provided for teams and incentives are in 

place to encourage inter-business unit teams.

SBS Transit introduced e-services for our 

6,200-odd Bus Captains, enabling them to 

use their handphones to carry out a host of 

administrative functions such as checking on 

work rosters and payslips, applying leave and 

reporting incidents and bus defects wherever 

they are. BCs can also access their individual 

driving competency scores generated from 

iSafe to find out about their driving behaviour. 

Using a mobile application, iLink, our BCs 

are given the flexibility to perform these 

functions at their convenience as well as stay 

in touch with the Company through news, 

safety alerts and advisories.

A cleaning robot was also deployed to our 

canteen at the Ulu Pandan Bus Depot.  

It is constantly on the move, sweeping  

and mopping to keep the premises clean 

ENGRAINING A CULTURE OF STRONG  

GOVERNANCE AND INNOVATION

Launch of the myCDC Mobile App

In September of 2020, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre (CDC) launched the  

“myCDC” mobile application. The first of its kind, the app enables learners to log in 

just once with their learner identification and password and book not only lessons 

such as theory, practical, evaluation and simulator training, but also theory and 

practical test dates with Traffic Police. For those learning to drive, the App also  

enables them to track their progress digitally as every completed lesson that is 

recorded on the driving instructor’s tablet is synced to the learner’s profile in the App.

To help learners keep track of their scheduled bookings, push notifications are sent to them twice via the 

App – a day in advance and an hour in advance. In addition, learners can cancel or reschedule bookings, 

top up their stored-value accounts, and update personal details through the app. There is even an online 

merchandise shop that learners and non-learners alike can purchase accessories on-the-go.
