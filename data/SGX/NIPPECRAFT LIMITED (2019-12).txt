1.3 About this Report 

We are pleased to present Nippecraft’s Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2019

Nippecraft’s peers. 

 

We have conducted our second formal materiality assessment with internal stakeholders in the financial year

our business. These Economic, Environmental, Social and Government (“EESG”) matters have been reviewed and 

validated by our Management in FY2019.

United Kingdom for FY2019. Where applicable, past financial year’s data have been included for comparison 

purposes.  

 

We have not sought external assurance on this report but will consider doing so as our reporting matures over 

time. 

 

In our effort to meet the expectations of our stakeholders, we have taken steps to ensure the transparency and 

accountability of our global operations in accordance with the scope of our report.  

 

Our stakeholders’ feedback is the key to defining our sustainability approach. We look forward to your continued

2.0 Approach to Sustainability 

 

2.1 Board’s Statement 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

The Board of Nippecraft Limited is pleased to present our third sustainability report for FY2019.  

 

This report is prepared in accordance to SGX-ST Catalist Rules and guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards. In addition, this report also serves as a platform for Nippecraft to communicate on our 

approach to our practices, performance and targets in relation to our sustainability efforts for FY2019 with our 

stakeholders.   

 

Together with Management, we continue to recognise the importance of sustainability and consider economic, 

environmental, social and governance factors in our decision-making; while focusing on areas that are most 

relevant to our business. As a company that fulfills the lifestyle stationery needs of our customers, there are 

numerous sustainability-related concerns that we need to address on a daily basis. The most important of these 

include measures that we have in place to protect the health and safety of our employees. Our compliance with 

many rules and regulations we are subjected to are also vital for allowing us to continue to operate and maintain 

that important trust between us and our stakeholders.  

 

Back in FY2018, we have formalised our sustainability approach by reviewing our material assessment; and in 

the same year, set performance indicators and targets that will guide our sustainability efforts into FY2019. These 

efforts have resulted in many positive outcomes in terms of our performance during the year.  

 

We would like to thank our stakeholders in working with us in fulfilling our targets and we look forward to your 

continued support and partnership towards our goal of sustainable growth and development.

2.2 Stakeholders’ Engagement 

 

The success that we enjoyed is built upon effective stakeholder engagement. Feedback received from 

stakeholders may greatly influence business performance. From our corporate and overseas offices, our people 

engage with different stakeholder groups on a daily basis. We will strive to keep up with their evolving needs 

and this guides the type of responses required from us. Our approach to stakeholder engagement is detailed in

2.3 Materiality Assessment 

 

A formal materiality assessment was conducted in FY2018 to identify EESG matters which were most material to 

our businesses. In FY2019, these existing matters were reviewed by our Management team during a workshop 

session to shortlist material factors that create a significant impact on our businesses. We will review our material 

matters annually to ensure that it continues to be relevant for our future reporting periods.    

 

Table 2: Four Steps Materiality Assessment Process 

 

1 

Identification  

A list of EESG factors was consolidated through discussions with key management personnel 

across various stationery divisions.  

 

2 

Prioritisation 

The identified EESG matters were evaluated and prioritised by representatives from the various 

stationery divisions; taking into consideration both internal and external stakeholders’ 

perspectives. These EESG matters were subsequently aligned at the Corporate level for 

consistency across the Group stationery divisions.    

 

3 

Validation 

The final list of material factors for FY2019 Sustainability Report was presented to the Board of 

Directors for their validation and approval.  

 

 

4 

Review 

Material matters selected for reporting in FY2018 were reassessed to ensure their continued 

relevance to our operations in FY2019. We will continue to review our material factors on an 

annual basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


10

 

 

A materiality assessment exercise was conducted for FY2019 in accordance with the process described above. 

Incorporating inputs from our stakeholders, our material factors are ranked as follows:

3.0 Economic 

 

3.1 Economic Performance 

 

The scope of this report covers our stationery business operations in Singapore, the United Kingdom (“UK”) 

and Australia in which Nippecraft has an ownership interest of more than 50%. 

 

Our Stationery business has ended FY2019 with a 12% decrease in revenue to US$15.8 million and an 

operating loss of US$1.7 million (FY2018: operating loss of US$1.1 million) due to a continual decline in the 

traditional stationery business, as well as a highly challenging retail environment in both the UK and 

Australia. In the UK, the situation was compounded by the loss of sales from a key customer that went into 

administration. While sales from new markets and lifestyle stationery growth were healthy compared to 

FY2018, these were in the early stage of development and insufficient to cover the core decline in FY2019.  

 

Nevertheless, Nippecraft holds a holistic view in generating long-term profitability and shareholders’ 

returns with a consideration of the interest of various stakeholders identified under the stakeholders’ 

engagement. For example, our classic diaries and notebooks are evolving to portray the personality, lifestyle 

and fashion-sense of the consumers. We will continue looking into improving our consumers’ experience 

by engaging them in a focus group to gather feedback on their experience in using our products and to 

comment on our work in progress to keep up with the ever-changing consumer trends. 

 

For more information on our financial performance in FY2019, please refer to the Annual Report 2019. 

 

 

4.0 Environment 

 

In Nippecraft, we are conscious of our environmental footprint and have been working with our suppliers 

to reduce them. With the growing concern of climate change, it is imperative for us to focus on our effort 

in using sustainably sourced and recyclable materials in our products so that we can contribute to the global 

force to shift the tide of climate change.  

 

4.1 Materials Sourcing 

 

We have suppliers located across Asia. These suppliers supplied the bulk of our finished goods. We often 

update them about our consumers and governmental requirements so that they are prepared for the 

changing needs. For example, we are currently exploring with our suppliers to reduce the use of plastics for 

packaging.  

 

Pulp and Paper are the key raw materials in our finished products. As we continue to embrace sustainable 

sourcing, we are committed to responsible forestry management. As Nippecraft is both FSC and PEFC 

certified, we are committed to increasing the proportion of materials that are certified under the Chain-of-

Custody (“CoC”) programmes. In addition, most of our cover materials are either sourced from FSC or 

Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) accredited suppliers. 

 

In addition to sustainable sourcing, we also adhere to high social and ethical standards along with our supply 

chain. Our Company is a member of SEDEX, a global organisation that helps companies manage an ethical 

supply chain. The SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (“SMETA”) is one of the most widely use audit 

procedures in the world. It provides a globally-recognised way to assess responsible supply chain activities, 

including labour rights, health and safety, the environment and business ethics. Furthermore, we have been 

instrumental in our key vendors adopting the SEDEX standards. 

 

Our materials have passed the stringent checks by the customs of the importing markets and we perform 

ongoing reviews to ensure that we comply with respective market customs regulations. We also review the 

commodity codes on an ongoing basis to ensure we are using the correct codes and therefore pay the 

correct level of duty. Commodity codes are used to classify goods for import and export within the European 


12

 

 

 

Union (“EU”) or outside the EU. The classification aims to pay the right tax and duty and follow the 

respective regulations. We also continued to perform quality checks on our materials to ensure that there 

are no hazardous elements. For example, we ensure that our materials are non-hazardous through the use 

of materials which are REACH certified in particular, the materials used for our book covers. We practise 

ethical sourcing by using materials only from well-established suppliers who are compliant with 

environmental legislation and procedures. 

 

Paper, which makes up approximately 90% of a book, can be recycled. Other elements, which cannot be 

recycled, include book cover materials, ribbon markers and head and tail bands. In the UK, these materials 

are disposed of through a third-party vendor via our distributor. In Australia, the unsold products are 

disposed of through a third-party vendor. The products are sent for 100% recycling. Both third party vendors 

are “Zero Waste to Landfill” sites. The residual non-recoverable waste streams are shredded, baled then air 

dried and exported to Asia to be used in energy production. 

 

During the year, 1,408 (FY2018: 1,797) metric tonnes of materials were used to produce and pack our books 

sold.

4.2 Supplier Environmental Assessment  

 

Our Quality Control team performs regular site visits to our suppliers and check that they are indeed using 

sustainable materials. For all new suppliers, we perform rigorous due diligence checks before appointing 

them. The following reports will also be obtained from them: 

 

1) ISO9001 Quality Management; 

2) ISO14001 Environmental Management Certification; 

3) FSC or PEFC; 

4) SEDEX; and 

5) Social Accountability (SA8000) or Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS 18001). 

 

Any potential vendors who are unwilling or unable to provide the abovementioned reports will not be 

appointed as our vendor. There was no new trade supplier appointed in FY2019. All of our trade suppliers 

are SEDEX certified. We performed a total of six visits to our vendors’ manufacturing facilities and offices in 

FY2019. Customers may also request for the SEDEX audit reports which we will promptly provide to them 

for them to understand how our supply chains are performing.

5.0 Social 

In FY2019, we saw 3% decrease in headcount to 69 employees. This was mainly due to the reduction of three 

part-time employees offset by an increase of one full-time employee.

 Table 4: Newly employed staff by Countries 

 As at 31 December 2019 

As we are operating within a fast-moving consumer goods industry, people are our greatest asset that serve as an 

important point of contact between our customers and Nippecraft. It is a priority for us to equip them with the 

required skill sets so that they can be at their best at all times. This includes functions like customer service, sales, 

procurement, warehousing, quality assurance, product development, human resources, administrative and 

finance. We hope to continue to improve their skills to meet the changing demands of the industry. 

Nippecraft is committed to fair employment, elimination of discrimination and encouraging diversity 

amongst our workforce.

5.1 Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

 

We embrace diversity, and at the same time expect employees to be aligned with the Group’s vision and 

strategic initiatives. The age of our staff ranges from the 20s to the 60s. Our staff consists of people coming 

from different nationalities and academic qualifications but we strive for fair treatment. We are committed 

to providing competitive remuneration and benefits to our employees. 

 

The employees in our Group comprise of union and non-unionised members. In Singapore, a collective 

bargaining agreement between the Company and the Building Construction and Timber Industries 

Employee Union covers all our locally engaged employees other than staff holding managerial and 

confidential positions. Our employees in the UK and Australia are not unionised. 

 

In both FY2019 and FY2018, 44% of the senior management team comprised of females. The Board 

continues to believe that with existing gender equality in the senior management team, the Group can 

continue to expect diversity of ideas and innovative breakthroughs. Nippecraft will continue to ensure 

gender equality on the boards of all our subsidiaries as well as the senior management team.

5.2 Code of Conduct 

 

The Group sets out the expected code of conduct in its employee handbook. During the year, the Group 

has updated the business ethics guidelines that required to be adhered to in dealings with both customers 

and vendors. Nippecraft ensures compliance with labour and employment laws, including working hours. 

The Group does not discriminate against anyone because of age, gender, national origin, disability, religion, 

sexual orientation, marital or maternity status, union membership or political opinion, among others. An 

Equality and Diversity Policy has been established within the Group to show our commitment towards 

promoting equality and diversity and to ensure that individuals are treated fairly and valued as a member 

of a team. The Company recognises that it has clear obligations towards all employees to ensure they are 

treated fairly. There are channels to report any non-compliance in relation to discrimination through our 

whistle-blowing system. 

 

Nippecraft’s Grievance Policy encourages employees to freely communicate with their immediate 

supervisor or human resource personnel. This is to ensure that problems are aired and resolved as quickly 

as possible. In the event that issue cannot be resolved at the operational level, it will be escalated to the 

next level of the organisational hierarchy.  

 

In 2019, there was no known instance of discrimination or reported discrimination received.

5.3 Training and Education  

 

Training in Nippecraft begins at the induction stage of our new hires. Our employees go through a host of 

internal coaching programmes including selling, customer service, procurement, inventory control, human 

resources and finance. 

 

Nippecraft understands that staff training and development paves the way for the Group to progress into 

the future. One of our initiatives is to re-deploy our staff to assume new roles while leveraging on their 

expertise amidst the evolving business model that we operate in. Staff is encouraged to go for courses and 

seminars to upgrade themselves and improve their skills. We set-off into FY2019 with a training target of 

no less than 137 hours. At the end of FY2019, 210 training hours were provided to our employees.

5.7 COVID-19 

 

 

While we continue to focus on sustaining our businesses during this challenging period, our employees’ 

health and safety remain as our top priorities. We have adopted the following measures in response to 

the COVID-19 for all our global operations: 

 

(a) Work from Home arrangement; 

(b) providing staff with the necessary equipment to work from home; 

(c) rigorous cleaning for warehouse facility that is still open;  

(d) maintaining social distancing for warehousing; 

(e) applied and obtained “Safe Entry” QR code (for the purpose of contact tracing) for entry and exit 

from the warehouse premise in Singapore.  

 

 

6.0 Governance 

 

Our ability to integrate sustainable initiatives and processes is the critical factor for business continuity. Our 

Board is overall responsible for sustainability and integration of EESG factors in the formulation of our 

business strategy. Management will then set the sustainability direction for our business operations. This 

includes the target setting and execution of initiatives. Management will report the sustainability 

performance to the Board on an annual basis,  

 

6.1 Minority Representation 

 

Our Board consists of four members of which three are independent directors. This will ensure that the 

interests of the minority shareholders are protected and that their voices will be heard. 

 

6.2 Policies and Practices 

 

Strong corporate governance and good business ethics provide foundation support for many successful 

organisations in the world.  Nippecraft aligns itself to the industry’s best practices and strives to meet 

stakeholders’ expectation. As part of our corporate governance framework, a set of policies, such as the 

Code of Conduct (refer to 5.2 Code of Conduct) and Whistle-blowing Policy, has been formulated to guide 

us on the right way to conduct business responsibly.   

 

We strive to maintain the highest standard of accountability, fairness and integrity. Our employees are 

informed of their expected conduct during onboarding. We also encouraged them to raise any complaints 

or feedback regarding questionable accounting, audit matters, internal controls or any matter that breaches 

the Group policy, corruption and employee misconduct in accordance with our Whistle-Blowing Policy.  

Please refer to the Corporate Governance section of Nippecraft’s Annual Report 2019 for further 

information. 

 

6.3 Enterprise Risk Management 

 

Our Board recognised its responsibilities over the governance of risks and has set in place management 

procedures for ensuring a sound system of risk management and internal controls. These procedures 

include a structured Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) programme to Nippecraft and its subsidiaries, 

management reviews of key transactions, and the assistance of independent consultants such as external 

and internal auditors to review financial statements and internal controls covering key risk areas. 

 

The key components of the ERM programme are as follows: 

 

a) Risk Management Manual; 

b) Risk Appetite of the Company; and  

c) 

Risk Assessment and Monitoring. 


18

 

 

 

 

By identifying and managing risks through the ERM programme, we should be able to make more informed 

and collective decisions and to benefit from a better balance between risk and reward. As part of the 

programme, Management will also have more structured review processes as new risks emerge to 

cognisant the potential impact from such new risks and to undertake meaningful measures to address 

them. 

 

More information on our Corporate Governance can be found in Nippecraft’s Annual Report 2019.
