The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the Sustainability Report of Tiong Woon 

Corporation Holding Ltd and its Singapore subsidiaries (“Tiong Woon” or “the Group”) for the financial 

year ended 30 June 2020. The report highlights the Group’s unwavering commitment towards its 

sustainability goals even amidst the uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The carefully 

considered impacts of the pandemic on its management approach towards its material economic, 

environmental, social and governance matters, as well as its performance for the reporting year, 

have been included in this year’s report. To guide the Group’s recovery, the Board has performed a 

thorough assessment of the current outlook and its associated risks on Tiong Woon’s operating and 

financial operations, and ensured that risk response plans are in place for business continuity. Prudent 

management of cash flows and ensuring adequate liquidity are key priorities for the Group in this 

period. While the pandemic has impacted business activities and earnings in the 4th quarter, the impact 

was partially cushioned by relief and support measures by the Singapore Government, and the Group 

has emerged profitable for the financial year. 

Notwithstanding COVID-19, the Board continues to ensure that Tiong Woon’s material sustainability 

matters are managed, monitored and incorporated into the Group’s business strategy. Working 

closely with management, the Board maintains oversight over the Group’s sustainability practices, 

performance and disclosures. The Board has reassessed the material matters and confirmed that they 

remain relevant for the business.

The Group strives to deliver long-term value to its key stakeholders, and will continue integrating 

sustainability into its operations to achieve this goal.

SUSTAINABILITY

APPROACH








MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

Tiong Woon defines material sustainability matters as matters that have significant impacts on the Group, our key 

stakeholders and our external environment. In FY2020, Tiong Woon conducted a review of our material matters in 

context of recent developments and determined ‘employee well-being’ to be a new material matter. In addition to 

the four previously identified material matters, the Board has reviewed and validated all five material matters for their 

relevance to Tiong Woon in FY2020. We will continue to review the material sustainability matters on annual basis to 

ensure their relevance to our business.   

Figure 5. Materiality Assessment Process 

In FY2018, we performed 

a materiality assessment 

exercise:

• Identification 

where 

a comprehensive list 

of EESG matters was 

generated through high 

level peer review, media 

reviews and series of 

interviews 

with 

key 

management personnel 

across departments

• Prioritisation of material 

sustainability matters 

through 

materiality 

assessment workshop, 

taking into 

account 

both 

internal 

and 

external stakeholders 

perspectives 

• Validation and review 

of four material matters 

and three additional 

sustainability matters

• In FY2020, we conducted 

another review of our 

material sustainability 

matters. This year,  this 

review was done in 

the context of current 

emerging issues such as 

the pandemic 

• Based on this review, 

Tiong 

Woon 

now 

considers 

‘employee 

well-being’, which was 

previously an additional 

reporting matter, to be a 

new material issue

• In total, Tiong Woon 

will be reporting on five 

material issues and two 

additional sustainability 

matters

• In FY2019, we conducted 

a review of the material 

matters and found them 

to still be relevant across 

our operations

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Upholding high standards of corporate governance is essential to ensuring the sustainability of our business, and 

maximising the value of our stakeholders. We understand that any breaches of business ethics and non-compliance 

to laws and regulations can irreparably affect the Group’s reputation, and lead to the revocation of our licenses and 

the imposition of penalties. Our steadfast commitment towards corporate governance is reflected in all Tiong Woon’s 

operations and interactions with suppliers and customers.

Corporate Governance Policies and Initiatives

Tiong Woon strives toward the strictest standards of compliance with widely accepted corporate governance practices. 

Over the years, the Group has established specific policies and procedures to guide our business activities. 

Figure 7. Corporate Governance Policies and Procedures

Policies/Procedures

Description

Whistleblowing Policy

Outlines the procedure to raise any identified cases of fraud, corruption, or other 

dishonest practices in the workplace.

Employee Code of Ethics

Provides guidelines for employees’ expected conduct in various business dealings, 

such as commitment to safeguarding confidential information, appropriate 

workplace mannerisms, avoiding or handling conflicts of interests, ethical use of 

company property and responsible social networking.

Employee Code of Conduct

Sets out the standard of conduct and performance for all employees as well as the 

appropriate corrective actions for any breaches of the standard.

The Audit Committee plays an active, vital role in ensuring good corporate governance within the Group. Regular 

sessions are conducted to keep employees updated on our corporate governance policies. In addition, all employees are 

briefed on the business code of conduct upon joining the company as part of their orientation programme.  

Our Targets And Performance

In FY2020, we met our targets of maintaining zero confirmed incidents of corruption and zero confirmed incidents of 

non-compliance with applicable environmental and socioeconomic laws and regulations.

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IMPACT AND RESPONSE

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced organisations globally to re-think how daily business is run. With stricter 

government directives mandating certain measures such as social distancing to be implemented at the workplace, 

Tiong Woon has made conscious efforts to ensure that these additional safety regulations have been complied with 

throughout the organisation. The initiatives that we have introduced in response to these requirements are listed in 

the Health and Safety COVID-19 highlight on page 18 of this report.  

Additionally, employees working remotely en masse for the first time during the circuit breaker period in Singapore 

has posed several challenges in connectivity, security, and management with regards to IT.

To address these issues, we have introduced new measures and stepped up on our IT controls in response to the 

assessed risks. Examples of actions we have taken include:

• 

Leveraging remote desktops, virtual private networks, and virtual desktop tools

• 

Placing strict restrictions that prevent direct access to the main network and core system 

• 

Providing basic training to employees on the proper and secure way to do their work

• 

Re-distributing the internet bandwidth to cope with the additional loads and demands of mass remote work 

• 

Increasing the monitoring of network and IT infrastructure to ensure

 ▪

No network disruptions  

 ▪

No unauthorised access (malicious or accidental) from direct hacking attacks, malware infections, or 

internal threats 

 ▪

No misuse of information (or privileges) by an authorised user, via unapproved use of data or unapproved 

changes made 

To ensure business continuity, we have also:

• 

Added a new feature in applications to allow users to print documents in pdf format instead of using a 

pre-printed form, so that customer billing and purchasing activities could continue as per normal

• 

Supported and trained employees on how to use collaboration and telecommunication tools to substitute 

face-to-face interactions

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Economic performance is imperative for the Group as ensuring steady, sustainable growth remains a key focus for us. At 

Tiong Woon, we are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to grow our business and provide positive financial 

returns to all our shareholders. We also recognise our role as a key player in developing the local economy. Our economic 

footprint has direct and indirect impacts on the countries we operate in.

Economic Performance Policies and Initiatives

We stay ahead of the competition by placing great emphasis on responding quickly and effectively to the challenging 

business environment the best that we can. As the pandemic continues to bring uncertainty to markets and the risk of 

disruptions to business activities, the Group will focus on its core competencies and leverage its strong track record as a 

one-stop integrated services provider in project management for heavy lift and haulage; and marine transportation. With 

the Group’s global network and business presence, Tiong Woon remains focused to drive growth, improve profitability and 

enhance stakeholders’ value. 

Economic Targets and Performance

Tiong Woon is committed to creating and distributing economic value across our operations. In FY2020, the Group’s 

economic value generated1 amounted to $124.7 million, compared to $117.2 million in the previous year. The growth was 

especially evident in its core heavy lift and haulage segment, which saw a 97% increase in profit before tax from FY2019, due 

to improved performance, and higher government grant income. With the current uncertain operating environment, the 

Group is focusing its efforts on managing its cash flow, operating costs and business risks, in order to sustain its performance 

through the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. $119.5 million of the economic value generated by Tiong Woon in 

FY2020 was distributed2 through various forms including taxes to the government, purchases from suppliers, compensation 

to employees and investments into communities. This represents a 5% increase in economic value distributed from FY2019.

Full details of the Group’s financial information can be found in Annual Report FY2020.

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IMPACT AND RESPONSE

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global economic activity and that of our customers, many of 

whom are construction companies who have had to suspend operations during the circuit breaker shutdown period 

implemented by the Singapore government. In turn, this has had an impact on our business activities. However, with 

the pandemic situation improving in Singapore and the easing of measures, we are seeing the gradual resumption of 

our business activity levels and performance.

To ensure that Tiong Woon’s financial position remains strong, we have begun following up more closely on our 

customers’ payment and credit terms and introducing measures to tighten operational expenses. This has helped to 

improve cash flows. 

We have also started to use simulations to anticipate the worst. These simulations have provided the basis for 

immediate cost cutting measures and have simultaneously helped to fine-tune our revenue forecasts to provide 

more accurate and timely figures for better cashflow management. By analysing our customers’ profile and payment 

pattern, we have also been able to gain critical decision-making insights on our customer risk profiles.

We are now more careful about going into business with new downstream customers and have introduced enhanced 

background checks on new customers’ financial and project standings. This prevents us from being in a position of 

dispute when it comes to future invoicing and payment.

Economic value generated is the revenue of the the Group’s operations in Singapore and overseas subsidiaries during the reporting period. The full list 

of our operations can be found on page 3 of Annual Report FY2020.

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH


Our core values build the foundation for the customer service excellence that Tiong Woon prides itself on. To ensure that high 

quality and safe services are delivered to the satisfaction of our customers, we have focused our efforts on implementing an 

effective quality control system; adhering to rigorous workplace health and safety standards; and developing a well-trained, 

capable workforce. 

Figure 8. Tiong Woon’s Core Values 

EFFECTIVE QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM

Quality Control Policies and Procedures 

The Group’s Quality Policy in our Quality Manual helps us manage and support our operations in a way that meets the needs 

and expectations of our customers. This policy covers all operations in Singapore, and its implementation is overseen by 

the Quality Committee, which is headed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Quality Committee holds monthly meetings to 

review quality performance to ensure that all issues are addressed in a timely manner. 

At every step of a typical engagement, the Group takes extra care to honour our commitment to quality. Upon receipt of an 

engagement request, our sales staff ensure that the customer is matched to the right service. A formal project proposal is 

provided after a thorough site visit and assessment by our technical sales staff. During this process, sales staff can leverage 

on the integrated nature of our service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution to our clients. 

During the execution of a project, we take great care to avoid equipment breakdown as it results in costly project delay. 

We ensure that the operators and technicians working on site are competent for the job. Besides compulsory equipment 

familiarity training, the operators have a direct communication channel for ongoing technical support from head office. 

 

In the unfortunate case of an equipment malfunction, the technical team will be mobilised immediately for operation 

recovery. Subsequently, a root cause analysis will be conducted to guard against recurrence of the same issue. 

As a reflection of our commitment to deliver quality services to our customers, the Group’s Quality Management System is 

ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 certified.

Customer Satisfaction Targets and Performance

Customer satisfaction is of great importance to Tiong Woon, and this commitment to constantly improve customer 

satisfaction levels is directed from the top. Consistent with this commitment, we regularly gather customer feedback on 

the quality of our services via open channels such as email and hotline, and via an annual customer satisfaction survey we 

send out to randomly selected clients. In FY2020, we surveyed 8 such clients, down from 29 clients surveyed in FY2019 

due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of sites. The survey allowed customers to rate the five main services 

offered by the Group against varied assessment criteria such as equipment reliability, response time to breakdown 

recovery, and punctuality. The feedback was consolidated and reviewed, and appropriate courses of action were taken 

to further improve our services. The FY2020 survey results pertaining to the Group’s services are presented in Figure 9.

Overall, the Group achieved a customer satisfaction rating of 69.3% in FY2020. This was a slight decrease from the customer 

satisfaction rating of 69.6% in FY2019. Despite the decrease in the overall customer satisfaction rating, 7 out of the 8 

customers surveyed indicated that they would recommend our services to others. We are humbled by the confidence that 

our customers have indicated in our services, and will continue to raise our standards based on the comments we have 

received. Figure 10 outlines the improvement plan that we have formulated based on feedback obtained from the customer 

satisfaction survey.

In FY2020, we also brought some clients to China for a factory visit to introduce our new product range. It was a great 

educational experience for both our clients and our team, as we had the chance to better understand our customers’

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IMPACT AND RESPONSE

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it new challenges in serving our customers and meeting their needs. To 

cater to this, we have taken action in four main areas.

Ensuring business continuity to avoid service disruptions 

We have established a cross-functional, inter-department and inter-subsidiary response team within the organisation to 

combat the virus. This team has also set in place a Business Continuity Plan to ensure that our customers’ requirements 

are fulfilled promptly, and that the Group is kept up to date with the latest developments of the pandemic around 

the world.

In addition to this, our supply chain stabilisation plan ensures that we have contingency plans in place for outsourcing 

equipment and manpower in the event of a sudden service disruption, such as when workers have to be quarantined. 

We have also further built on existing business relationships with our upstream suppliers to establish strategic 

partnerships, so that their services can be called on in the event of an emergency.  All these ensure that the requirements 

of our customers are not at risk of compromise.

Supporting our customers’ recovery

We are highly committed to supporting our customers’ recovery in this difficult period, particularly those whose 

operations have been greatly disrupted by COVID-19. For our customers in the construction sector, for instance, their 

operations were halted during the mandated circuit breaker period, resulting in costly project delays. To support 

them, we have collected information on details such as our customers’ job and payment patterns to inform our 

decisions on how we could best assist. Where feasible, we have allowed certain concessions to payment timelines to 

help them with their immediate challenge of managing their operating costs.

Emphasising health and safety

With a focus on minimising social contact and promoting contact tracing and safe travel, we have worked with certain 

customers to stagger the working hours at job sites, and mandated the use of mobile attendance apps for our sales-

related personnel.

Building rapport and maintaining transparent communication

We see the importance of going the extra mile to build rapport with our customers to understand their needs in this 

difficult time. As such, where face-to-face meetings have not been possible, we have continued to maintain consistent 

communication over the phone or through video conferencing channels such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Skype.

RIGOROUS HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS

Health and Safety Policies and Procedures

We want to build a safe and healthy work environment that is conducive to our employees’ well-being and productivity. We 

recognise that occupational health and safety is essential for our business objectives and customer service excellence, and 

are fully committed to achieving sound Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) performance. The COVID-19 outbreak has 

particularly foregrounded the importance of having in place established systems to ensure this. To this end, Tiong Woon 

has a group level HSE Policy which is reviewed on an annual basis. We have also attained Occupational Health and Safety 

Assessment System 18001:2007 and bizSAFE Level Star certifications, which bears further testament to the rigour of the 

management systems we have in place to ensure a safe working environment. 

For our marine operations, we have a separate Quality, Health, Safety and Environment (“QHSE”) Policy and QHSE 

Management System to address safety hazards at sea. Our employees are required to obtain all necessary certifications 

such as ship firefighting and piracy mitigation prior to work assignment to ensure they are well equipped to work in risky 

maritime operations. Our system is compliant with local and international maritime law.

To monitor and track HSE performance as well as to oversee the implementation of HSE programmes, a dedicated HSE 

committee has been set up at the group-level. This committee consists of representatives from the Group’s subsidiaries and 

projects. 

Regular safety programmes such as regular toolbox meetings, campaigns, and emergency fire drills are conducted 

throughout the year. A safety training matrix has been maintained to ensure that relevant employees are equipped with 

essential safety skills and knowledge. Tiong Woon also organises bi-monthly management walkabouts to monitor and 

assess any safety-related hazards. 

Independent audits are also performed on a regular basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our policies and management 

system. We have also undertaken several internal audits at our operations in Singapore during this reporting period. Our 

FY2020 HSE Programmes for the first half of the year are listed below4.

Health and Safety Targets and Performance

Our annual health and safety performance report is prepared on a calendar year basis to align with the reporting requirements 

of the Ministry of Manpower Singapore. For sustainability reporting purposes, we have supplemented this with the interim 

health and safety performance data from January to June 2020.

Comparing the full 2019 calendar year data with the full 2018 calendar year data, overall injury rate has fallen significantly 

from 9.2 in 2018 to 3.4 in 2019. In the first half of 2020, overall injury rate was at 2.4. The details of our HSE performance is 

presented in Figure 11 below.

Despite our best efforts to provide a safe working environment for our employees and workers, in FY2020, we had 3 cases 

of injuries from July to December 2019 and 3 cases of injuries from January to June 2020. Based on our investigations, these 

injuries mainly arose from non-adherence to safety protocol when using or moving equipment, and from random accidents 

such as workers tripping. To prevent re-occurrence of these incidents, we have added safety guidance specific to each 

incident to our monthly safety briefings conducted for all employees and workers. As one of the incidents also related to a 

technician’s foot being pinned by a steel plate on the ground, we have also released an additional directive for unlevel steel 

plates on the ground to be welded down, so that they would not move when heavy vehicles go past it.

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACT AND RESPONSE

Ensuring the health and safety of our people has been of utmost priority in this COVID-19 pandemic. For Tiong Woon, 

our safety management monitoring plan consisted of:

• 

Appointing Safe Management Officers to assist in the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the 

Safe Management Measures in the workplace

• 

Dividing office employees into teams, and staggering work shifts at the office with work from home 

arrangements to reduce physical interaction and ensure safe distancing at the workplace. During the circuit 

breaker period, at least 50% of employees worked from home

• 

Mandating contact tracing via the safe entry visitor management system 

• 

Replacing physical meetings with virtual meetings and banning activities with close prolonged contact 

interactions between fieldsmen, office staff, salespeople and engineering personnel were also limited

• 

Enforcing safe distancing measures of keeping employees at least 1 metre apart 

• 

Enforcing the use of face masks at the workplace   

• 

Encouraging all employees to practise good personal hygiene

• 

Placing hand sanitisers in various locations such as the security counter, reception area, dormitory and 

pantries, and ensuring that surgical masks, disposable gloves, N-95 masks, thermometers, alcohol-based 

hand sanitisers and disinfectants were in adequate supply for issuance

• 

Increasing the cleaning frequency of office and dormitory premises, and common touchpoints such as lift 

buttons, door knobs and dining tables. This included a routine ‘Weekend disinfection wipe down’ to disinfect 

all workstations

Additionally, in our dormitories, we have instituted movement control measures to ensure that all dormitory residents 

leave the dormitory only for work or medical reasons. It is encouraged that only the appointed room in-charge buys 

food, and work transportation is arranged by the company. All residents are required to physically sign in and out of 

the premises with their name, room number and mobile number.

EMPLOYEES PROFILE 

In FY2020, we had a total of 681 employees across our operations in Singapore. All employees were hired on a full-time 

basis and most were hired on a permanent contract. The total number of employees fell slightly by 1% compared to FY2019. 

This can be attributed to natural variation in the total number of employees. Tiong Woon has not had any COVID-19 related 

retrenchment exercises in FY2020. Tiong Woon has a notably higher proportion of male employees (95.5%) as compared 

to the female employees (5.5%) due to the nature of our business. The detailed profile of our employees is shown in Figure 

12 below.

EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING

The Group believes that our employees’ well-being is a pre-requisite to retaining and enhancing their productivity. This is 

especially the case in difficult times such as that of the current pandemic. Rapid changes in the working environment can 

have an impact on the physical and mental health of our employees. As such, the Group takes extensive steps towards 

ensuring the overall health and well-being of our workforce and providing competitive employment benefits.

Employee Well-Being Policies and Initiatives

Our employment benefits and welfare policies are outlined in the Group’s Human Resources manual. Personal Accident 

Insurance Policies and/or Workmen Compensation Policies with disability/invalidity coverage are provided to all staff. In 

addition, all employees are covered with health care benefits such as hospitalisation and surgical insurance plan, critical 

illness insurance plan, medical care and dental care, with varying coverage according to employee category. Likewise, all 

staff are entitled to various types of leave such as annual, childcare, compassionate, marriage, training and examination 

leave, according to employee category.

To promote the overall well-being of our employees and raise awareness on the topic, Tiong Woon has set up a fitness and 

wellness club which organises various fitness and recreation activities. Employees can exercise regularly at our gym facilities 

and class studios. In addition, a recreation lounge with karaoke system is provided for employees to relax and promote team 

bonding. Employees are also allowed to book the recreation lounge to bring their families during weekends for any family 

celebrations to enhance employee’s family bonding.

Employee Engagement

The Group takes the opportunity to understand the concerns of our employees through engagement sessions such as town 

halls and feedback/suggestion boxes. During these engagement sessions, a wide range of topics are covered including 

teamwork, information sharing, relationship with superior, work and life balance, job passion and fairness at work. The 

Group also conducts town hall biannually to share with employees on the company’s performance and improvement plans 

to engage with our employees.

Talent Development Policies and Procedures

Tiong Woon believes that a well-trained workforce is key to distinguishing our services from the competition. As such, Tiong 

Woon is committed to the professional development of our employees to ensure that they are equipped with the skills 

necessary to contribute to the continued success of the Group.

The Group has several in-house and external training programmes that focus on both technical knowledge as well as 

soft skills such as being assertive at work, and customer service excellence. The Group has also established a mentorship 

programme to assist new joiners in their onboarding  process.

Annual performance appraisals are conducted to assess employees’ performance. A face-to-face meeting will be held 

between employees and their respective heads of department to discuss their job performance, including their areas of 

responsibilities and improvements. This process is guided by the performance management procedure adopted by the 

Group. 

Training Target and Performance

In FY2020, the Group recorded a total of 6,722 training hours, averaging 10.3 training hours per employee. This was a slight

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: EQUIPPING OUR EMPLOYEES WITH MULTIPLE SKILLSETS DURING COVID-19

At client worksites, additional restrictions have been put in place to meet the safe distancing guidelines set by 

the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). One of the primary impacts this has had on our operations is the limitation 

on the number of employees that can be stationed on site at a given time. Apart from  general activities such 

as crane operations which can be carried out despite these restrictions, other specialised activities that may 

require specific skills such as rigging and signalling, or forklift operations, may not be able to be carried out due 

to site headcount restrictions. Such  restrictions can cause significant delays to the works and affect the delivery 

of our service to our customers. As such, Tiong Woon recognises that equipping our employees with multiple 

skillsets has become critical in this new workplace environment. We have started sending our employees for 

various specialised trainings, both in-house and external, to equip them with multiple skillset competencies.  

Conducting in-house training in the COVID-19 environment poses several new logistical challenges to us. For example, 

we are unable to invite professional trainers who are based overseas to attend in-person training within our training 

facilities. In addition, there are also restrictions placed in the classroom space due to social distancing requirements.  

Despite these challenges, Tiong Woon continues to conduct our in-house training by adopting new protocols within 

our training rooms. Examples of these protocols include:

• 

Adopting digital teaching resources such as online instructional videos, webinar, etc.

• 

Ensuring that employees are sufficiently spaced out in the training room

• 

Requiring employees to wear masks in the training room 

Such arrangements have allowed Tiong Woon to continue its training and development efforts with minimal disruption 

despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.

CARING FOR

THE ENVIRONMENT

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSIONS

Energy efficiency plays a key role in our effort to reduce our environmental footprint. It also contributes to the profitability 

of the Group by lowering our operating costs. Tiong Woon uses a phased approach to manage our energy consumption 

and environmental impacts.

Energy Efficiency Policies and Initiatives

The Group’s energy consumption includes the usage of diesel and Marine Gas Oil (“MGO”) for fuel as well as electricity from 

the grid.

Fuel is used to operate heavy lift and haulage equipment, tugboats, barges, and other supporting vehicles. To reduce 

fuel consumption, the group optimises operational efficiency through the use of fuel-efficient equipment, performing 

maintenance on equipment and by educating operators on fuel efficiency behaviors. 

Electricity consumption covers usage at our Singapore properties including our tenants’ activities, workshop and offices, 

workers’ dormitory and jetty. To reduce electricity consumption, several meters are installed to give better insight into the 

consumption patterns at the compounds. The input allows our Estate Management Team to track the energy consumption 

regularly for any irregularities. 

Energy Targets and Performance

In FY2020, Tiong Woon consumed a total of 67,902 GJ of fuel and 1,605 MWh of electricity (5,777 GJ of electrical energy). 

This was a slight increase of 9.75% in total energy use when compared to 2019. This increase in energy use can largely be 

attributed to an increase in economic activity in the first-half of FY2020. While there was a decrease in energy use during 

the circuit-breaker period, this decrease was offset by an increase in energy use in our dormitories. Direct energy intensity 

and indirect energy intensity increased marginally from 0.71 to 0.74 MJ per SGD and 0.0170 to 0.0176 KWh per SGD 

respectively. An overview of energy use is provided in Figure 18 and Figure 19 below.

CARING FOR

THE ENVIRONMENT


This section explains the calculation boundaries, methodologies and assumptions used in the computation of Tiong Woon 

energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

Reporting Scope and Period

Tiong Woon adopts the Operational Control Approach, as outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, is used to 

determine organisational boundaries. This attributes accountability for 100% of the GHG emissions from operations over 

which the organisation has control. 

Data for energy and GHG emissions consumption from the following reporting periods have been included in the 

Sustainability Report FY2020:

• FY2018: 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018

• FY2019: 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019

• FY2020: 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020

Energy Consumption within the Organisation

Energy consumption is consumed from purchased electricity, diesel and MGO consumption in Singapore. The total energy 

consumption is expressed in Gigajoules (Gj). 

Energy and Carbon Intensity

Electricity consumption covers usage at our Singapore properties including our tenants’ activities, workshop and offices, 

workers’ dormitory and jetty. Intensity metrics are calculated relative to effective Gross Floor Area (GFA), expressed as  

kWh/sq m.

GHG Emissions

Scope 1 emissions are calculated from the consumption, natural gas and MGO in Singapore, expressed in tonnes of CO2. 

Scope 2 emissions are calculated from the consumption of grid electricity in Singapore, expressed in tonnes of CO2. 

Emission Factors 

Scope 1: Emission factors for direct energy consumption are taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 

(IPCC) emission factor database (i.e. 74.1 tCO2/TJ for diesel and 56.1 tCO2/TJ for natural gas).

Scope 2: Emission factors for the calculation of electricity consumption are taken from the Singapore Energy Statistics 2019 

published by the Energy Market Authority in Singapore (0.4188kg CO2/kWh), as well as the National Greenhouse Accounts 

Factors published in August 2019.
