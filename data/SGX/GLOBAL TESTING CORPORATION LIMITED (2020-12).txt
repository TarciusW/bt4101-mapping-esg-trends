BOARD STATEMENT  

Dear Esteemed Stakeholders, 

We, the Board of Directors ("Board") of GTCL, are pleased to present our sustainability report for FY2020, 

which will be published through SGXNet. 

We believe that merging sustainability in our business strategy is fundamental to achieving continuous 

success, and we are fully committed to cultivate a corporate culture that values sustainable business 

practices. 

The Board is devoted to assuring and boosting our stakeholders’ interest through the incorporation of 

their viewpoints in responsible ESG business management. We build lasting relationships with our 

stakeholders by initiating regularly planned dialogues. 

GTCL recognises the impact of sustainability to business strategy and success in the long run. Risks and 

opportunities must be exceptionally managed along with meeting the economic, environmental, and 

social demands on a sound governance foundation. Our robust governance framework strives to 

maintain integrity, transparency, accountability and discipline throughout our business activities. We 

are confident to play a big role in environmental preservation, social inclusion and accomplishing 

financial milestones by establishing a clear tone from the top. GTCL’s dedication to drive environmental 

stewardship and fostering safe working conditions for employees to thrive in is evident as we continue 

to align goals towards that direction. 

 

Figure 3: GTCL’s Governance Framework 

Under the Board’s strong leadership and guidance, the management will continue to strengthen our 

performance by integrating material ESG factors in our business operations. We seek to develop a more 

sustainable business in the interest of our stakeholders and the community.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  

Our stakeholders are fundamental to ensuring long-term sustainable growth for the Group. GTCL 

recognises the importance of consistently embedding ESG factors into our business operations to meet 

the expectations and interests of our stakeholders. 

GTCL consistently engages with our stakeholders through different channels during FY2020. We firmly 

believe that communication is paramount to ensure that discussions around our sustainability initiatives 

can be exchanged effectively. Currently, we conduct workshops, surveys and external audits to evaluate 

our business operations, as well as to ensure compliance with rules and regulations. We are confident 

that this approach will provide alignment with our stakeholders as we work towards reaching our 

operational, reporting and organisational objectives.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

GTCL conducted its fourth materiality assessment to identify the ESG topics material to the Group and 

our stakeholders in 2020. The materiality assessment was conducted with the help of an external 

consultant, and we will continue to seek their services in the future. 

We also revised our ESG indicators for GRI 403 (Occupational Health and Safety), as the GRI Standards 

was revised to maintain relevance and usability in the sustainability reporting front.

CLIENT SATISFACTION  

OUR APPROACH 

The Group conducts a yearly customer satisfaction survey with our primary customer lines, which 

comprises of probing and final testing. The annual survey is prepared in accordance with the ISO 

programme ISO9001 and IATF16949 standard of the Customer Satisfaction Survey Handling Procedure.  

We promise to provide the best service to our clients by recruiting competent management and having 

the most customer-oriented support team. In addition, we are committed to delivering shorter 

turnaround time to customers through our superior wafer probing and final testing capabilities. We also 

have a sophisticated infrastructure to support our customers' advanced equipment along with the latest 

technologies to meet their needs and achieve consistently high yields. 

FY2020 PERFORMANCE 

In 2020, we received an overall rating of "Good” from our clients, maintaining our track record from 

previous years. Our ability to meet project outcomes and contribute value to their organisations satisfied 

consumer expectations and provided them with a quality experience, thereby earning the trust they 

placed in GTCL. 

Moving ahead, GTCL aims to achieve an overall rating of "Excellent", where we deliver enhanced quality 

that provides higher satisfaction to the customers.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT  

OUR APPROACH  

GTCL sincerely believes that our employees are the foundation for the Group's long-term success. The 

efforts below illustrate GTCL's commitment to providing a safe and secure working environment in order 

to increase productivity and morale. 

GTCL ensures that our Environmental, Safety and Health (“ESH”) Policy is aligned with the ISO 

programme ISO-14001 and OHSAS 18001. We conduct regular training for all employees under the ESH 

management system to minimise workplace hazards and improve operational performance. Regular 

review and improvement in accordance with the international standards and environmental 

management systems requirements is fundamental in ensuring our business's viability in the long run.  

 

Figure 7: GTCL's Approach to Occupational Health and Safety 

Our employees are protected against reprisal, work-related hazards and dangerous situations. If 

employees are in the office, they should report the hazards to both their immediate supervisor and OHS 

officer with detailed explanations. However if they are not in the office, they should first report the 

hazards to the police prior to notifying their immediate supervisor and OHS officer.  

Besides going through regular training, employees also receive safety reminders to ensure that they are 

aware of potential risks and know how to protect themselves. Furthermore, in the event of an incident, 

the OHS officer would work with employees and their immediate supervisor to identify its root cause. 

This will ensure that similiar incidents can be prevented in the future by taking practical steps to draft 

corrective action plans. 

In 2020, no warnings and penalties were issued by the government to the Group. GTCL remains 

confident that our OHS guidelines, set within the organisation are of the highest standards.

work-related injuries.

In addition, the figure below reflects the full breakdown of GTCL's work-related hazards that posed a 

risk of high-consequence injury and the action plans to eliminate these hazards. It is imperative to the 

Group that we actively track and improve efficiency and safety standards in the workplace.

HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT  

OUR APPROACH 

AT GTCL, we believe that every employee should possess the skills and knowledge that are essential to 

sustain our business growth. The Group is committed to providing each employee with abundant training 

and development opportunities to strengthen their skills in the face of ever-changing situations. 

Our employees are a critical component to the company's success. GTCL strives to meet the needs of 

'Employee Learning and Development', ‘Organisational Growth’ and 'Company Policy' across our entire 

business operations, comprising of manufacturing, quality control, research and development, 

distribution, language training and, general management. 

We incorporate a variety of educational programmes to satisfy organisational, departmental and 

individual training needs.  With a three-pronged strategy on training, education and development, the 

Group aims to elevate individual and collective performances to achieve our long-term vision.  

All new employees will be placed under a mentorship programme to attend professional training 

according to their job scope, facilitating a smooth integration into our working environment. On top of 

designing employee training and development blueprint based on each position’s skill requirement, the 

Group also provides on-the-job training or external training when required. Furthermore, management 

courses are provided to facilitate personal growth and development in areas such as social skills, 

leadership and management skills, etc. Lastly, aligned with organisational development and strategic 

planning, we conduct specialised training courses to improve the overall human resources quality.

FY2020 PERFORMANCE 

GTCL remains committed to diversity and inclusion, with a particular focus on ensuring that all 

employees regardless of gender or job title, have access to training. In 2020, GTCL was able to retain 

a gender-balanced employee profile. 

 

Figure 11: GTCL's Employee Gender Profile 

Each GTCL employee contributes significantly to the long-term success of business performance and 

culture. Hence, continuous and comprehensive development of their performance capabilities is 

essential to drive the success of the Group. However, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, many 

training sessions were cancelled to be aligned with strict social distancing measures. Therefore, only a 

total of 9,052 training hours was recorded for this year, resulting in a significant decrease in the average 

training hours per employees compared to FY2019. The figure below captures the trend for the average 

number of training hours per employee, over the span of four years.

The figure below provides a breakdown of the training hours by employees’ gender and job position for 

FY2020.

Figure 14: GTCL’s FY2021 Target for Average Training Hours per Employee 

GTCL plans to maintain the average training hours per employee and continue to provide our employees 

with the requisite expertise and industry-specific skills for improving their competency level.

All employess should receive frequent performance assessments to help with their personal growth, 

contribute to skill management and improve human capital within the organisation. This is particularly 

true for management, who is entrusted with a great deal of responsibility in the organisation's oversight 

and operations. Both employees and their appraisers have been made aware of the performance 

assessment requirements. 

The management team in FY2020 consisted of 49 people, 43 of whom were men and 6 of whom were 

women. 100% of the overall management received monthly performance assessment, which helped the 

company meet its strategic objectives through guiding our employees in order to achieve our goals. 

Beyond the management team, all employees received reulgar performance and career development 

evaluations in FY2020, which is a significant improvement from FY2019. 

GTCL intends to continue providing monthly performance and career growth reviews for all employees 

as we progress into the coming year.
