BOARD STATEMENT 

 

Dear Shareholders, 

 

The Board is pleased to present Tiong Seng Group’s second Sustainability Report. Tiong Seng aims to 

be the trusted investment choice in the real estate and built environment through delivering 

excellence and creating value for our stakeholders. We strive to integrate sustainability into our 

operations and this report details how we identify and manage environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) issues that are important to us and our stakeholders.  

 

Board Assurance 

We believe strong sustainability governance is critical to our success. The Board plays an important 

role in the selection and review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that are 

material to us and oversees the management of the performance relating to these factors. This report 

adheres to the Singapore Exchange (SGX)-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B and references the 

internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2016). 

 

Sustainability Initiatives 

As an established contractor and property developer, we are committed to contributing to a safe, 

high quality and sustainable built environment by using innovative technologies and adopting 

sustainable practices. We recognise the potential negative impacts our operations and activities may 

have on society and the environment and seek to mitigate those impacts by implementing relevant 

measures. These measures include establishing comprehensive monitoring systems, streamlining our 

work processes, adopting efficient and sustainable construction methods as well as utilising 

sustainable materials.   

 

To reduce our environmental footprint, we encourage our employees to use recyclable materials, to 

reduce the noise generated by our activities, to use less paper in the workplace and to increase the 

utilisation of recycled water. We also work closely with our suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors 

to identify opportunities for improving our sustainability performance.  

 

We strive to contribute to local communities by supporting various meaningful initiatives. Through 

the ‘Tiong Seng Bursary’, we provide deserving and financially disadvantaged students an opportunity 

to pursue a full-time undergraduate degree programme in engineering at the Singapore Institute of 

Technology.  The bursary covers the recipient’s educational expenses and fees for educational 

activities organised by the institute. In order to improve our environmental and occupational health 

and safety standards in all our projects, we provide relevant environmental, health and safety (EHS) 

training to site staff, workers and sub-contractor’s personnel through our satellite EHS training 

centres at several of our project sites across Singapore.  

 

We strive to report on our sustainability journey as we continue to create sustainable value for our 

stakeholders in the coming years.

Performance 

2019’s Target(s) 

Energy consumption 

(electricity and diesel) 

 

154,645 kWh of 

electricity 

375,478 litres of 

diesel 

 

Electricity intensity of less than 12 kWh/m2 of 

project GFA, and

0.41 tCO2e per m2 

 

Diesel and electricity account for a large proportion of our total energy consumption, resulting in the 

production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as carbon dioxide, which can have a detrimental 

impact on the environment. Therefore, we strive to reduce our energy consumption and carbon 

footprint by implementing best practices, promoting the use of renewable energy and improving our 

energy efficiency.  

 

Dust and exhaust gas generated during the course of our business, our activities and operations pose 

a threat to the health of workers on site and compromise the air quality of surrounding areas. We also 

recognise that noise and vibration generated by tools and machines during construction activities can 

have significant health effects. Hence, various measures have been taken to manage and reduce air 

and noise pollution from our operations to safeguard the health of our workers and surrounding 

communities. In addition, we comply with the National Environment Agency (NEA)’s regulations and 

industry standards to improve air quality and to protect the environment by using instrumentation 

devices to measure and monitor defined parameters of air quality and noise emission. We seek to 

ensure that the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) reading remains below 50 and the average noise level 

is kept below 75 dB(A) during the day (7am to 7pm) and below 65 dB(A) at night (7pm to 10pm), at 

applicable sites. 

 

Our electricity consumption was 154,635 kWh in 2018, a decrease of 57% from 363,098 kWh in 2017. 

The decrease was due to a change in the projects between this year and last as well as our projects 

being at a different stage of construction. Our electricity intensity, however, increased from 0.67 kWh 

per square metre of project area in 2017 to 1.03in 2018. There was an 81% decrease in our diesel 

consumption, from 1,963,235 litres per year in 2017 to 375,478 litres in 2018 with the diesel intensity 

dropping to 2.51 litres per square metre of project area. The total GHG emissions from electricity and 

diesel have reduced from 159,380 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2017 to 65,833 

tCO2e in 2018 while the GHG emissions intensity has increased from 0.3 tCO2e per m2 in 2017 to 0.4 

tCO2e per m2 in 2018. We are pleased that we reached all our 2018 targets.

We strive to minimise our environmental footprint by ensuring that our electricity consumption 

remains below 12 kWh and our diesel consumption remains below 6 litres of diesel per m2 of GFA. 

The variation in the on-site energy intensity depends on the phase of construction and whether 

workers’ quarters are included in the construction sites. The use of electricity tends to increase 

substantially for sites that include workers’ quarters. Lower energy intensities were recorded in 2017 

and 2018 due to the fact that our construction sites had less or no workers’ quarters. We will 

continue to review the data trends and adjust our targets accordingly.

from PUB and on-site Water 

Recycling Plant (WRP) 

Water intensity 

0.33 m3/ m2 

 

High levels of water use put significant strains on water resources and result in wastewater pollution 

that could lead to the degradation of water quality. Poor water quality and water stress can 

compromise important ecosystem services and affect the quality of life of local communities.  

 

At Tiong Seng, we are committed to reducing our total water consumption by using water-saving 

features and increasing our efforts to recycle and reuse water where applicable. At our construction 

sites, NEWater (recycled water) is used in lieu of potable water and push-button water taps are 

installed in toilets and washrooms to reduce water consumption. 

 

To support the Singapore Government’s efforts to conserve water and to minimise water wastage, 

water recycling plants are installed at each of our project sites. These water recycling plants use water 

collected from rain water and site run-offs collected water is reused through a filtration system for 

construction purposes. The filtered water is also used for the cleaning of construction vehicles and 

the flushing of toilets. Excess filtered water is discharged as “clean water” into public drains.

As a result of our water conservation activities, our water consumption reduced 42% from 75,095 m3 

in 2017 to 43,617 m3 in 2018. Our water intensity increased to 0.3 m3 per square metre of project 

gross floor area in 2018, achieving the target we set for ourselves last year.  

 

In 2019, we target to keep our water consumption below 1 m3 per m2 of GFA. The variation in our 

water consumption depends on the phase of construction and whether the presence of workers’ 

quarters at the construction sites is taken into consideration. We will continue to review the data 

trends and adjust our targets accordingly.

Improper disposal of effluents, which contain substantial quantities of chemicals and nutrients 

(principally nitrogen, phosphorous, or potassium), affects water quality and has significant impacts on 

the ocean's biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems. Similarly, poor waste management can lead to air, 

water and soil pollution, which poses a threat to the environment and human health. The generation 

of excessive waste from construction activities puts huge strains on our natural resources and 

ultimately leads to environmental degradation. 

 

 

 

We strive to ensure proper management and disposal of effluents by conducting regular discharge 

water testing and complying with discharge quality standards. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) Meters 

have been installed at the water discharge points to monitor the quality of water discharged into 

public drains. The monitoring is conducted using closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage and readings 

obtained from the TSS Meters. 

 

A robust framework has been put in place to reduce, reuse and recycle the construction waste 

generated from our operations. In addition, several measures have been taken to monitor the 

quantity and composition of waste generated, which include placing different waste bins at our 

construction sites for the collection of various types of construction wastes - general construction 

waste, steel, timber, and food waste. We seek to achieve optimum waste performance targets by 

making sure that vehicles carrying waste are weighed at the work site’s weighing bridge before they 

leave for the respective disposal sites. We also work with NEA-licenced waste collectors to ensure 

that the waste generated is properly disposed of.

Further, innovative technologies and processes are used to reduce waste. Instead of using 

conventional construction methods, we adopt the Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) and 

pre-cast off-site production methods to reduce the need for wet work at our construction sites. We 

also use a new formwork system, which replaces conventional metal and timber formwork systems, in 

our construction activities.  

 

Our waste management performance is tracked on a regular basis through monthly reviews and data 

submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) each year under the Green and Gracious 

Builder Scheme.  

 

There was a decrease in our total construction waste in 2018, with general waste decreasing from 

2,155,480 kg in 2017 to 1,535,000 in 2018. Timber waste and rebar waste also decreased from 

193,920 kg and 826,400 kg in 2017, respectively, to 25,450 kg and 251,000 kg in 2018. However, 

plywood waste increased from 650 kg in 2017 to 32,600 kg in 2018. The general construction waste 

intensity increased from 3.95 kg per m2 in 2017 to 10.254 kg per m2 in 2018. There was an increase in 

the waste intensities of other materials, except for timber, which was at 0.17 kg per m2 in 2018. We 

were able to meet our 2018 targets on waste management, except for the general waste intensity 

target.

At Tiong Seng, we are committed to safeguarding the health and safety of our own employees and 

sub-contractors.   

Employee Health &amp; Safety  

 

An occupational health and safety (OHS) policy is in place to protect all employees against possible 

occupational risks and prevent accidents from happening in the workplace. Information on the OHS 

policy is provided to all employees and new employees are informed of the policy during the Quality, 

Environmental, Occupational Health &amp; Safety (QEHS) induction programme. For new employees at 

our construction sites, the First-Day Environment, Health and Safety induction programme provides 

an overview of the OHS policy implemented at Tiong Seng. The Corporate EHS team participates in 

forums and seminars on a regular basis to stay updated with the latest regulations and to re-examine 

the existing OHS policy to ensure regulatory compliance. 

 

Safety updates, initiatives and our corporate health and safety targets are shared with our employees 

during daily tool box meetings and monthly EHS committee meetings held at all project sites.  Our 

employees are encouraged to take part in safety initiatives, which include quarterly safety rewards, 

demonstrations, talks, and creating safety posters. Each year, safety awards are presented to projects 

with the best safety record. We provide our employees with OHS training relevant to their work scope 

and offer health reviews to eligible employees annually.   

 

Risk assessments and safety inspections of machines and equipment are carried out on a regular basis 

to ensure that they are safe to use and maintained in a good condition. We also conduct Construction 

Safety Audit Scoring System (ConSASS) audits every six months, assess the welfare of the workers’ 

quarters and make inspections of toilet facilities regularly.  

 

In 2018, the accident frequency rate was 0.8 accident per million man-hours, which was below the 

rate of 1.5 for the construction industry in Singapore during the same period, allowing us to meet our 

2018 target.

Sub-contractor Health &amp; Safety 

 

We strive to ensure the safety of our sub-contractors by creating a safe working environment at our 

construction sites and assessing the safety performance of our sub-contractors. 

 

Information on Tiong Seng’s Environment, Health and Safety policy and health and safety targets is 

provided to our sub-contractors before and during commencement of work. Regular dialogues are 

held to allow our sub-contractors to share any concerns or issues that they may have relating to 

health and safety. Our sub-contractors are also provided with updates and information on incidents 

reported during our daily tool box meetings and monthly EHS committee meetings at all project sites. 

 

We require all our contractors to have a minimum BizSAFELevel 3 certification and we have achieved 

our 2018 target in this respect. They are also required to participate in briefings relating to risk 

assessment and safe work procedures as well as training relevant to their work scope. We will only 

work with new contractors who are not BizSAFE Level 3-certified if they can achieve the BizSAFE Level 

3 certification within six months of the date of the new contract agreement. In addition, all 

contractors (including our second and third tier suppliers) are encouraged to attain the Biz-SAFE-STAR 

status within two years of their Level 3 certification. Also, safety inspections and audits are carried out 

every six months to ensure that machines and equipment used by sub-contractors are in proper 

working condition. Besides conducting an evaluation on each sub-contractor, we provide training to 

the members of its management team and share best safety practices with them.  

We have taken various measures to prevent workplace fatalities, which include providing additional 

training, developing management plans and carrying out a weekly inspection of our sites. We also 

adopt the Design for Safe Construction (DfSC) principles in our projects and offer various training 

courses to our employees such as the Incident Blackbox Learning.

Training &amp; Education  

At Tiong Seng, we provide various learning opportunities throughout employees’ careers to ensure 

that they develop the skills needed to perform their responsibilities. We believe that our people play 

an important role in ensuring that we achieve operational and safety excellence. Therefore, we 

continue to invest in our human capital and support employee development to meet changing 

business needs.  

Our employees receive training on Coretrade so that they are equipped with relevant skills to perform 

their jobs. They are also encouraged to obtain certifications that allow them to perform specific tasks 

or to operate particular machines. In 2018, each employee received an average of 55.4 hours of 

training.  

 

 

We offer our chargehands (i.e. worker leaders) an opportunity to learn skills such as leadership 

through the Chargehand Grooming Programme. Our scholars can develop their skills and build their

Immersion Programme, a Talent Development Programme and a Management Executive Programme.

We recognise that our operations and activities can have both positive and negative impacts on the 

local communities in which we operate. Local communities benefit from the eventual provision of 

updated facilities and housing and, at the same time, are affected by noise and other environmental 

factors caused by construction activities. Therefore, we strive to keep our negative impacts to a 

minimum and to improve our positive impacts on local communities.  

 

Safety around our sites 

 

We are committed to protecting the safety and improving the comfort of local communities around 

our sites by implementing EHS policies that ensure their welfare. A 24-hour hotline has been 

established to allow local communities to provide feedback on issues such as unsafe practices, noise 

pollution and other disturbances.

Social Responsibility 

 

Also, our presence allows us to identify the needs and concerns of local communities. We strive to 

address those needs by focusing on philanthropic activities, which include providing scholarships and 

bursaries to talented students at Ngee Ann, Nanyang and Singapore Polytechnics, BCA Academy, 

Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of 

Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). We also give donations to 

community clubs and trade organisations. In 2018, 5 SIT students who did not have the financial 

means to attend university. During the year, we gave out scholarships to 7 students and we aim to 

maintain the number of scholarships at 7 in 2019. 

We seek to build good relationships with the real estate development community and the general 

public by sharing our experiences at industry events and forums. We also aim to help increase the 

pool of talent in the construction industry by sharing our expertise. The topics shared included our 

involvement in the Lean Construction initiative led by the Ministry of Manpower and the publication 

of the HR Guidebook with the BCA.
