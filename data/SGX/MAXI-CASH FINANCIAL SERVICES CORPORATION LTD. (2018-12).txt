1. MESSAGE FROM THE CEO/BOARD STATEMENT

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present our Sustainability Report for the financial year ended

Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to the principles laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our

6.1 PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS

6.1.1 Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and monitoring of our carbon footprint can reduce operating costs, raise brand 

profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholders’ value. Our carbon footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse 

Gas (“GHG”) emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is 

emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission. We have insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and 

we do not include the GHG emissions generated by our suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of our business and operations, we have established our GHG emission efficiency index 

for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a target for GHG emission efficiency improvement 

of 23% from our FY2017 level by FY2030. Our target for GHG emission improvement is 2% per year. Although various 

business lines and operations account for different percentages of GHG emissions across the Group, they all support and have 

aligned their environmental objectives accordingly.

In FY2018, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 3.69. In comparison to our base year FY2017 index at 3.73, it is a 1.1% 

improvement towards our target by FY2030.

6.1.2 

Reduction of Paper Consumption

All our employees are encouraged to minimize paper usage at work by adhering to our paperless initiative.

We encourage all employees to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper 

consumption.

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we have established our paper consumption index for 

consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set a target for a paper consumption improvement 

of 23% from our 2017 level by FY2030. Our target for paper consumption improvement is 2% per year. Although various 

business lines and operations account for different percentage of paper consumption across the organisation, they have aligned 

their environmental objectives accordingly.

In FY2018, we consumed a total of 2,431 kg of paper, 100% of which are either Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified or 

made from KHAN-NA. Our paper consumption index stands at 11.9. In comparison to our base year FY2017 index at 14.3, it 

is a 16.8% improvement, and we are on track towards our target by FY2030.

6.2 

CARING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES

6.2.1 

Our Approach

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional development is vital to our business sustainability. 

Our goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, which is in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are 

the foundation upon which we build all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day activities.

Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and policies have been developed and established based on fair 

employment practices, with the goal of attracting, developing and retaining a motivated workforce.

6.2.2 

Employment Practices

Our employment practices focus on maximizing the strength of our employees by providing equal opportunities based on 

merits, and helping our employees to develop strength through our comprehensive training and development programme.

6.2.2.1 The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices

We have adopted the best practices in our HR management. Our HR practices are guided by the Singapore Tripartite Alliance 

for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 

National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress.

6.2.2.2 Communications

As the Group grows, effective and open communications across the Group is crucial to ensure continuous alignment of 

objectives of the employees and the organisational objectives. We have achieved this through our various communication 

sessions customized based on the target employees. Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. 

Agendas covered at these sessions are customized to the target functional scope of the managers.

6.2.2.3 Employee feedback

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedback is important for the improvement 

of overall management and operation of the Group. Through various established processes of employees’ engagement, such 

as employee’s objective setting, performance review, as well as exit interviews in the case of resignations, we will be able to 

gather valuable feedback for the continuous improvement of the Group.

In addition, the Group’s whistle-blowing policy provides a transparent channel for employees to report any concern or complaint 

regarding any improper accounting or financial matters, internal controls, disclosure of information, conflict of interest, insider 

trading, or any other areas involving fraud, corruption and misconduct of employees. The public, customers and stakeholders 

can also report possible improprieties or provide other feedbacks through the Company’s website at https://maxi-cash.com/.

6.2.2.4 Career Development and Training

We recognise that consistent and ongoing training is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, productive and motivated 

workforce.

In FY2018, each employee received an average of 19 hours of training. We recognised that the training requirements vary 

depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Each senior manager recorded an average of 29 hours of training, 

while managerial and non-managerial staffs recorded an average of 40 hours and 22 hours of training respectively. In light of 

changing business requirements and opportunities and the variety of training methodologies, we will continue to revise our 

training curriculum and programme to align with the Group’s objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our 

training approach.

In FY2018, 275 (67%) of our employees were female and 137 (33%) employees were male. In terms of management function, 

11 females (42%) and 15 males (58%) held managerial positions, while 264 females (68%) and 122 males (32%) held 

non-managerial positions. The male to female ratio of managerial and non-managerial positions were 1:1 and 1:2 respectively.

6.2.4 

Employee Benefits

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides basic employment terms 

and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, working hours, overtime, rest days and annual leave 

entitlement. We offer competitive compensation and attractive employee benefits to attract and retain the best talent in order 

to grow the Group’s business.

6.2.4.1 Retirement and Healthcare

The Group has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and regulations on pension and 

healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with applicable laws and regulations in those countries we 

operate. We provide medical coverage for employees.

priority. To ensure product safety for our customers, we have in place a set of key quality assurance processes to ensure 

compliance with regulations and international standards. We aim to totally eliminate product safety incidents so as to foster a

7. PERFORMANCE TABLE

7.1 ENERGY USAGE AND CO2 EMISSIONS

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions as measure in GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and kilowatt Hours (kWh), from 

electricity and fuel consumed. The electricity and fuel that we purchase are both from non-renewable sources.

As our business and operations grow over time, our GHG emissions and electricity consumption will vary. To ensure consistency 

and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures over time, we have created a GHG emission 

index and electricity consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity 

consumption for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the size 

of our revenue which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in t-CO2 per SGD 

million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

FY2017 was our first year of reporting the performance. For performance tracking purpose, we will

As of FY2018, the GHG emission index stands at 3.69 and the electricity consumption index stands 

at 7,638, which is a 1.1% and 0.6% improvement respectively from the previous year.

7.2 PAPER CONSUMPTION

We capture the data for paper consumption by the number of reams of paper used. One ream of paper is equivalent to 500 

sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the 

paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of paper.

As our business and operations grow over time, the paper consumption patterns will vary. We have devised a paper consumption 

index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption for the size of our activities. We normalize 

the amount of weights of paper consumed by the size of our revenue which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The 

paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per SGD million.
