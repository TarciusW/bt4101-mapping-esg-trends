collective efforts packed with intentionality will 

continue to empower us to scale new heights.

Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative 

Corporate 

social 

responsibility 

(“CSR”) 

has 

evolved over the years to become an integral 

part of the organisation. It has expanded to more 

dimensions such as corporate responsibility to 

our stakeholders – our shareholders, employees, 

customers, suppliers, sub-contractors and the 

wider community. We actively seek to play a part 

to improve the environment and contribute to the 

well-being of the communities in which we live 

and do business.

As part of our community involvement, our 

employees continue to volunteer regularly for 

various activities like Power Soccer and Annual 

Flag Day of the Muscular Dystrophy Association 

(Singapore) (“MDAS”), an organisation that the 

Group has been actively supporting since 2014. 

In 

November 

2018, 

we 

participated 

in 

fundraising for Sunburst for the second year. 

Besides showcasing young and multi-talented 

individuals and MDAS beneficiaries, Sunburst 

also featured a couple wheelchair dance and 

collaborative performances with School of the 

Arts (“SOTA”) and MDAS. Sunburst conveyed the 

message of promoting an inclusive society and to 

raise and empower a new generation of creative 

and talented people to give back to community in 

different ways.

All funds raised goes into supporting MDAS’ 

essential 

programmes 

and 

services 

for 

beneficiaries such as therapy sessions to help 

slow down muscle deterioration and transport 

subsidies for fetching beneficiaries between 

home and school in specialised vehicles. 

We also continue to promote opportunities for 

young adults with severe muscular dystrophy to 

be meaningfully employed by engaging them for 

print or web-based collaterals, through BizPower 

– a centre-based employment programme run by 

MDAS. 

The spirit of giving and touching lives as 

individuals and together as a corporate entity 

adds to creating a better future and a better world.

Legal Compliance and Corporate Governance

King Wan values corporate governance and 

legal compliance. It is of paramount importance 

that the Group abides by legal and regulatory 

requirements and is in compliance with, 

including but not limited to, the Code of Corporate 

Governance issued by Monetary Authority of 

Singapore and guidelines provided by BCA, 

Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), Singapore Civil 

Defence Force (”SCDF”), National Environmental 

Agency (”NEA”) and other relevant regulators.

For further details on Corporate Governance, 

please refer to pages 17 to 37 of the Annual Report 

2019.

Conflict of Interest Policy

The Company has set out procedures governing 

all interested persons transactions to ensure that 

they are carried out at arm’s length, on normal 

commercial terms and not be detrimental to the 

interests of the Group and our shareholders.

In FY2019, there was no identified conflict of 

interest between the Group and any interested 

person.

Customer Privacy Policy

King Wan protects the privacy and confidentiality 

of our customers’ information. We do not divulge 

or sell personal information to third parties 

for marketing or promotional purposes. All 

employees are guided by King Wan’s Code of 

Business Conduct and Ethics. 

In FY2019, there was no identified case regarding 

breach of customer privacy or loss of customer 

data.

Anti-Corruption Policy

King Wan takes a strong stand against corruption 

and bribery in the Group. We provide an 

accessible platform for employees and third 

parties to raise concerns about wrongdoings and 

improper conduct within the Group.

New employees are trained on the Code of 

Business Conduct and Ethics and briefed on the 

whistle-blowing policy.

To facilitate the reporting of suspected case 

of fraud, corruption, workplace harassment 

or 

other 

improper 

activity, 

independent 

investigations are carried out in a timely manner. 

Appropriate action will also be taken to correct 

any weaknesses in internal controls and policies 

to prevent a recurrence.

In FY2019, there were no incidents of corruption 

and no public legal cases brought against the 

organisation or its employees.

Compliance with Laws and Regulations 

The Group has put in place policies and procedures 

to ensure compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations, particularly those relating to BCA, 

MOM, SCDF and NEA. At the corporate level, we 

also ensure that we are in compliance with the 

SGX-ST Listing Rules, Securities and Futures Act 

and the Singapore Companies Act. 

Through 

constant 

monitoring, 

evaluation, 

and auditing of our OHSAS18001 certified 

Occupational 

Health 

and 

Safety 

(“OHS”) 

management system, King Wan actively ensures 

that all our activities and operations comply with 

existing regulatory requirements. Any changes 

and non-compliance with the relevant laws are 

made known to the management, and actions are 

taken to ensure compliance.

Towards ensuring continued improvement, we 

have reviewed and streamlined our processes 

to improve and tighten the procedures at 

construction sites. In addition, we are also in 

the process of implementing ISO 14001 certified 

Environmental, Health and Safety standard 

(“EHS”) management system. This system will 

supersede the existing OHSAS18001 with a more 

stringent level of health and safety protocol and 

also take into consideration the environmental 

impact of the business operation.

King Wan Corporation Limited

Environmental Initiative

At King Wan, we strive to carry out our business 

operations in a socially responsible manner and 

are committed to protecting the environment. We 

believe that the efficient use of natural resources 

such as energy and water will contribute 

positively to the Group’s sustainable growth in 

the long term.

As part of our continuous effort, we have 

installed more energy-efficient lightings and 

upgraded the lift in our office building, thereby 

reducing electricity consumption. Additionally, 

we use water-efficient fittings and fixtures in our 

corporate office to reduce water consumption, as 

well as adopt environmental friendly methods of 

waste disposal in our desilting business.

The management also strongly encourages and 

reinforces the importance of practising 3Rs (i.e. 

reduce, reuse and recycle) in our daily operations 

– the responsible usage of electricity, water and 

paper by every employee. King Wan believes that 

every small effort counts and goes a long way in 

contributing to the conservation and protection 

of the earth’s natural resources.

King Wan is a provider of M&amp;E services to 

numerous 

BCA 

Green 

Mark 

Projects. 

We 

are committed to work with our valued 

business partners to construct high quality 

developments for the communities where our 

operations are found. Central to the realisation 

of this mission is our proactive adoption 

of 

sustainable 

construction 

methods 

and 

integration of innovative technologies to enhance 

environmental performance. 

Below are some of the BCA Green Mark projects 

undertaken by King Wan during the year:

Workplace Safety and Health

Regular Health and Safety Meetings 

During our regular project meetings, arising 

health and safety matters and reports on any 

related issue or incident are prioritised and 

promptly 

highlighted. 

Attendees 

are 

also 

constantly reminded to follow recommended 

safety measures and regulations. Relevant 

findings and new policies are communicated in 

a timely manner to the rest of the project team.

Our respective Project-in-charge will also carry 

out regular site safety inspections to ensure that 

WSH standards and measures are fully observed 

at all times.

In FY2019, we have achieved zero fatality both 

at the corporate office and project sites. The 

quality of our project determines how well we 

add value to our customers. It is our priority to 

deliver innovative green designs, high standards 

of workmanship without compromising on 

functionality or price. Established in 1989, 

CONQUAS is the industry benchmark for quality 

and workmanship standards of construction 

projects in Singapore. In FY2019, with an average 

CONQUAS score of 97.3, King Wan’s score is 

significantly above the latest industry’s average 

of 88.9 obtained from BCA website.

At King Wan, we are guided by our philosophy 

“Lead the Way – Safety First” in our care for our 

employees and communities. Workplace safety 

and health (“WSH”) is of paramount importance 

to us. We firmly believe that work progress cannot 

be achieved at the expense of safety. Management 

sets the tone by defining and enforcing clear WSH 

management guidelines, fostering a safe and 

conducive working environment. 

We place great emphasis on proper installation 

methods, fire and emergency safety compliance, 

as well as maintenance of equipment and 

materials integrity. Qualified professionals such 

as engineers and technical supervisory staff are 

engaged to monitor construction progress and 

ensure that developments are built in accordance 

with building regulations and codes. All our 

employees and subcontractors are expected to 

meet King Wan’s high standards of quality, safety 

and sustainability for projects.

Health and Safety Policies

Our commitment to WSH is based on the belief 

that a good working environment not only makes 

our employees safer, but also enables them to 

focus better, enjoy high work morale, and increase 

their work productivity and efficiency. 

Safety Courses and Training Hours

We ensure that our employees are adequately 

orientated 

on 

site 

safety 

measures 

and 

regulations, in addition to being well-trained in 

WSH standards and regulations through WSH 

courses. Employees with designated job scope 

are also further assessed based on specialised 

requirements and sent for training in relevant 

courses. 

During the year, in partnership with SCDF, 

we 

conducted 

a 

Community 

Emergency 

Preparedness Programme (“CEPP”) for employees 

at our office. Other than gaining first aid skills, 

the employees also learnt about emergency, as 

well as fire safety and evacuation procedures. 

Many of our employees found the session useful 

and beneficial.

Our endeavour in achieving and maintaining 

high WSH standards sees King Wan putting 

in place a comprehensive Safety and Health 

management system, which has been certified 

in OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001 and awarded with the 

bizSAFE Star accreditation.

employee engagement and Bonding

“Teamwork makes the dreamwork”. We are 

confident that our collective will keep us 

on track to achieve our vision – delivering 

sustainable value.

For the second year running, our Recreational 

Committee continued to foster growth by 

actively engaging  our  employees  through 

our “Teams that Play Together, Stay Together” 

programme. The Zoo-mazing Race was specially 

customised to boost teamwork and challenged 

our employees’ knowledge and creativity. 

Nearly 80 employees worked together to 

complete the challenge.

Other than our teambuilding activities, we 

also engage our employees at monthly town 

hall meetings and management meetings. 

This promotes staff from various functions 

and levels to interact and get informed of any 

organization updates and operational changes. 

The employee-centric approach has helped us 

harness the diverse strengths of our employee. 

In addition, we also organized social welfare 

talks on insurance policies, CPF changes and  

Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).
