GRI INDEX

The theme of our maiden Sustainability Report is “Sustaining our Future,” which 

provides the foundation to our vision - “Nourishing Families. Enriching Lives. 

Every Day.” We need to invest in the present to sustain the future. Sustaining our 

growth is the lifeline of our business and drives it forward. Generating growth 

in a sustainable way will sustain our earnings. This means that our policies and 

practices are geared towards sustaining the land and the communities where we 

operate, and sustaining the livelihood of our stakeholders – including our growers, 

service providers, suppliers, toll packers, business partners, employees, and 

shareholders. Sustainability sets us on a path towards a more holistic and balanced 

approach towards social, environmental, and economic performance – the triple 

bottomline.

success goes hand in hand with social

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018


SGX SUSTAINABILITY

GUIDELINES

On 20 June 2016, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) 

introduced the sustainability reporting guidelines and 

required all listed companies to prepare an annual 

sustainability report as per Listing Rule 711A. The listed 

company must describe its sustainability practices 

with reference to the primary components set out in 

Listing Rule 711B on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. The 

“Sustainability Reporting Guide” (Guide) set out in 

Practice Note 7.6 of the SGX-ST Listing Rules updates the 

“Guide to Sustainability Reporting for Listed Companies” 

issued in 2011 and explains these guidelines further.

The guidelines issued were a response to the growing 

interest in sustainability from shareholders and investors 

worldwide. The annual reporting of non-ﬁ nancial 

information will enhance the visibility of SGX-listed 

companies amongst investors who seek sustainable 

investments grounded on companies’ environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) eff orts, according to

the SGX.

The highlights of the guidelines are as follows:

• 

These take eff ect on the ﬁ nancial year ending on, or 

after, 31 December 2017.

• 

Instead of a compliance statement, a Board statement 

to be included in the report describes the company’s 

sustainability actions. 

• 

The materiality principle will be applied when 

determining whether an ESG factor should be 

reported on. Factors like corruption and diversity, 

if assessed to be immaterial by companies, may 

be excluded. Companies are, however, advised 

to present information on these factors on their 

websites to satisfy stakeholder interest.

Key features of the sustainability reporting 

requirements are:

• 

Companies have to publish a sustainability 

report at least once a year, no later than ﬁ ve 

months after the end of each ﬁ nancial year.

• 

The report should describe the sustainability 

practices with reference to ﬁ ve primary 

components:

1. Material Environmental, Social, and 

Governance factors;

2. Policies, practices and performance;

3. Targets;

4. Sustainability reporting framework; and

5. The Board statement.

• 

If a company excludes a primary component, 

it must describe what it does instead with 

reasons for doing so.

• 

The sustainability report will be based on the 

principles set out in the Guide which include, 

amongst others, providing an accurate and 

balanced view of the risks and opportunities 

in a concise manner.

• 

SGX does not advocate a particular 

sustainability reporting framework. 

Companies should carefully select an 

appropriate framework for their business 

model and industry. Reports do not require 

external assurance although companies 

which have been reporting for several years 

may ﬁ nd it useful to do so.

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018


At Del Monte, we bring 

to life our vision - 

“Nourishing Families. 

Enriching Lives. Every 

Day.” We are passionate 

about bringing high-

quality, healthy and 

nutritious foods to people 

in a way that preserves 

the environment, builds 

communities, engages 

people and enables Del 

Monte Paciﬁ c Group 

to grow and ﬂ ourish. 

Improving sustainability is 

one of our strategic pillars 

supporting this vision. 

“Sustaining our Future” 

provides the foundation 

to our vision. We need 

to invest in the present 

to sustain the future. 

Sustaining our growth is 

the lifeline of our business 

and drives it forward. 

Generating growth in 

a sustainable way will 

sustain our earnings. 

This means that our 

policies and practices 

are geared towards 

sustaining the land and 

the communities where 

we operate, and sustaining 

the livelihood of our 

stakeholders – including 

our growers, service 

providers, suppliers, toll 

packers, and employees. 

Sustainability sets us on 

a path towards a more 

holistic and balanced 

approach towards social, 

environmental, and 

economic performance 

- for our people, planet 

and proﬁ t - the triple 

bottomline.

We have assessed 

important Environmental, 

Social and Governance 

(ESG) factors that 

concern our internal and 

external stakeholders, 

and have conducted an 

independent materiality 

assessment to validate 

these concerns.

We formulated our 

sustainability priorities 

within six categories - 

products, employees, 

environment, governance, 

communities and 

economy. From these six 

categories, we identiﬁ ed 

the top 30 sustainability 

priorities and engaged 

our stakeholders to 

identify the Group’s top 

10 sustainability priorities. 

We have also assessed 

emerging trends that 

might impact our business. 

The Group has embedded 

sustainability in our 

strategy to address 

material ESG factors 

and priorities. While 

one of our strategic 

pillars is to Improve 

Operational Excellence 

and Sustainability, 

sustainability also supports 

our other strategic pillars 

– Strengthen the Core, 

Expand the Product 

Portfolio, Expand Markets, 

and Strive for Commercial 

Excellence.

Our Sustainability Report 

captures the targets, 

performance, policies, 

and procedures of these 

priorities, in line with SGX 

Guidelines.

While this is the ﬁ rst 

publication of our report 

using the Global Reporting 

Initiative framework, 

sustainability is deeply 

rooted in our history:

• 

Our more than 130 

years of brand heritage 

is a testament to the 

trust in our product 

quality and portfolio 

of brands, led by Del 

Monte.

• 

Our employees across 

generations attest to 

the well-being of our 

people.

 

• 

Our more than 100 

years of experience 

in agriculture is a 

testament to the 

sustainability of the 

lands we cultivate or 

source from.

• 

Our governance 

is grounded on 

the principles of 

openness, integrity and 

accountability.

• 

Our long-term 

partnerships are a 

testimony to our 

stewardship of the 

communities where 

we operate.

• 

All these have 

sustained the growth 

of our Group across 

generations and 

geographies.

Our report is divided into 

these six areas - nurturing 

consumers, employees, 

nature, governance, 

communities and growth. 

Our Group strives to 

operate a sustainable 

business that produces 

quality products, creates 

jobs, acts with integrity, 

and contributes to the 

economic, environmental 

and social well-being of 

the local communities we 

serve. We stand by our 

commitment to grow our 

business in a manner that 

supports a healthy balance 

amongst diverse interests 

of all stakeholders – our 

consumers, customers, 

business partners, host 

communities, employees 

and their families, and our 

shareholders.

As a leading global food 

company, sustainability 

is an important part of 

the Group’s long-range 

strategic plan. Our 

Board of Directors and 

management team ensure 

that we stay on course 

in our commitment to 

“Sustaining our Future” 

– Nourishing Families. 

Enriching Lives. Every Day.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018


SUSTAINABILITY

reﬂ ects the balanced consideration of people, planet and performance.

As such, we believe the following tenets are central to our sustainability eff orts:

5. Nurturing Communities

We believe that the communities where we operate should also 

be nurtured to ensure we maintain our symbiotic relationship 

with them and our social license to operate.



6. Nurturing Growth

We continue to grow our business and the local economy to 

sustain proﬁ tability, as well as ensure we take care of our people 

and the environment.

3. Nurturing Nature

Our Group’s success is based on preserving a healthy natural 

environment. We work to ensure the lasting productivity of 

our ﬁ elds and that of our growers, and strive to ensure our 

operational standards and methods make a positive contribution 

to our environmental footprint.



2. Nurturing Employees

We are a people-driven organisation committed to the well-

being of our employees, our consumers and the communities in 

which we live and work.



1. Nurturing Consumers

For over a century, we have delivered quality products that are 

safe and nutritious. We will continue to update our product 

portfolio to bring families a broad range of healthful and tasty 

food choices.



4. Nurturing Governance

We are committed to the highest standards of corporate 

governance and support the principles of openness, integrity and 

accountability.



SUSTAINABILITY

AT THE CORE OF OUR BUSINESS

At Del Monte, sustainability is one of the Group’s strategic 

pillars and a key component supporting our vision 

“Nourishing Families. Enriching Lives. Every Day.”

We are fully committed to bringing high-quality, healthy 

and nutritious foods to people in a way that protects the 

environment, builds strong ties to our communities and 

enables our Group to grow and ﬂ ourish. 

“Our vision of a sustainable future will only materialise 

through action taken today.”

– Achim Steiner, UN Environment Programme

ﬁ rm, to ensure the independent 

process of assessment.

Our materiality assessment had the 

following objectives:

1. Identify the sustainability 

priorities, drawing on our 

knowledge of our Group and 

external sources to compile 

a list of issues speciﬁ c to the 

food industry. Based on the 

list of issues, we categorised 

30 environmental, social and 

governance priorities to frame 

our discussion with internal and 

external stakeholders.

2. Conduct a survey with internal 

stakeholders, i.e. employees, 

regarding the business impact 

of sustainability issues, which 

includes the scope and 

breadth of the issue, possible 

risk and magnitude of its 

impact, current regulatory 

and statutory regulations, and 

concerns from consumers, 

customers, communities and the 

government.

OUR APPROACH TO

SUSTAINABILITY

We believe that conducting 

business is not just for proﬁ t but 

also for the betterment of people 

and stewardship of our planet. 

Sustainability is one of the strategic 

pillars in our long-range plan as 

a testament to our commitment 

to sustain our future through our 

sustainability goals. 

Our Board of Directors ultimately 

oversees Del Monte’s sustainability 

strategy, which is developed 

together with our management 

team. The Board meets with 

management to review sustainability 

objectives and performance, which 

encompasses environmental, social 

and governance factors aff ecting the 

Group. Understanding stakeholders’ 

requirement for transparency, we 

strive to ensure that Del Monte 

adheres to the highest governance 

standards in doing business. For 

more information regarding our 

governance principles, please refer 

to our FY2018 Annual Report and 

website at www.delmontepaciﬁ c.

com/corporate-governance.

Our sustainability strategy is 

developed by a cross-functional 

team composed of the leadership 

team and experts in diff erent 

functional areas. Each functional 

team implements and manages the 

programmes to address the key 

material priorities of the Group to 

achieve the sustainability goals. This 

brings to life our vision to nourish 

families, enrich lives, every day.

MATERIALITY, STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT AND OUR 

PRIORITIES

In the prior year, we completed an 

independent materiality assessment 

process to identify and assess 

our priorities with respect to 

products, people, the environment, 

governance, business and our 

stakeholders. We engaged the 

services of an independent global 

consultant, a sustainability specialist

3. Send a similar survey to key 

external stakeholders to 

determine the issues they are 

concerned with, which they 

would like the Group to address. 

The external stakeholders 

include customers, government 

and community organisations, 

industry and trade associations, 

certiﬁ cation bodies, non-

government organisations, 

business partners, suppliers, 

academe, lending institutions and 

investors.

4. Map the issues for the Group to 

prioritise and address the most 

important issues.

Aside from these priorities, 

we also included in our report 

some emerging issues – soil 

management, talent management 

and data protection, privacy and 

cybersecurity. The Group provided 

a section on climate change 

adaptation, energy effi  ciency, 

plant breeding, Corporate Social 

Responsibility and philanthropy as 

these are essential to our operations.

REPORTING STANDARDS

We follow best practices and 

international guidelines in reporting 

our sustainability performance. The 

Group uses the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 

Reporting guidelines.

The Group has integrated the 

sustainability strategies and 

embedded them in the organisation. 

Our Quality Policy, Code of 

Conduct, Code of Business Ethics 

and Sustainability and Environmental 

Policies enable us to comply with 

the standards set by the GRI. This is 

closely monitored and reported, as 

illustrated throughout this report.

The Group’s companies are 

members of several sustainability-

related organisations. Some of the 

affi  liations of Del Monte in the United 

States include the Stewardship 

Index for Specialty Crops, the US 

Environmental Protection Agency’s 

Pesticide Environmental Stewardship 

Programme and the Canned Food 

Alliance Executive Committee. Del

remain mindful of the impact of our 

activities on the future of our planet. 

We are guided by our vision, values 

and goals to provide health and 

wellness, environmental stewardship 

and employee welfare.

SCOPE AND INCLUSIVE PERIOD

Fully acknowledging our 

responsibility towards the future, the 

Corporate Sustainability team leads 

our eff orts to increase sustainability 

advocacy amongst our stakeholders. 

Key leaders across the organisation 

have been oriented on sustainable 

business and sustainability reporting. 

Each team within the Group has set 

goals to formalise commitments 

to our overall eff ort and recognise 

individual share of accountability 

as we strive to meet varying market 

demands.

Each business unit has identiﬁ ed 

its material sustainability issues by 

location which may diff er from 

the Group’s material issues given 

the business model employed by 

the business units. As an example, 

our company in the Philippines 

does the cultivation, planting and 

harvesting of pineapples, while our 

US subsidiary uses contract growers 

to source its fruits, tomatoes and 

vegetables.

The sustainability report period is 

from May 2017 to April 2018, or 

FY2018, in line with our ﬁ nancial 

year. We have excluded our Indian 

joint venture business from this 

report since its contribution to the 

total business is not material. In the 

US, two locations closed in FY2018 

and these have been removed from 

the US data.

PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY

We produce globally competitive 

food products in the safest 

way possible. The Group has 

comprehensive quality and food 

safety policies that ensure its 

products are of the highest quality 

and meet the strictest food safety 

standards.

 

The Group’s food safety policies 

ensure that consumers understand 

our commitment to providing food 

products that conform to food 

safety standards, and to regulatory 

requirements through a food safety 

management system. We require 

our toll manufacturers to adhere to 

the same commitment in delivering 

our products to market. Preventive 

Controls Qualiﬁ ed Individual (PCQI) 

certiﬁ cates are given to all facility 

managers in the US as part of the 

Food Safety Modernisation Act. 

Facility managers of DMPI-owned 

and Toll Manufacturing facilities 

exporting to the US also have PCQI 

certiﬁ cates. 

Our agro-industrial processes are 

accredited by the world’s leading 

food certifying bodies, Global Food 

Safety Initiative (GFSI) or British 

Retail Consortium (BRC), with 88 

quality audits across our production 

facilities and toll manufacturers in 

the United States, and 24 audits in 

the Philippines. The audits were 

performed during the year by 

reputable, independent international 

auditors, business partners and 

customers. Audit results conﬁ rm 

that our processes meet or exceed 

standards for the supply and 

export of food products to certain 

countries.

Del Monte Philippines’ Quality Policy 

is committed to Total Customer 

Satisfaction in providing food 

products that meet the highest 

global standards in quality, food 

safety, hygiene and service. Our 

operations in the Philippines 

have elevated the bar on quality 

manufacturing with its Food 

Safety Systems Certiﬁ cation 

(FSSC) from Société Générale de 

Surveillance Philippines in all our 

manufacturing facilities. The Toll 

Manufacturers’ Quality Management 

Programmes plan includes FSSC 

22000 certiﬁ cation for all our 

manufacturing facilities. This is to 

ensure that all Del Monte products, 

whether produced in-house or by 

our toll manufacturers, are safe and 

of highest quality.

The key requirement for marketing 

our products worldwide, GFSI and 

FSSC, incorporate key systems – 

International Standards Organisation 

(ISO), Hazard Analysis and Critical 

Control Points (HACCP), Good 

Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 

standards - into a single system.

1. In the US, continuous 

improvement of our quality 

system is driven through 

management review, 

quality planning and quality 

improvement teams.

2. DMFI built a multi-layered 

quality system protocol that 

starts with our executive 

leadership establishing the 

Company’s quality protocol 

which is deployed to each of 

our facilities to provide guidance 

and direction, which is further 

supported by our manufacturing 

site procedures.

3. At our PET Plant in the 

Philippines, our plan is to improve 

the GMP quality scorecard by 

closing out gaps via a monthly 

technical meeting with the 

building lessor for structural 

deﬁ ciencies, monthly waste walk 

for building facilities to update 

corrections and check the 

building condition, and conduct 

personnel refresher courses.

4. Our PET Plant also plans to 

revitalise food safety trainings 

especially Hygienic Engineering 

and strengthen food safety 

management systems.

5. Del Monte in the Philippines 

regularly audits our toll 

manufacturers on compliance 

with our GMP, HACCP and 

Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) 

standards.

6. One of the major Key 

Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

of our toll manufacturers is the 

improvement of their Quality 

Scorecards year on year.

7. Our Toll Pack team strives to 

reduce consumer complaints by 

involving our toll manufacturers 

in the resolution of issues and 

improvement of our processes to 

eliminate sources of defects and 

potential complaints.

PRODUCT INNOVATION

Our Vision statement sums up what 

innovation is to Del Monte:

“We nourish families by providing 

delicious food and beverages that 

make eating healthfully eff ortless 

– anytime and anywhere. We 

build brands with quality products 

that are perfectly wholesome and 

thoughtfully prepared.” 

Innovation is at the heart of being 

able to nourish families with 

delicious food and beverages. It 

is our hope that, by doing so, we 

are able to enrich lives every day. 

Signiﬁ cant strides have been made 

in introducing new, healthy, more 

convenient and environment-

friendly products to consumers. We 

take a leadership role in meeting 

consumer preferences.

Consumers are becoming 

increasingly interested in learning 

about the ingredients in their food 

and are often looking for positive 

health properties of low-fat or 

low-sugar. This emphasis on health 

impacts and beneﬁ ts has ongoing 

implications for product design and 

sourcing.

The Group is committed to product 

innovation in coming up with new 

and reformulated products based 

on consumer trends and changing 

preferences to healthy and nutritious 

food products.

1. In the US, Del Monte invested 

US$1.8 million on research 

and development spend on 

innovation.

2. DMFI developed a set of 

guidelines that outlines the 

standards in developing new 

products which are applied to all 

new products and reformulation 

of current products. The 

guidelines are based on the 

latest USDA and FDA regulations 

along with insights from current 

scientiﬁ c literature. These are 

updated as necessary with new 

ﬁ ndings.

3. One of our new products in 2017 

was Del Monte Fruit Refreshers 

which won “Product of the 

Year” in the Healthy Snacking 

Category based on market 

research company Kantar TNS’ 

40,000-consumer votes on 

product innovation.

4. Del Monte Fruit Refreshers 

was based on the Company’s 

research which showed that 

adults were looking for snacks 

in larger sizes and new exciting 

ﬂ avours. We came up with 

larger fruit cup snacks, paired 

with citrus and tropical ﬂ avours 

in water and had 100 or fewer 

calories.

5. In the Philippines, Del Monte 

Fit ‘n Right widened its product 

range by introducing the 

Del Monte Fit ‘n Right Active 

Isotonic Drink with L-Carnitine 

to replenish body ﬂ uids during 

exercise or intense workout as 

well as help reduce body fat.

6. Other products in the beverage 

portfolio include Del Monte Juice 

and Chews, a snack-in-a-drink 

combining nata and pineapple 

with fruit juice blends, a drink 

popular amongst teens.

7. The Group’s Nice Fruit joint 

venture in frozen pineapple 

successfully launched frozen 

pineapple spears in Japan last 

June. These are produced in 

Bukidnon, Philippines. Individually 

packaged and known as 

Pineapple Stick, it is available in 

about 70% of 7-Eleven outlets 

or about 14,000 stores in Japan. 

It is positioned as an on-the-

go healthy snack placed in the 

store’s chiller section, and has 

received good feedback. With 

the Nice Fruit revolutionary 

technology, frozen pineapple, 

when thawed, has the same 

physical properties as fresh cut 

pineapple.

8. For the culinary portfolio, we 

launched the Contadina line 

consisting of olive oil, pasta, 

sauces and packaged tomatoes.

HEALTH AND NUTRITION

We are committed to health and 

nutrition and consumers trust our 

brands. We actively work to ensure 

that our brands maintain this trust 

from one generation to the next. 

We encourage consumers to 

contact us with any concerns about 

our products. We always consider 

ways to improve our products and 

customer service. Consumers can 

be assured that their feedback will be 

shared with key decision makers.

1. In the US, Del Monte is the 

ﬁ rst major US food producer 

to voluntarily adopt nutritional 

labeling on all food products.

2. Our analysis shows that almost 

all of our products contain 

positive nutrients and majority 

are considered healthy. The 

Company will continue to 

improve to increase the number 

of its healthy products.

3. We aim to have a good number 

of our products in the US provide 

at least half a cup of fruits or 

vegetables per serving, and to 

meet healthy nutrient levels 

as recommended by the FDA. 

The majority of our produce 

are picked and packed on the 

same day – 97% of it without 

preservatives.

4. The majority of our products 

in the US are low in fat and we 

carry several specialised product 

lines: organic, low-salt and 

reduced-salt, no sugar added 

and light-in-calories for those 

seeking additional health beneﬁ ts 

or following speciﬁ c dietary 

regimes.

Americans. We are also a national 

partner of the United States 

Department of Agriculture’s 

“Choose My Plate” initiative and a 

member of the Tomato Wellness 

Council.

7. In the US, we began the process 

of verifying non-genetically 

modiﬁ ed organisms (GMO) 

ingredients from suppliers and 

sourcing replacement non-GMO 

ingredients where necessary. 

8. Starting with the Company’s 

fresh pack production in 2016, all 

Del Monte tomato products as 

well as nearly 100% of Del Monte 

fruit and vegetable products 

have been converted to non-

Bisphenol A (BPA) linings.

9. Since 2017, all added ingredients 

in all Del Monte vegetables, 

single-serve fruit snacks and 

most tomato products have 

been non-GMO, representing a 

majority of its product line (154 

products in total).

10. In Asia, our nutrition platforms 

are anchored on weight 

management, heart health and 

bone health which give support

TRACEABILITY

Consumers today are increasingly 

concerned about the origins of 

their food. They want to understand 

the origin, safety, ingredients and 

sustainability of their products in 

simple language. Events relating to 

food contamination globally have 

raised consumer awareness and 

demand for better food quality and 

transparency, especially amongst 

millennials. In light of this, we aim to 

communicate with our consumers 

eff ectively to maintain their trust and 

ensure the quality and safety of our 

products. 

Part of our commitment to ensure 

that our products are safe is having 

a robust traceability programme 

in place for the Group. With 

globalisation, our products reach 

more consumers. In order to 

protect consumers’ health, the 

traceability programme allows us 

to quickly identify the origin of the 

product should an event arise - 

from its source and production to 

retailer. With this knowledge, we 

are equipped to handle consumer 

questions with conﬁ dence and in 

a timely manner. Having a reliable 

traceability programme enables 

the Group to have an eff ective 

and effi  cient process to identify a 

defective product or component 

and to execute the recall process if 

warranted.

1. The Group conducts periodic 

quality audits with our co-

manufacturers to ensure 

compliance with our standards. 

2. The number of assessments 

conducted annually for 

traceability is two mock recalls 

per facility (10 facilities in the 

US). We abide by the federal 

food safety requirements by 

maintaining a product traceability 

programme that allows us to 

track products shipped to our 

customers.

3. We have signiﬁ cantly enhanced 

this traceability programme to 

allow faster and more accurate 

traceability using electronic 

tracking of product movement. 

4. DMFI conducts extensive Risk 

Assessment/Hazard Analysis and 

incorporates actions to assure 

that the products and ingredients 

meet the highest Del Monte 

standards prior to introduction in 

the marketplace. 

5. The system is tested frequently 

and test results are used to 

drive continuous process 

improvements. 

6. Del Monte also maintains records 

that allow the Company to 

determine the source of the 

ingredients used in its products. 

7. In the Philippines, our standards 

to trace the products to its 

production date complies with 

the standards of the British Retail 

Consortium.

8. The standard applies to both 

our own facilities and our toll 

manufacturers.

9. Traceability assessments are 

conducted during certiﬁ cation 

and customer audits of our 

facility as well as our toll 

manufacturers.

PRODUCT PACKAGING

Our Group understands the need 

to have a packaging that protects 

our product, attracts consumers, 

is convenient to use, and strives to 

make a positive inﬂ uence on the 

environment.

We believe more eff orts need to be 

exerted to ensure we maintain the 

quality and safety of our products as 

well as regulate our environmental 

impact. It gives us double incentive 

to rework our product packaging in a 

more environment-friendly manner.

Our goal is to ensure the safety 

of our products as we nourish 

consumers, enrich lives, every day. 

1. DMFI provides information 

about GMOs in our products 

to consumers so that they can 

make informed choices. The 

Company provides a hotline 

in the DMFI website to enable 

customers to ask detailed 

questions and provide feedback 

on the products.

2. While the fruits, vegetables and 

tomatoes in Del Monte products 

in the US have always been non-

GMO, some added ingredients 

for sweeteners or ﬂ avourings 

have traditionally been sourced 

from genetically modiﬁ ed crops 

like corn or soybean.

3. In 2016, we began labeling most 

of our vegetables, fruit cup 

snacks and many more tomato 

products as non-GMO.

4. DMFI was the ﬁ rst manufacturer 

to work with the USDA for 

non-GMO veriﬁ cation for corn 

products to assure consumers 

about our sweet corn products.

5. We converted our products in 

the US to be non-BPA. We have 

converted 100% of our branded 

tomato products and nearly 

100% of our branded fruit and 

vegetable products to have non-

BPA lining.

6. The alternative lining material 

for our vegetable and fruit 

products is a polyester material, 

while the alternative used for 

our tomato cans is a vinyl 

lining. The linings comply with 

all FDA and European Food 

Safety Authority standards. The 

coating components are also 

compliant with the United States 

Environmental Protection Agency 

and Regulation for Registration, 

Evaluation, Authorisation, 

and Restriction of Chemicals. 

The new linings meet the 

requirements of California’s Prop 

65, ensuring that they do not 

contain phthalates or BPA.

7. In the Philippines, Del Monte 

has a convenient packaging for 

ketchups in Stand-up Pouches 

(SUP) with reclosable spout.

8. To make our products more 

accessible for consumers, we 

developed and introduced a 

low-cash outlay pack in SUP for 

our tomato and pineapple tidbits 

products.

9. Del Monte in the Philippines 

is 100% BPA-Non Intent for 

all packaging materials in the 

cannery and its toll packers.

10. We also innovated our packaging 

to make it more convenient 

for consumers. Our juices now 

come in resealable one litre-

cartons.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND 

SAFETY

We are committed to ensuring 

our employees’ health and safety. 

Providing employees with a safe 

work environment is one of our 

priorities. We value our employees 

in a way that makes life better for 

every member of the organisation. 

Moreover, ensuring the health and 

safety of our employees reduces 

costs arising from lost-time injuries 

and medical leaves. 

In the US, we strive to provide a 

workplace free of preventable 

hazards. We comply with all laws 

and regulations governing workplace 

safety and health, including the 

Occupational Safety and Health 

(OSH) Act.

In the Philippines, we consistently 

provide safety training to plantation 

and cannery employees and 

enforce the use of personal 

protective equipment required in 

performing their assigned duties and 

responsibilities.

DMPI work committees identify 

potential safety risks and hazards, 

and devise action plans to mitigate 

or avoid its occurrence. Safety 

programmes are implemented and 

process improvements are made to 

ensure workplace health and safety.

1. In the US, we apply DuPont’s 

award-winning Safety Training 

Observation Programme at every 

facility. Through this training, our 

employees are able to identify 

and communicate safe and 

unsafe conditions and acts. By 

feeling conﬁ dent and being able 

to talk to others about safety, 

our employees work together to 

prevent incidents from occurring, 

especially at our production 

facilities where there are higher 

risks, and by extension, more 

incidents.

2. In FY2018, Del Monte 

experienced a Total Incident 

Rate (TIR) of 2.62 and a severity 

rate of US$0.12 per hour worked 

– which is far below the most 

recent Bureau of Labour Statistics 

(2015) TIR of 5.2 for the fruit and 

vegetable canning industry.

3. In the Philippines, the Workplace 

Environment Monitoring 

programme also veriﬁ es the 

company’s compliance with 

the standards of the OSH of 

Department of Labour and 

Employment which includes 

measurements of workplace’s air 

quality, noise level, illumination, 

temperature, relative humidity, 

vibration and heat stress.

4. Our managers and supervisors 

are expected to keep abreast 

of the workplace’s safety laws 

and regulations that apply to 

their areas of responsibility and 

ensure compliance with these 

provisions.

5. Facilities in the Philippines have 

Emergency Response Teams and 

Fire Brigade Teams, which are 

identiﬁ ed and trained for cases of 

crises and these teams lead the 

conduct of regular Emergency 

Preparedness Drills to ensure that 

all employees are aware of what 

to do in case of emergencies and 

natural disasters.

6. Safety trainings have been 

extended to our service providers 

in both the plantation and 

cannery. 

7. We conduct periodic inspection 

of trucks and forums on safety 

and training on defensive driving

8. Our offi  ce in Manila - the 

Jose Y Campos Centre building 

- was certiﬁ ed LEED Silver by 

the USBGC for being energy and 

water effi  cient and for using safe 

materials, providing employees 

with a safe and healthy work 

environment.

9. DMPI audits the toll 

manufacturers regularly for 

compliance with all laws and 

regulations governing workplace 

safety and health, including 

Occupational Safety and Health 

Regulations.

10. Toll manufacturers in the 

Philippines provide ongoing 

safety training to all their 

employees, enforce the use of 

personal protective equipment 

required in performing 

their assigned duties and 

responsibilities and conduct 

periodic Work Environment 

Measurements for noise, 

illumination, nuisance dust 

particles and fumes to ensure 

suitability of work environment.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOUR 

STANDARDS

The Group has a Code of Conduct 

for employees and suppliers that 

strengthens our commitment to 

fundamental human rights and 

adherence to labour standards. Both 

DMFI and DMPI are members of 

the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange 

to ensure compliance in the supply 

chain.

In the US, over 64% of the 

Company’s seasonal hourly 

employees are part of unions 

that help advocate fair wages and 

working conditions.

DMFI’s philosophy holds that 

promoting diversity in the workplace 

is a means of encouraging personal 

and organisational growth and 

contribution, and further enables 

individuals and teams. Furthermore, 

workplace diversity reﬂ ects the 

changing face of the American 

workforce and population, as well 

as our customer base. In reﬂ ection 

of this, we promote managers 

irrespective of race or gender.

For the last couple of years, despite 

changes to our business, the number 

of women in senior leadership roles 

increased from 13 to 19%. Similarly, 

the number of diverse employees in 

senior leadership increased from 18 

to 24%.

In the Philippines, the Company 

performs periodic audits of contract 

manufacturers and certain direct 

suppliers. Some independent 

and unannounced audits are 

used to address quality assurance 

and compliance issues. Labour-

Management Cooperation (LMC) 

councils meet regularly to discuss 

and decide on issues aff ecting 

employees, their families, the 

Company and the communities 

where we operate.

1. Workers are paid above minimum 

wage and average rates in the 

industry, and are informed 

of the terms and conditions 

of employment prior to their 

appointment.

2. Our farm and production facilities 

employ people from surrounding 

communities and they undergo 

annual physical examinations. 

3. LMCs prepare the groundwork 

for effi  cient and swift 

negotiations between 

Union and Management, as 

manifested in the signing of two 

memorandums of agreements 

covering enhanced economic 

and social beneﬁ ts for about 55% 

of the total regular employees at 

the plantation and cannery in the 

Philippines.

4. An LMC Day enjoins plantation 

union members to celebrate 

‘wins’, including innovations 

whose beneﬁ ts have created 

beneﬁ ts beyond their own 

families. 

FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS

In the United States, employee 

beneﬁ ts are designed to provide 

employees the ability to select a 

package of coverage that meets their 

unique needs and their dependents, 

including children, spouses and 

domestic partners. DMFI off ers 

additional beneﬁ ts that help our 

employees improve their quality of 

life, including an adoption assistance 

programme, community service day 

allocation (one volunteer day time-

off  per year), product donations 

and ﬂ oating holidays (at designated 

locations).

In the Philippines, Del Monte 

complements government-

mandated privileges for all full-

time employees and qualiﬁ ed 

dependents with a broad range of 

free medical and dental services, a 

comprehensive retirement package 

and voluntary plans for providential 

and insurance beneﬁ ts.

Memorandums of agreement with 

the labour unions stipulate wage 

increases and enhancements in 

beneﬁ ts for farm and factory workers 

from year to year.

1. DMPI employee beneﬁ ts include: 

a. Savings plans

b. Life insurance

c. Employee assistance 

programmes

d. Medical, dental and vision 

insurance

e. Paid time-off  for vacation and 

holiday

f. Short and long-term disability 

insurance

2. Plantation employees live with 

their families in Group-owned 

houses and dormitories (for 

unmarried employees). 

3. Employee-organised 

cooperatives provide our workers 

with services that enhance 

economic beneﬁ ts for their 

families. Cooperative members 

enjoy annual dividends and 

patronage refunds. 

4. Children of cannery employees 

enjoy free year-round weekend 

tutorials in basketball and, as 

scheduled, other sports (tennis, 

swimming, martial arts) and 

creative skills (photography, 

theatre arts). Core values are 

introduced through learning 

exposure that helps them grow a 

strong sense of community and 

family life.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

 

Building a culture of engagement 

is a continuing journey. It requires 

commitment from everyone 

in the organisation. The Group 

involves employees in various 

activities that promote a healthy 

work-life integration. The Group’s 

commitment to engagement is a 

journey worth taking. It is one way 

we nourish our employees, enrich 

lives, every day.

3. Del Monte in the Philippines 

believes that Engagement is 

everyone’s responsibility. To 

understand the Company’s 

strengths and areas for 

improvement, we partnered with 

Gallup and conducted a survey 

which garnered 96% participation 

rate amongst the business units.

4. “Our Voice, Our Choice” survey 

allowed them to closely look 

at the critical elements that 

enable employee engagement. 

It captured employee feedback 

for the Company which 

was beneﬁ cial in creating 

an environment that fosters 

employee engagement. It also 

allowed the Company to educate 

managers on how engagement is 

created, measured, and sustained 

amongst their teams.

5. Employee Engagement is one of 

DMPI’s key priorities. This survey 

becomes the basis for action 

plans to continuously engage 

employees. The results show 

a great opportunity to further 

increase employee engagement.

6. As a way to improve employee 

communication, our Human 

Resources Department in 

the Philippines has enhanced 

our online HR Information 

System called MyHR, utilising 

technology for fast and accurate 

employment transactions. Other 

employee engagement initiatives 

by the company are the “Montee” 

stores where employees can 

purchase DMPL products at a 

discount.

7. We extensively cascaded our 

Del Monte CHOICE Values to 

employees across all levels (from

TALENT MANAGEMENT

In the United States, professional 

development is part of our 

performance system and links to 

our core values and competencies. 

DMFI management supports and 

encourages employees to participate 

in career development activities 

that will contribute to their ability 

to deliver value and ensure further 

growth and success for themselves 

and the Company.

“We choose to be excellent in 

everything we do.” This is DMPI’s 

commitment, embedded in our 

CHOICE Values, in building our 

employees’ competencies to better 

equip them for the future.

Del Monte’s “Roadmap to 

Global Competitiveness” in the 

Philippines starts with building on 

the capabilities of each employee 

on the ground with the Centre of 

Excellence on Talent Management. 

We have developed a competency 

framework for key leaders at the

OVERVIEW

The success of our business is 

intertwined with responsible 

stewardship of nature which is the 

source of our products. As such, 

we continuously improve our 

agricultural practices and oversight 

of growers, and communicate 

our Environmental Policy to 

our stakeholders as we support 

sustainable processes to enhance 

our environmental footprint.

Our Environmental Policy is 

updated periodically to reﬂ ect 

new advances in best practice and 

better serve the Group’s operating 

needs. This policy is posted in our 

facilities, communicated to facility 

management and also incorporated 

in our training for operations staff .

In the US, Del Monte connects 

consumers with our growers by 

developing information pertaining 

to where their food is picked and 

packed at the peak of ripeness. 

To instil more conﬁ dence in our 

growing practices, the Company 

provides detailed information on 

how vegetables are grown through 

new sophisticated software and 

partnership with the Stewardship 

Index of Specialty Crops (SISC) 

organisation. As an active participant 

in SISC, we analyse on-farm 

metrics with growers, track and 

monitor agricultural inputs to drive 

continuous improvement, and gain 

effi  ciencies.

Additionally, DMFI partners with a 

third party vendor, CropTrak™, to 

use their crop data management 

system to track traceability and 

sustainability metrics, and customer 

audit information. CropTrak™ 

allows us to house the data in one 

central repository to facilitate more 

dynamic communication with 

operations and partners. CropTrak™ 

also helps us improve our harvest 

and pack projections. The system 

is also a portal that can collect 

and disseminate contractual and 

educational information within 

the value chain, such as Good 

Agricultural Practices of our growers 

in planting cover crops and working 

with qualiﬁ ed agronomists.

Our crops are locally sourced and 

travel less than an average of 160 

kilometres from the ﬁ eld to the 

manufacturing gate and an average 

of 560 kilometres from distribution 

centre to retailer.

DMFI is unique compared to our 

competitors because we have our 

own dedicated agricultural Seed 

Operations Research Team. Our 

plant breeding programme uses 

the classic method of selecting 

the best plant qualities to produce 

a new generation in an outdoor 

laboratory. The team provides 

growers with majority of our seeds 

for certain crops, including the Blue 

Lake, Romano and wax beans, and 

other crops such as peas, corn and 

spinach. We are able to generate a 

higher yield for our corn and green 

beans.

In a single year, Del Monte tests over 

3,000 genetically distinct, new and 

upcoming varieties in the hope of 

identifying a better plant that we can 

grow for years to come. We grow 

and evaluate over 1,500 green beans, 

1,000 peas, and 500 corn which are 

genetically distinct.

The strongest ones are advanced 

the following year into yield, 

harvestability, and quality plots in the 

nursery, and then to successively 

larger row and ﬁ eld plots. We move 

the best few varieties from test status 

to trial status over the next two 

years, to continue to understand 

their characteristics. If the variety 

performs consistently and ﬁ lls a 

niche, we add it to the Del Monte 

Approved Variety List, scale up seed 

production to meet ﬁ eld department 

demand, and it becomes a standard 

variety used by Del Monte locations 

to produce quality Del Monte 

vegetables.

As we work to identify key 

characteristics of our plants, we keep 

the viewpoints of our customers 

and growers in mind. Their insights 

around hardiness and taste provide 

the direction for the next generation 

of our seeds and products.

Ultimately, we test for taste, harvest 

cleanliness, yield, disease resistance, 

nutrient management, and factory 

performance.

In FY2018, we grew Del Monte 

seeds that had been developed and 

grown using these processes in 

17,282 hectares of land. Of all the 

vegetables grown, 95% of beans, 

50% of corn, 25% of peas, 100% of 

lima beans, and 75% of spinach use 

Del Monte seeds. The rest of the 

seeds are selected for the same traits 

by Del Monte’s research team, but 

are not our proprietary seeds.

Our green beans are one of the 

greatest successes of our plant 

breeding programme. We have 

been able to improve the yield of 

our latest green bean variety every 

year since 1996 by understanding 

its water, nutrient timing, pest 

management, seed quality, soil type, 

plant density, timing, and overall 

growing habitat.

In the Philippines, the foundation 

of DMPI’s sustainable agriculture 

practices is effi  cient land use. 

Ecologically-minded land use 

management was carried on from 

our pioneers who started farming in 

1926. These pioneers did not clear 

forests to give way to pineapple 

ﬁ elds. Additional land acquired 

later by our pioneers was already 

cultivated for other crops.

Across over 90 years of operations, 

our land use practices are mainly 

aimed at improving plantation 

yield through ecologically friendly 

land preparation, plant disease 

management and chemical 

application, effi  cient water sourcing 

and drainage, and use of sustainable 

planting materials. 

One of the projects implemented 

to maintain DMPI’s world class 

plantation management system was 

the Drone Programme which allows 

us to monitor the condition of the 

25,000-hectare pineapple ﬁ eld in 

Bukidnon, Philippines. It captures 

pictures, including topography and 

colour, which help determine the 

health of the plants and optimise 

inputs of production. Global 

Positioning System (GPS) technology 

is also now being used to monitor 

the plantation and truck deliveries to 

ensure effi  ciency, productivity and 

safety at work.

Part of our Quality Policy in the 

Philippines is our commitment 

to environmental standards and 

sustainability objectives, statutory 

and regulatory compliance, and 

continuous improvement of our 

quality system by adhering to the 

highest ethical standards within our 

operations and in dealing with our 

business partners.

FERTILIZER AND PESTICIDE USE

In the United States, DMFI is a leader 

in introducing agricultural practices 

that minimise the use of pesticides 

and help farmers grow stronger, 

more productive crops with less 

fertilizer, water and other materials.

We help growers apply the principles 

of Integrated Pest Management 

(IPM) to minimise the amount of 

pesticides used to control insects, 

other pests and crop diseases. Del 

Monte ﬁ eld staff  and growers closely 

monitor crop conditions through 

ﬁ eld scouting, pheromone traps 

and cultural tools to help avoid 

situations that could contribute to 

pest outbreaks.

By limiting pesticide use, we reduce 

the potential for contaminated 

runoff  from ﬁ elds, protect the 

health of farm workers, prevent the 

destruction of beneﬁ cial insects 

and other ﬁ eld organisms, and 

ultimately decrease the chance that 

any pesticide residue remains on 

the crop when it is harvested and 

processed. We have participated in a 

number of IPM-related partnerships 

and initiatives to share knowledge 

and best practice.

Del Monte researchers investigate 

crop density as a way to increase 

yield per hectare while cutting 

pesticide and fertilizer use. We 

continue to explore the possibility of 

rolling out high-density techniques 

to other crops.

1. DMFI provides our growers with 

plants that are naturally resistant 

to plant diseases and insects, 

thus reducing fertilizer and 

chemical use in farms.

2. Working with our growers to 

plant the best disease-resistant 

varieties for their regions, our 

ﬁ eld staff  educate and solicit 

feedback from our farmers on 

how to best grow these plants 

and implement pest control 

and crop disease mitigation 

strategies.

3. Due to these improvements 

over the last 50 years, we have 

reduced our spraying from an 

average of 7 applications, with 

a total of 2 kilograms of active 

pesticidal ingredient, to 1.5 

applications and 90 grams of 

active ingredient. 

4. In addition, we reduced our 

application energy usage 

over 85% through such fewer 

applications.

5. Cutting down pesticide use at 

the source also helps us prevent 

pesticides from entering our 

ﬁ elds and foods. We actively 

complete laboratory tests for 

pesticide residues for over 2,000 

products each year. If we ﬁ nd any 

pesticide, we remove it from our 

products and the ﬁ elds where 

our growers cultivated them.

6. This feedback loop means we 

closely examine the impact 

that new pesticides might have 

on our products, and that we 

develop higher standards of 

growing.

7. We continue to explore the 

possibility of rolling out high-

density techniques to other 

crops.

WATER MANAGEMENT

The agricultural sector uses 70% of 

the world’s accessible freshwater 

supply, and many countries are 

reaching, or have already reached, 

their renewable water limits. With 

growing climate instability resulting 

in increasing droughts and other 

water pollution concerns, water 

scarcity is quickly becoming a top 

issue in the agriculture sector and 

governs where plants are grown, 

placing limits on productivity.

Managing water resources to 

maximise water effi  ciency, minimise 

pollution, and protect access to 

water for other users is truly a shared 

challenge for food processors.

In the United States, our growers 

use various irrigation systems to 

supplement natural rainfall and 

ensure a steady and reliable water 

supply for their crops. Water scarcity 

is a real and pressing environmental 

concern. We work with our growers 

to implement the least water-

intensive cultivation methods 

possible and encourage the use 

of more water-effi  cient irrigation 

systems and techniques to use less 

water.

Our agricultural teams work 

closely with local farmers to adopt 

agronomic measures that can

mitigate adverse consequences of 

crop agriculture on soil and water 

conservation.

Responsible farming focuses 

on sustainable crop cultivation 

and effi  cient drainage systems, 

with innovative as well as tried-

and-tested practices, including 

minimising build-up of surface water 

during heavy rain and positioning 

grass strips at strategic points to slow 

down water ﬂ ow.

We look for ways to optimise water 

use in all of our toll manufacturing 

operations, reduce water usage and 

increase water reuse and recycling.

1. In the US, Del Monte evaluates 

and prioritises water risk based 

on local availability and quality in 

areas where our plants operate, 

as well as at the farm level where 

we contract with growers.

2. From the time we plant to 

when we package the fruits and 

vegetables, water is a critical 

resource. Many of the regions 

where we grow and operate in 

are starting to experience water 

stress exacerbated by climate 

change. We see our concern 

for water scarcity reﬂ ected in 

stronger regulations and more 

calls to monitor and manage 

water use.

3. We work with our growers to 

implement the least water-

intensive cultivation methods 

possible. For instance, 98% of 

Del Monte tomato growers 

utilise drip irrigation for targeted 

application of water and fertilizer.

4. Presently, 78% of our facilities 

have high or extremely high 

water stress, so it is imperative for 

us to use water sparingly. To the 

extent possible, we capture and 

reuse water at our facilities.

5. At most of our facilities, we 

recycle the cooling water from 

our cans and use it to run our 

cooling towers. By doing so, we 

reduce the amount of fresh water 

and energy we use.

6. DMPI uses the condensate (water 

from steam and pineapple juice) 

of our evaporators and permeate 

(water from mill juice) from our 

Reverse Osmosis (RO) system for 

Ultraﬁ ltration System CIP and Ion 

Exchange Plants regeneration. 

These allow us to use less fresh 

water and avoid water treatment 

costs.

7. Of the 10 manufacturing facilities 

of DMFI, 78% of the sites in these 

regions have high or extremely 

high baseline water stress.

8. In the Philippines, our PET Plant 

Operations measure the Water 

Use Ratio (WUR), i.e. total cubic 

meter of water used per MT of 

ﬁ nished product, or the volume 

of groundwater used per volume 

of beverage product. Our Water 

Use Ratio in the PET Plant for 

FY2018 is 11.29, below the 11.87 

maximum target.

9. Our Water Conservation 

Initiatives include:

a. Improve WUR by 10% 

b. Improve RO effi  ciency from 

45% to 64%

c. RO water recovery system

d. Activation of additional 

Activated Carbon Filter tank

10. Our toll manufacturers 

have water conservation 

programmes to eliminate 

waste and reduce water usage. 

Wastewater discharges of all toll 

manufacturing lines are within 

regulatory standards. WUR 

in beverage and culinary toll 

manufacturers are monitored 

and will be reduced each year.

SOIL MANAGEMENT

In the US, soil, along with seeds, is 

the primary medium of growth of 

our products. Poor soil health can 

have impact on the environment in 

the form of poor water retention, 

increased nutrient and chemical 

runoff , and declining yields.

1. To facilitate soil management, 

DMFI asks growers to:

a. Conduct consistent soil 

sampling to manage soil 

fertility and health

b. Apply our model pesticide 

control programme

c. Use pest-resistant varieties 

where available 

d. Rotate crops to minimise 

the eff ect of soil insects and 

diseases

2. DMFI encourages our farmers to 

work with qualiﬁ ed plant and soil 

scientists, or agronomists, who 

develop innovative farm practices 

and technologies.

3. These technologies are 

harnessed and implemented to 

boost crop yields, control pests 

and weeds, and protect the 

environment. Understanding the 

agronomics of a new variety in 

a growing area is important for 

adaptation to the environment.

4. In the Philippines, landholdings 

are leased by the Company from 

lawful landowners by virtue 

of their respective ownership 

or stewardship documents 

as attested by concerned 

government agencies. 

5. DMPI installs soil conservation 

measures in pineapple ﬁ elds. 

For better soil and drainage 

management, the Crop Growing 

Units implement deepening 

of ditches and install auxiliary 

canals and silting basins specially 

designed for each ﬁ eld. 

6. Trees and shrubs are planted 

along river easement near 

pineapple ﬁ elds to prevent soil 

erosion. 

7. Our agricultural team conducts 

soil erosion studies and has 

developed a soil conservation 

manual. 

8. We also reinforce technical 

competency through continuous 

training and education on soil 

management to reduce soil 

erosion in our plantation.

9. With better fruit quality and 

greater operational effi  ciency, we 

have initiated programmes to:

a. Minimise waste and improve 

effi  ciencies in electricity and 

water consumption

b. Increase usage of recycled 

but viable packaging materials

c. Measure production 

effi  ciencies via 5S, Total 

Productive Maintenance and 

6 Sigma 

d. Enhance the health and well-

being of our workforce and 

their families

e. Ensure compliance of our 

service providers with local 

labour laws

10. The Group cooperates with 

agrarian reform beneﬁ ciaries 

and the Philippine Department 

of Agrarian Reform towards 

effi  cient implementation of 

Comprehensive Agrarian Reform 

Programme. 

11. Some of the soil conservation 

measures done in the Philippines 

are standardised basin design, 

using bamboo as check-dams 

following standard spacing and 

installation of back-slopes on 

roads.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION 

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY

We face opportunities and risks 

associated with climate change. 

Predicted impact of climate change, 

such as increased temperatures, less 

reliable water supplies, and more 

intense extreme weather events, can 

signiﬁ cantly impact our operations 

and supply chain.

DMFI’s approach to climate change 

is two-fold—we try to mitigate our 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 

and adapt our operations and supply 

chain to the potential impact of 

climate change. DMFI works with 

farmers on a variety of sustainability 

initiatives that help address climate 

change. DMFI’s plant growing 

programme helps develop drought- 

and pest-resilient seeds. The 

Company also directly partners with 

our growers through the Sustainable 

Food Alliance’s Cool Farm Tool. 

Several of our growers in Wisconsin 

and Washington piloted the tool to 

measure their GHG emissions and 

understand mitigation options for 

agricultural production.

Del Monte Foods also minimises 

carbon footprint by locating our 

processing plants close to the ﬁ elds 

where our crops are grown. The 

majority of our crops are locally 

sourced and travel an average of 

160 kilometres from the ﬁ eld to the 

manufacturing gate, and an average 

of 560 kilometres from distribution 

centre to retailer.

In the Philippines, we also closely 

monitor our carbon footprint. While 

most manufacturing companies, 

including food companies, are 

carbon positive, meaning they 

emit more carbon dioxide into the 

atmosphere than they sequester or 

absorb, the carbon footprint of Del 

Monte Philippines, Inc is negative. 

DMPI is the largest producer of 

pineapples in the country and its vast 

25,000-hectare pineapple plantation 

and forest areas reduce the amount 

of carbon dioxide, off setting any 

emissions in the atmosphere. There 

are not many companies that are 

carbon negative or even carbon 

neutral. Less carbon emissions are 

better for the environment. DMPI, a 

leading manufacturer of food and 

beverages, is uniquely positioned 

amongst food companies to help 

mitigate climate change. DMPI plants 

various timber trees in plantation 

camps, company grounds and 

facilities. Bamboos are planted along 

ﬁ eld boundaries and non-arable 

land.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018


The Group continually assesses 

our investment opportunities in 

renewable energy solutions in 

each of our facilities. A number of 

renewable energy projects have 

been implemented across our 

facilities in the Philippines and United 

States.

As early as 2009, DMFI installed 

6,400 solar panels covering over 37 

square kilometres and producing 1.8 

million square kwh which amounts 

to more than 8% of total electricity 

requirements during non-pack 

season at our primary tomato 

production facility in Hanford, 

California. The solar panel installation 

at our Hanford facility has enabled 

us to become a member of the 

Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA) Green Power Programme.

In the Philippines, Del Monte 

embarked on a renewable energy 

project that produces biogas using 

cannery wastewater. The waste-to-

energy facility generates 2.8 MW 

of electricity. More signiﬁ cantly, 

cleansed water discharged at 

coastal waters of Macajalar Bay has 

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) 

levels below government mandated 

levels. The waste-to-energy facility 

supports our Company’s long-range 

plan for increased production which 

ensures 100% wastewater treatment, 

and serves as a shield against 

unstable power supply and power 

cost increases.

We will continue to seek out 

energy reduction opportunities 

across all our facilities and invest 

in improvements that collectively 

reduce our air emissions, including 

GHG and our operating costs. 

1. In the US, Del Monte received 

the Greenhouse Reduction 

Award from the California 

Manufacturers and Technology 

Association and the Industrial 

Environmental Association. 

2. As part of DMFI’s ongoing 

continuous improvement eff orts, 

our Modesto plant installed 

a combined heat and power 

system, selective catalytic 

reduction unit, condensing 

economiser and backpressure 

turbine generator to its boiler 

system that cut natural gas use 

by 20%.

3. DMFI has a company-wide 

programme dedicated to 

implementing condensing 

economisers to improve heat 

recovery and steam system 

effi  ciency.

At least 50% of our facilities utilise 

this technology and we continue 

to expand this programme across 

our other facilities.

4. Six facilities installed condensing 

boiler stack economisers to 

use hot exhaust gases from 

boilers to preheat water in a 

heat-exchanger system which 

improves the operating effi  ciency 

of the boilers by up to 12%, 

reducing the amount of natural 

gas needed to run the boilers by 

the same percentage.

5. At DMFI, we track total network 

miles as a way to determine 

the success of our eff orts 

to reduce the distance our 

ﬁ nished products travel between 

processing plant and store.

Since 2015, we have eliminated 

2.3 million miles or 3.7 million 

kilometres (the equivalent of 

approximately 1,476,310 litres of 

diesel fuel) from our distribution

network through a variety of 

initiatives.

6. Del Monte in the Philippines 

embarked on a renewable energy 

project that produces biogas 

using cannery wastewater.

a. This plant complements the 

job done by an equally eco-

eff ective but power-intensive 

aerobic treatment plant.

b. This plant highlights 

our commitment to 

environmental stewardship 

on reduction of our GHG in 

compliance with the Clean 

Air Act of the government - 

recycling while enhancing 

our business competitiveness 

through reduced energy 

costs.

c. This plant reduces the yearly 

energy cost of the company 

by approximately 40 million 

pesos because it is 20% 

cheaper than the grid which 

mostly relies on coal-ﬁ red 

plants.

7. In the Philippines, we received 

the Outstanding Award in 

the Don Emilio Abello Energy 

Effi  ency Awards in 2017.

8. By using the waste-to-energy 

facility in the Philippines, we have 

reduced 29% of the cannery’s 

power cost per kwh.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

In the United States, we are 

benchmarking our waste 

management practices and 

speciﬁ cally comparing landﬁ lling 

to recycling rates to ensure that we 

are managing our waste streams in 

the most effi  cient manner possible. 

We instituted a “Ner0 (Near Zero) 

Landﬁ ll” policy where we aim to 

divert up to 98% from reaching the 

landﬁ ll based on the Environmental 

Protection Agency’s Waste 

Reduction Hierarchy.

In the Philippines, we are also 

committed to sustainable 

waste management across our 

operations. We aim to reduce the 

overall consumption and usage 

of raw materials in all facets of 

our operation, including toll 

manufacturers. In line with this, we 

encourage the reuse of materials in 

all areas of operation. We promote 

the concept of recycling and 

the beneﬁ ts of utilising recycled 

materials. When disposal is the only 

option, we seek to dispose materials 

in an environmentally safe and 

responsible manner. We understand 

that the correct handling, storage 

and disposal of waste materials 

is essential to comply with 

environmental regulations and 

pollution prevention.

Our pineapple pulp waste disposal 

system, a pioneering eff ort which 

started in the 1950s, converts a by-

product of the cannery into feed for 

our cattle farm at the plantation. This 

helps us reduce waste and cut costs. 

1. For over four years, we have 

been actively involved in 

the Food Waste Reduction 

Alliance which is a collaborative 

eff ort between the Grocery 

Manufacturers Association, Food 

Marketing Institute and National 

Restaurant Association.

2. Our Walnut Creek Research 

Centre (WCRC) in California 

received a “RecycleSmart” Award 

from the Contra Costa Solid 

Waste Authority for our food 

waste recovery eff orts.

3. The WCRC diverts the food 

and packaging materials of 

unused food through the 

manual opening of pallets of 

non-donatable packaged food, 

recycles the container and sends 

the food to compost for energy 

as part of a local restaurant 

programme, Food Recycling 

Project.

4. Our WCRC is also certiﬁ ed 

as a Bay Area Green Business 

due to its eff orts to conserve 

water, energy and waste, 

implement eco-friendly materials 

and engage employees in 

conservation behaviour best 

practices.

5. We operate effl  uent treatment 

plants that treat wastewater 

discharged from our agro-

industrial facilities.

6. Our high-ﬁ ltration extraction 

system processes excess juice 

into pineapple concentrate and 

syrup, signiﬁ cantly reducing 

volume of wastewater.

7. Plantation-based families share 

in our total conservation eff ort 

as they segregate domestic solid 

waste right in their own homes. 

Recyclable materials collected 

from households are sold to fund 

community projects.

8. Awards received in Pollution 

Control Association in the 

Philippines include The 

Outstanding Pollution Control 

Offi  cer Award and 1st Runner-up 

for Mother Nature Award.

9. Our PET Plant Operation in the 

Philippines implements a solid 

waste segregation programme 

in order to capture recyclable 

wastes and sell them as scrap 

materials.

10. All toll manufacturers in the 

Philippines practice waste 

segregation, and waste 

management is part of new 

employees’ training of our toll 

manufacturers. DMPI ensures 

that all toll manufacturers comply 

with water and smoke discharge 

regulations. 

BIODIVERSITY AND THE 

ENVIRONMENT

Under our sustainability framework, 

we have signiﬁ cantly enhanced our 

stakeholder advocacy programme 

for environmental conservation. In 

the Philippines, our carbon footprint 

remains carbon-negative. However, 

we continue to undertake many 

initiatives during the year to reduce 

process residues, strengthen energy 

conservation in all worksites and 

plantation homes, and explore more 

effi  cient energy sources.

1. Del Monte Foods and its leading 

shippers have successfully 

completed 2016 emissions 

reporting with the US 

Environmental Protection Agency 

SmartWay Transport Partnership.

2. DMFI piloted the Sustainable 

Food Alliance’s Cool Farm Tool in 

Wisconsin and Washington.

The Board of Directors and 

Management are committed to use 

their best endeavours to align the 

Group’s governance framework with 

the recommendations of the revised 

Code of Corporate Governance 

issued on 6 August 2018 by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore, 

the Singapore Governance and 

Transparency Index, the ASEAN 

Corporate Governance Scorecard 

and the SEC’s Philippine Code of 

Corporate Governance for Publicly 

Listed Companies.

The Corporate Governance 

Manual of the Group contains the 

framework of principles, guidelines, 

policies and terms of references 

that govern the performance of 

the Board and Management and 

their responsibilities that serve 

both corporate objectives and the 

long-term interests of the Group’s 

shareholders and other stakeholders. 

The Manual contains guidelines 

that are intended to prevent any 

conﬂ ict of interest on the part of the 

Company’s directors and executives.

The Company’s Interested Person 

Transactions (IPT) policy and 

manual prescribe the review and 

monitoring procedures and approval 

requirements for any transaction 

of the Group and its subsidiaries 

with any interested person such 

as a director, the Chief Executive 

Offi  cer, any controlling shareholder 

or associate of these persons. The 

policy and manual recognise and 

guard against the potential undue 

inﬂ uence that interested persons 

may have on the Group especially 

with respect to entering into 

transactions that may not be in the 

best interest of the Company or 

minority shareholders.

In order to protect the Group against 

any conﬂ ict of interest at any level, 

all employees are required to provide 

relevant information on relationship 

that they may have with any of 

their employer’s suppliers, service 

providers, counterparties, other 

employees or other circumstances 

that give rise or could give rise to a 

conﬂ ict of interest.

Moreover, the Group implements 

a Securities Dealings Policy which 

prohibits certain designated persons 

within the Company to deal in 

the Company’s securities while in 

possession of unpublished material, 

price-sensitive information or to 

provide such information to others. 

This policy should eff ectively guard 

against insider trading that prejudices 

minority shareholders and the 

investing public.

The Group implements a 

Whistleblower Policy that aims to 

deter and uncover any corrupt, 

illegal, unethical, fraudulent or other 

conduct detrimental to its interests 

that may be committed by offi  cers 

and employees as well as third 

parties or any other persons such as 

suppliers and contractors.

Importantly, pursuant to the Group’s 

Code of Business Ethics, it has a 

stringent policy against fraud and 

corruption. Supplementing the 

Code of Business Ethics are the 

Employee Code of Conduct and 

Supplier Code of Conduct which 

help employees and suppliers 

navigate several decisions and 

transactions they make and enter 

into every day. Adherence to these 

codes helps employees and business 

partners to have sustainable business 

relationships.

Pursuant to these codes, the Group 

prohibits any form of corruption 

by its employees and suppliers. 

Any solicitation or off ering of 

gifts, payments or commissions 

by Company employees and their 

families, or by suppliers and their 

representatives, in exchange for 

business or for personal gain is 

strictly prohibited and employees 

are expected to report any such 

violations or suspected violations.

DMFI’s Anti-Corruption programme 

aligns with that prescribed by the US 

Department of Justice, which is a 

hallmark of an eff ective compliance 

programme. Anti-Corruption 

training is provided every two years 

to approximately 100 offi  cers and 

employees at Del Monte and its 

subsidiaries. The Anti-Corruption 

Policy includes procedures to 

address high-risk transactions such 

as:

a. International Gifts and Hospitality

b. Travel and Lodging for 

Government Offi  cials

c. Review and Approval of any 

Facilitating Payments

d. Retention of Intermediaries and 

Consultants

e. Reviews of Proposed Charitable 

and Political Donations

f. Financial and Accounting 

Requirements

DMFI’s Anti-Corruption procedures 

require employees to follow a 

speciﬁ c due diligence process 

and obtain prior written approval 

from the Legal Department before 

retaining any consultant, agent 

or other third party who may 

reasonably be expected to interact 

with any foreign government offi  cial 

on behalf of Del Monte.

3. DMFI periodically performs 

a third-party risk assessment 

and evaluates controls and 

procedures for the Company’s 

highest risk third parties. Criteria 

used for evaluating risk are:

a. the country where third 

parties are based and the 

associated Corruption 

Perception Index of that 

country;

b. whether transactions are 

material or not;

c. and the nature of the business 

partner relationship.

4. DMFI has an Employee Code of 

Conduct and Supplier Code of

5. Del Monte in the Philippines 

has a Code of Business Ethics 

which directors, management 

and all employees abide by. 

All employees are required to 

provide information on related 

party and conﬂ ict of interest, 

which is updated annually.

6. Internal audits are periodically 

performed to assess corporate, 

facility and subsidiary processes 

and controls to ensure 

compliance with the foregoing 

policies and to mitigate risk of 

breaches, fraud, ﬁ nancial and 

reputational damage.

DATA PROTECTION, PRIVACY AND 

CYBERSECURITY

In this Information Age where data 

is considered the new currency, 

data protection, privacy, and 

cybersecurity have never been 

more important. As data processing 

evolves and companies increase 

their reliance on big data, the risks of 

data breaches and potential misuse 

of personal and sensitive information 

have become more apparent and, in 

many cases, have given rise to new 

laws and regulations worldwide.

In response to this challenge, 

the Group has strengthened 

its commitment to protect the 

personal data of its various 

stakeholders, including its 

employees, shareholders, customers, 

contractors, business partners and 

suppliers. The Group has adopted 

a Data Privacy Manual which 

codiﬁ es the Group’s commitment to 

ensuring the free ﬂ ow of information 

to promote innovation and growth, 

and for the proper management 

of its businesses, while at the same 

time ensuring that the subject’s 

fundamental right to privacy is 

respected. 

With evolving privacy laws and 

regulations, the Group needs 

to more carefully navigate the 

changing legal environment 

while remaining steadfast in its 

commitment to data privacy. The 

same applies to cybersecurity laws 

and regulations which have also 

become increasingly more complex. 

Companies can be subjected to 

ﬁ nes, injunctions, government audits 

and, in more serious cases, criminal 

liability.

This has been exacerbated by 

breaches in security against major 

companies worldwide, thus, 

heightening the need to strengthen 

our cybersecurity against such 

attacks. One signiﬁ cant risk of such 

breaches in security is the negative 

eff ect of media attention which may 

result in loss of consumer trust and 

conﬁ dence in the Group, thereby 

resulting to consumers being less 

willing to share their data with the 

Group, including data which could 

have been valuable in making 

informed business decisions and 

improved customer off erings.

Our Group is committed to 

respecting and protecting the 

privacy of individuals who visit our 

websites. We do not disclose any 

of the users’ personal data except 

as required by law or regulations, 

and we process their personal 

data exclusively for the purpose of 

pursuing the relationship with them 

as declared in the respective privacy 

policies of our websites.

With the increasing global incidence 

of cyberattacks on companies’ 

servers and websites, we have 

committed to strengthen and 

improve the security of the Group’s 

systems.

1. The Group has implemented an 

Enterprise Resource Planning 

system, Systems, Applications 

and Products (SAP), in the US 

and outsourced its ﬁ nance 

and accounting functions to a 

reputable global service provider 

in the Philippines.

2. Given the new systems and 

processes involved, there are 

risks to timely and accurate 

processing of documents, 

monitoring of expenditures, 

along with the change of service 

provider and decision-making 

associated with the steady ﬂ ow 

of detailed quality information.

3. Refocusing IT support to 

eff ectively manage the project 

implementation which includes 

prioritising SAP enhancements, 

aligning key business processes 

with functional groups, and 

putting in place a transition plan.

4. The Group develops and 

implements measures to counter 

and eliminate cyberattacks from 

outside sources.

5. We have engaged a third party to 

audit our systems and mitigate 

risks relating to data privacy and 

cyberattacks.

6. Recognising that IT Assets are 

valuable and vital to support 

tactical business functions, 

the Group is currently in the 

process of revising its existing 

Information Security Policy to 

ensure that eff ective protection 

of information is communicated 

in a clear and consistent manner.

OVERVIEW

The Del Monte family prides itself in 

giving back to the community. This 

has become our tradition since the 

ﬁ rst pineapple ﬁ elds were planted 

in the 1920’s. To this day, Del Monte 

employees keep this tradition as 

we visit various communities. The 

Group’s employees volunteer their 

time to help make lives better for the 

less fortunate.

As a responsible corporate citizen, 

the Group continues to contribute 

to the development and upliftment 

of the quality of life in communities 

where we operate.

During the fall of 2017, DMFI quickly 

acted to deliver over 453,600 

kilograms of food for Hurricane 

Harvey rescue eff orts in Texas, 

Louisiana and Puerto Rico, as well as 

ﬁ re recovery eff orts in California and 

to earthquake responders in Mexico. 

Additionally, each US-based 

manufacturing facility donates to 

local food banks on a regular basis. 

In 2017, their eff orts resulted in 

over 3.6 million kilograms of food 

donated to food banks near where 

they operate. DMFI corporate 

offi  ces in Walnut Creek, California; 

Rogers, Arkansas; and Pittsburgh, 

Pennsylvania also coordinated 

volunteer eff orts to help pack 

donatable goods for local families in 

need near the offi  ces. 

COMMUNITY INVESTMENT 

Our corporate giving programme 

reﬂ ects our values and we share 

these with the communities in 

which we operate. At Del Monte, we 

have a can-do spirit and we believe 

in using our quality products to 

change lives and make a real impact 

in our communities. Through this 

approach, we identify and support 

local and national organisations that 

make a diff erence.

1. As part of our “Farm2Family” 

Corporate Giving programme, 

we strive to contribute to 

organisations that focus on farm 

advocacy, feeding those in need, 

environmental stewardship, 

disaster relief, education, youth 

activities, family care, and healthy 

living through ﬁ nancial gifts, as 

well as donating food to our 

communities where we can have 

the most impact.

2. Beyond hunger relief, our 

programmes also reduce waste 

such as our Brite Recovery 

Programme with Feeding 

America. Sometimes there are 

slight imperfections in fruits or 

cans during the manufacturing 

and labeling process.

3. Another source of waste 

typically starts at the ﬁ eld itself. 

When excess food is grown 

and cannot be sold, it is plowed 

under. Through a partnership 

led by the Wisconsin Institute for 

Sustainable Agriculture called 

Field to Foodbank, excess food 

is contributed to those in need 

through a collaboration between 

growers, manufacturers, and 

truckers.

4. To manage the challenge of 

supporting local food bank 

inventory needs, the unused 

fresh food is canned, helping 

to extend the shelf life and lock 

in the nutritional beneﬁ ts. This 

system relies on multiple layers 

of generosity from the donation 

of the seeds, land, labour, cans, 

and processing.

5. Del Monte is proud to have been 

part of Field to Foodbank, in 

partnership with our growers, 

since its inception in 2008. 

During that inaugural year, Del 

Monte processed 3,000 cases, 

providing a robust proof of 

concept.

6. Finally, when disaster strikes, 

a quick reaction is key to help 

those aff ected. While the roads 

are still impassable at times, 

we ship our nutritious food to 

communities in need. We work 

with the American Red Cross 

and Feeding America to respond 

in real-time with pre-approved 

in-kind food donations for large-

scale disasters, especially those 

aff ecting farms.

7. When hurricanes severely 

damaged parts of Texas, 

Florida, and Puerto Rico in 

2017, Del Monte responded 

with 18 truckloads of fruits and 

vegetables equal to over 1 million 

pounds of food distributed 

in under three weeks to the 

aff ected regions.

COMMUNITY HEALTH AND 

WELLNESS

Del Monte Foundation, Inc, a non-

stock and non-proﬁ t organisation 

in the Philippines, spearheads our 

eff orts as we expand our reach in the 

local community. The Foundation 

employs a framework for identifying 

and selecting community projects, 

in coordination with the DMPI 

Plantation and Cannery teams. 

The Foundation’s mission is to 

raise the level of global health 

and wellness by bringing greater 

awareness on health, nutrition and 

food safety to our host communities. 

Through the Del Monte Foundation, 

we help address various community 

concerns on sanitation, health and 

wellness.

1. The Foundation supports Smile 

Train, a programme that provides 

free surgery to indigent children 

with cleft lip.

LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMMES

Our Community Education Centre 

has offi  cial accreditation from the 

Philippine Technical Education 

and Skills Development Authority 

(TESDA) highlighting public-private 

sector cooperation for community 

education. Community-based skills 

trainings are also conducted to 

provide greater and easier access to 

technical education for the out-

of-school youth and unemployed 

heads of families. The skills learned 

are used by the beneﬁ ciaries for 

employment or self-employment to 

augment their family’s income.

1. Free technical skills training 

courses are conducted in towns 

and cities in the Philippines. 

Training graduates take national 

certiﬁ cation exams given by 

TESDA and are assisted by the 

government’s employment offi  ce 

for job placement. Others opt 

to be self-employed and are 

given start-up assistance by the 

Department of Social Welfare 

and Development or Local 

Government Units (LGUs).

2. The Del Monte Foundation 

Centre in Camp Phillips, 

Bukidnon, Philippines continues 

to off er technical and vocational 

training on shielded metal 

arc welding, bread and pastry 

production and basic driving.

3. Del Monte Foundation 

implements its Home Care 

Education, a 5-month 

programme that teaches women 

proper nutrition, preventive 

health, family planning, herbal 

remedies, emergency care and 

livelihood skills, amongst others. 

4. The Foundation initiates 

and supports new trainings 

through partnerships with 

government agencies and private 

organisations.

5. The Foundation has introduced 

fruit preserve making in 

cooperation with the Plantation 

Supervisors’ Co-op and the 

Department of Trade and 

Industry to utilise excess 

supply of papaya. This provides 

livelihood opportunities for 

housewives in the neighbouring 

localities.

EDUCATION, SCHOLARSHIPS AND 

YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

Through the Del Monte Foundation, 

gifted children earn quality 

education from primary levels up to 

post-graduate studies through our 

academic, grants-in-aid and sports 

scholarships. A scholar is supported 

in each of the communities where 

DMPI has operations.

Aside from scholarships, we 

work closely with the community 

to harness the potential of the 

youth to lead and transform their 

communities into self-suffi  cient 

units for nation-building.

1. Consistent with our commitment 

to help the national government 

address the shortage in school 

facilities, i.e. classrooms and 

chairs, the Foundation undertook 

the construction of 2 classrooms 

in San Roque Elementary School 

and Lindaban Elementary School 

in two towns in Bukidnon, 

Philippines.

2. Public schools in 5 towns in 

the Philippines beneﬁ tted from 

the assistance extended by the 

Foundation during the annual 

school brigade. Materials to help 

restore classroom buildings and 

facilities were donated to make 

them functional and ready for the 

opening of the new school year.

3. Wooden pallets from DMPI’s 

cannery were also donated to 

the LGUs of two localities from 

which they produced additional 

school chairs. The Foundation 

promotes child development 

through the material assistance it 

extends to institutions that cater 

to the needs of young children. 

It donates various materials 

designed to help develop the 

motor, visual-learning and 

creative skills of pre-school 

children in 17 public elementary 

schools and 6 day-care centres.

We are a global branded food

caters to today’s consumer 

needs for premium quality, 

healthy products.

OVERVIEW

The economic impact of Del Monte 

Paciﬁ c Group beneﬁ ts more than our 

5,600 regular employees. In addition, 

we have engaged service providers 

in all areas of our operations.

In the United States, Del Monte 

Foods is one of the largest 

producers, distributors and 

marketers of premium quality, 

branded food products for the 

US retail market. DMFI contracted 

with over 1,000 farmers across 

North America which supplied 

over 900,000 tonnes of produce 

in FY2018. 100% of the tomatoes, 

99% of the vegetables and about 

70% of the fruits we produce are 

grown in the US. Our relationships 

with farmers extend more than 

three generations. The fruits and 

vegetables are contractually grown 

on farms that collectively span over 

28,300 hectares of land. Some Del 

Monte fruit growers include farm 

families that have produced for Del 

Monte for over 70 years. Our growth 

has a broader implication for farms 

across the United States.

Our pineapple plantation in the 

Philippines encompasses 10 

municipalities in Bukidnon and 

seven towns in Misamis Oriental, 

Mindanao. We engage with over 

50 supplier partners which provide 

various goods and services to the 

Company. An estimated 15,000 

families or approximately 75,000 

individuals directly or indirectly 

depend on the Company in southern 

Philippines.

Overall, our presence has 

immensely contributed to the 

region’s economic growth, creating 

a multiplier eff ect on the local 

economy by fueling local business,

OUR PERFORMANCE

For FY2018, the Group generated 

sales of US$2.2 billion, down 2.5% 

from prior year on higher Philippines 

and S&amp;W Asia sales off set by lower 

USA and Europe sales. The US 

business accounted for US$1.7 

billion or over 75% of total sales. 

The Philippine business delivered 

record sales of US$333.8 million, up 

7% in peso terms. S&amp;W business in 

Asia generated record sales as well 

of US$106.1 million, up 6% from 

FY2017.

DMFI increased its market share 

in the US across key categories in 

retail, i.e. canned vegetables, canned 

fruits and fruit cup snacks driven 

by compelling innovations, strong 

execution against fundamentals 

at retail, and sustained marketing 

investment to support its brands. 

DMPI also maintained its dominant 

market position in the Philippines in 

categories it competes in.

DMPL generated a gross proﬁ t of 

US$432.5 million, lower by 13% 

versus prior year, as gross margin 

decreased to 19.7% from 22% last 

year. The Company generated an 

EBITDA of US$102.3 million, lower 

by 47.3%. Half of the decline was 

attributed to one-off  expenses 

amounting to US$29.1 million after 

deducting one-off  gains. Without 

the one-off  expenses, the Group’s 

EBITDA would have been US$165.0 

million, down 22% versus FY2017.

The Group generated a net loss 

of US$36.5 million for the full year 

FY2018, unfavourable versus prior 

year’s net income of US$24.4 million 

mainly due to one-off  expenses of 

US$48.5 million post-tax. Excluding 

one-off  expenses, the Group’s net 

income would have been US$12.0 

million, lower versus the recurring 

net income last year of US$45.5 

million mainly due to higher 

marketing investment in the USA 

to reinvigorate the business in line 

with the Group’s long-range plan,

coupled with lower export sales and 

signiﬁ cantly reduced pineapple juice 

concentrate pricing.

In FY2018, the Group focused on 

three key areas – deleveraging 

the balance sheet, strengthening 

our core business and innovating 

products and processes.

1. The Group reduced its net debt 

at the end of FY2018 to US$1.4 

billion, much lower than US$1.7 

billion at the end of the prior 

year. We ended FY2018 with a 

net debt to equity ratio of 2.4x, 

a reduction from 2.9x in FY2017, 

and more signiﬁ cantly, 7.5x 

four years ago post-acquisition 

by executing the following 

initiatives:

a. The Group raised about 

US$450 million of equity for 

debt repayment – US$300 

million in April and December 

2017 by issuing the ﬁ rst 

US Dollar denominated 

Preference Shares listed 

on the Philippine Stock 

Exchange, and US$150 

million of capital through a 

Rights Issue in 2015.

b. DMPL purchased US$126 

million of loans in the USA 

that yielded signiﬁ cant 

principal and interest savings. 

These loans had been trading 

at substantial discount to par 

value in the secondary market 

and are the highest interest-

bearing credit facility of the 

Group.

c. The Group signiﬁ cantly 

improved its operating cash 

ﬂ ow to US$322.9 million in 

FY2018 from US$187.1 million 

in the prior year, primarily 

by reducing inventory in the 

USA.

2. With our US business generating 

75% of Group sales, we 

strengthened our US leadership 

team with the appointment of a 

new Del Monte Foods CEO, Chief 

Marketing Offi  cer, and Heads of 

Operations and Foodservice.

3. Under the new DMFI leadership 

team, the Company has become 

more market-driven, innovative 

and aligned with consumer 

preferences, supported by a 

strong operations team. 

4. We divested the non-performing 

Sager Creek vegetable business 

in September 2017, closed its 

factory, and also shut down 

another plant in Indiana.

going beyond traditional, 

commoditised off erings.

7. DMPL entered a new category 

of frozen pineapple using Nice 

Fruit’s breakthrough technology 

which allows fruits and 

vegetables to be frozen up to 

three years, and, once thawed, 

retain their original properties just 

like fresh.

8. Our innovation in the Philippines 

will go beyond focusing on 

beverage, and will include more 

new product launches in fruits 

and culinary, focusing on value-

9. Innovation goes beyond 

launching new products, includes 

our processes, and cuts across 

all functions of our Company – 

in agriculture, production and 

supply chain, marketing and 

sales, digital, support functions 

and renewable energy.

10. The Group donated US$1.3

projects such as scholarship 

grants, technical training to 

unemployed community

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018


Group conducts business with all 

customers on the basis of integrity, 

mutual interest and fairness. The 

Group prohibits the practice of 

forced and child labour.

In the United States, DMFI has a 

Supplier Code of Conduct that 

applies to any entity providing goods 

or services, including suppliers 

and subcontractors. The objective 

is for suppliers to practice and 

uphold ethical business standards. 

Del Monte’s Supplier Diversity 

Programme enables small and 

diverse businesses to be considered 

fairly as subcontractors and 

suppliers.

In selecting suppliers, Del Monte 

in the Philippines uses its Supplier 

Quality Management Programme 

(SQMP) which assesses the quality 

and delivery performance, feedback, 

recognition and continuous 

improvement programme for all 

direct materials suppliers and toll 

manufacturers.

1. The Company performs periodic 

audits of contract manufacturers 

and direct suppliers. Some 

independent and unannounced 

audits are used to address quality 

assurance and compliance 

issues.

2. It is our policy to seek out 

opportunities to buy from these 

suppliers where price, quality 

and delivery of service are 

competitive.

3. DMFI has a Supplier Code of 

Conduct for suppliers to practice 

and uphold ethical business 

standards.

4. DMPI issued a Code of Business 

Conduct to its suppliers which 

outlines the Company’s practices 

in building its relationship 

with suppliers while adhering 

to the principles of integrity, 

mutual interest and fairness in 

conducting business.

5. In the Philippines, the Company 

has an SQMP for direct materials 

suppliers and toll manufacturers 

as an aid in the selection of best 

suppliers for the Company.

6. The objective of the programme 

is to align DMPI’s quality 

parameters with that of 

suppliers, provide suppliers with 

performance scorecards, classify 

suppliers into certiﬁ ed, preferred, 

approved and conditional 

suppliers, and align suppliers with 

DMPI’s goals that would help 

support growth in the next ﬁ ve 

years. The programme serves as 

a tool to determine allocation of 

the Company’s requirements to 

suppliers.

7. The suppliers are rated based 

on quality performance, 

delivery performance and 

competitiveness.
