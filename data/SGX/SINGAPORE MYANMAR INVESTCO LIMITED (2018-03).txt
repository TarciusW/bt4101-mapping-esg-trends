Dear Stakeholders,  

It is our pleasure to present to you our inaugural sustainability report which covers the Group’s 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance for the year. Through this report, we aim 

to improve the Group’s transparency, accountability and progress towards sustainable growth. 

Furthermore, we believe that it will help us to improve our communication with our stakeholders 

regarding non-financial matters. We have prepared this report in accordance with the SGX 

Sustainability Reporting Guide and taken reference from the Global Reporting Initiative Standards: 

Core Option for disclosures on performance relating to material ESG topics.  

We believe that the key to our long-term growth is to build a sustainable business. Hence, the Board 

and Senior Management have taken the responsibility to ensure that sustainable practices have 

been incorporated into our business strategy. Many topics have been identified through our 

materiality assessment, which we believe is of interest to both our internal and external 

stakeholders. We will establish some targets in these topic areas to work towards.  

We regularly engage our stakeholders to gather feedback or issues faced from these various parties. 

This will guide us in the decision-making to further enhance the Group’s ability to create a 

sustainable business. These stakeholders would include our customers, employees, local business 

partners and their employees, shareholders and investors as well as local communities.  

As expressed in our mission statement, we want to play an active and pioneering role in the 

modernization and growth of Myanmar. We have not limited our role to just aiding the 

modernization and growth of Myanmar through our business operations, but have also contributed 

through other avenues. An example of this would be the Room to Read Program. The Room to Read 

Program is a non-profit promoting girls’ education and children’s literacy in Myanmar and the Group 

has pledged $250,000 to this cause for 2018 and 2019. We will continue to maintain a focus on 

sustainable practices for our stakeholders.

The conduct of materiality assessment helps to identify factors that can have a present or future 

impact on SMI’s value creation, and hence its business over time. 

To keep abreast of material and critical issues, SMI periodically evaluates and reviews its business 

operations against the changing business landscape, emerging global trends, stakeholders’ opinions 

and regulatory developments.  

Led by the CEO, the various Business Unit Heads assist in providing inputs and executing matters 

pertaining to the Group’s sustainability. Our review focuses on 3 key aspects and 5 identified 

material topics, with the material factors being plotted based on their importance to stakeholders 

against the significance to our business in the materiality matrix below.

Regulatory Compliance 

SMI is committed to conduct and 

manage its business and assets in 

compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations, which is essential for the 

long-term 

sustainability 

of 

the 

business. 

SMI has put in place internal controls and 

procedures to embed compliance into its day-

to-day operations. In addition to proactively 

identifying and responding to applicable new 

rules and regulations, internal audits are also 

carried out annually to ensure compliance.

mitigating risk and safeguarding the 

interests of our stakeholders. 

SMI 

is 

committed 

to 

good 

corporate 

governance 

and 

transparency 

in 

its 

endeavours. All employees are aware of the 

corporate code of conduct and are expected 

to abide by it.  

 

Social Dimensions

An inclusive workforce provides SMI 

with diverse perspectives, skills and 

talents. As such, SMI ensures that 

everyone is given fair opportunities 

regardless of ethnicity and gender. 

SMI adopts merit-based recruitment practices 

and emphasises diversity and inclusiveness, 

with the individual’s competencies and job fit 

being the basis of hiring. 

Employee Training and 

Develop

ment 

 

Our people are critical assets to the 

Group and it is therefore crucial for 

us to invest and support them in their 

development.  

Employees are sent for training programs to 

upgrade and improve their skillset. The 

training courses includes language classes on 

English and Mandarin, allowing the local 

Burmese employees to better serve the 

customers.  

Environmental Dimensions 

Reducti

Plastic 

Use 

 

Responsible use of resources such as 

plastic, reduces the environmental 

impact on the local ecology and make 

us a more cost-effective organisation. 

Paper bags have been introduced to reduce 

the usage of plastic bags at our retail stores. 

Moving forward, we aim to replace the use of 

plastic cups for milk at our Coffee Bean and 

Tea Leaf outlets, with porcelain milk jars.

The SMI Board and Management are committed to continually enhance our shareholders’ value by 

observing a high standard of corporate governance and commitment at all levels, reinforced by 

strong internal controls. 

Regulatory Compliance 

As a responsible organisation, SMI seek to comply with all relevant laws and regulations including 

the Listing Manual of SGX-ST (“Listing Manual”), Companies Act and Employment Act. In addition, 

we have attained the required Business Permits and Licenses for our operations in Myanmar.  

Examples of the Business Permits and Licenses that we have attained includes Business Licenses for 

the operation of SMI Rental Ltd, SMI Food Concept Ltd and Mar Myanmar Ltd in Myanmar, as well as 

the warehouse operation permit for Senko-SMI Myanmar Co Limited. 

On top of that, we have also attained the required restaurant permits issued by Yangon City 

Development Committee (“YCDC”) for the operation of Ippudo Ramen and Crystal Jade Kitchen at 

Junction City, as well as Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf at Yangon International Airport Terminal 1, Terminal 

3, Myanmar Plaza and Junction Square.  

In FY2018, there were no incidents of non-compliance with any applicable laws and regulations for 

which significant fines or non-monetary penalties were imposed on the Group. Moving forward, SMI 

looks to sustain its continual efforts in ensuring full compliance. 

 

Corporate Governance 

Committed to achieving a high standard of corporate governance, SMI adheres to the principles and 

guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (the “CG Code”). Additionally, the Board and 

Senior Management is dedicated to conducting business with integrity consistently, setting the tone 

at the top.  

 

Risk Assessment and Management 

Risks arises from varying forms and can have material adverse impact on the performance of the 

Group. Moreover, these risks could also be beyond the control of the Group. Nonetheless, SMI aims 

to mitigate our exposures through appropriate risk management strategies and internal controls.  

The Board is responsible in overseeing the risk governance in the Group, ensuring that the 

Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard 

stakeholders’ interests and our Group’s assets. Internal audits are also carried out annually to 

provide independent assurance to the Audit Committee (“AC”) on the effectiveness and adequacy of 

our internal control and compliance processes.  

Details of the Group’s approach to risk management and internal controls are set out in the 

Corporate Governance Report, which can be found in page 37 of the Annual Report.

Employee Training and Development  

Many of our employees are given the opportunity to undergo training to continually develop their 

skills. These trainings would include language classes on English and Mandarin for employees 

working at the airport, to equip them with the skills to be able to better communicate with tourists 

of different nationalities.   

Product trainings are also given to 

the employees from the brands’ 

representatives, equipping our staff 

with 

the 

necessary 

product 

knowledge and information.  

Furthermore, 

we 

also 

conduct 

customer service training to our 

employees internally to ensure that 

our employees are able to meet our 

customers’ 

demands 

and 

expectations, 

providing 

our 

customers 

with 

an 

excellent 

experience.  

In the spirit of continuous learning and personal development, we will continue to provide training 

and development programmes to our employees. We target to have 50% of all employees to 

undergo at least one training activity in the coming year. 

Employee Engagement   

The Group also has many platforms where employees 

are engaged, as we believe that creating an engaging 

environment is important for employee development.  

Some of the events that the Group holds to promote 

teambuilding and bonding includes the morning 

exercises that employees participate in together, 

Christmas celebrations, teambuilding trips and the 

annual staff party.

SMI is committed to optimizing the usage of natural resources and minimizing our ecological 

footprint. With most of our operations being carried out in Myanmar, we are aware that it might be 

quite a challenge to reduce our environmental footprint.  

There may not be sufficient resources or facilities that would aid our efforts in this area. In spite of 

this, we do acknowledge that it is important that we take steps towards improving our initiatives to 

manage the environmental impact of our operations. 

 

Reduction of Plastic Use  

In our bid to reduce plastic usage, we have considered several areas in our business operations 

where it would be feasible to do so. We have introduced the use of paper bags for our retail stores, 

in place of plastic ones.  

 

 

We have examined other areas in our business operations where we can reduce plastic usage. In the 

coming year, we aim to introduce a new initiative - replacing the use of plastic cups for milk at our 

Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf outlets to porcelain milk jars.  

We will also continue to remain vigilant in monitoring our compliance with environmental 

regulations and we target to maintain full compliance with the relevant environmental regulations.
