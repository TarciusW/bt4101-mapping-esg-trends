MISSION

Yongmao Holdings Limited (“Yongmao” or the “Company”) and our subsidiaries (collectively known as the “Group”) have designed, 

developed and manufactured a wide range of tower cranes, components and accessories since 1992. Sold mainly to construction 

equipment distributors and equipment rental companies in overseas markets and to construction companies and equipment rental 

companies in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”), our tower cranes are now exported to over 70 countries around the world. With 

a stringent quality assurance system in place, we are generally able to deliver a tower crane within 30 to 90 days. Our tower cranes are 

classified into four main series, namely the ST series, Topless STT series, Luffing STL series and Derrick Q series.

The Group’s production facilities are mainly located in the PRC. During the year ended 31 March 2020 (“FY2020”), the Group also 

completed the relocation of our Beijing production facility to Fushun City. The new production facility stands in close proximity to our 

existing manufacturing facility.

As of the end of FY2020, the Group employed a total of 1,036 employees in our Beijing and Fushun subsidiaries in the PRC and our 

Singapore office. The Group’s revenue rose 8.7% year-on-year to RMB962.4 million in FY2020. In tandem with this revenue growth, the 

Group’s gross profit grew 4.3% year-on-year to RMB248.8 million in FY2020. 

VISION 

We strive to be the leading provider for tower crane and construction machinery and to build a global presence through high-quality 

and innovative products and solutions.

Sustainability Report 2020 | Yongmao Holdings Limited 

About 

this Report

This is the third Sustainability Report (the “report”) published by Yongmao. As with the first two reports, this report discloses the policies, 

practices, targets and performance of the Group related to the material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics that the 

Group has identified. The report aims to enable all stakeholders to understand the Group’s sustainability progress and goals.

REPORTING BOUNDARY

The report focuses on Yongmao’s operation of design, development, manufacture and sale of tower cranes, components and accessories 

between April 2019 and March 2020 (the “reporting year”, or FY2020). Similar to the Group’s second sustainability report, the reporting 

boundary for this report covers the Group’s production facilities in Beijing and Fushun in the PRC, as well as our Singapore office. 

The Group completed the relocation of our Beijing production facility to Fushun City in September 2019. The new production facility 

is located in close proximity to the Group’s existing factory in Fushun, with land and built-up area approximately 160,000 and 35,000 

square metres respectively. Disclosures from the Beijing City are therefore reflective of operational data up until September 2019, while 

disclosures from the new Fushun manufacturing facility constitute data from September 2019. In the next reporting year, data from the 

two Fushun facilities will be collectively disclosed.

While the report does not fully cover the Group’s operations (such as the sales and rental business operations in Hong Kong), Yongmao 

plans to gradually expand the scope of its disclosures in the coming reporting years.

REPORTING STANDARD

The report is prepared in accordance with the “comply or explain” provision of the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711 on sustainability reporting, 

as well as the guidance set out in the Practice Note 7.6: Sustainability Reporting Guide (“PN 7.6”) issued by the SGX. The five reporting 

components prescribed by the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711B (“LR 711B”) underpin the key structure of this report. It also takes reference 

from the sustainability reporting framework provided by Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), the GRI Standards (version 2016 and 2018). 

The disclosures in this report seek to achieve the GRI’s Reporting Principles for defining report quality: accuracy, balance, clarity, 

comparability, reliability, and timeliness.

To ensure quality and impartial reporting, Yongmao commissioned an external consulting company to engage our stakeholders and 

compile the report. In line with the material topics confirmed during the stakeholder engagement process, selected topic-specific 

disclosures are included for enhanced reporting. The GRI-SGX Content Index is available at the end of this report.

OPINION AND FEEDBACK

Yongmao values the opinion of our stakeholders on how we can continuously improve our sustainability performance. If you have any

Chairman’s 

Message

In other aspects of social responsibility, the Group also continues 

to support available means of local procurement and adopt 

locally-sourced materials in our production process. This not 

only enables us to reduce the business impacts arising from the 

global lockdown, but also allows us to support local stakeholder 

groups during this difficult time to the best of our ability.

Furthermore, the Group recognises that even amid the COVID-19 

pandemic, other crises loom. Climate change continues to pose a 

significant threat to the world, with 2019 marking the end of the 

hottest decade ever recorded. To this end, the Group continues 

to pay great attention to climate risks and impacts, and seeks 

to systematically reduce our environmental footprint using the 

latest technology and cutting-edge production methods.

With these challenges and opportunities in sight, the Group will 

continue to scale and advance our sustainability goals across our 

businesses, as we bring the Group to greater heights.

Mr Sun Zhao Lin

Executive Chairman

Yongmao Holdings Limited

October 2020

The extensive and unprecedented global impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic has emphasised the sustainability imperative 

in many ways. For one, the outbreak has made clear the 

interconnectedness of diverse stakeholder groups, such as 

our employees, customers, suppliers and local communities. 

It has also underscored the importance of understanding and 

responding to material social risks and opportunities among 

these stakeholder groups.

In response to the pandemic, the Group has deepened our focus 

on occupational health and safety.  To ensure a safe working 

environment, the Group has established dedicated task forces to 

oversee and enforce health and safety measures in accordance 

with local directives and best practices. As the Group prepares 

for the next phase of COVID-19 with the gradual reopening of 

the global economy, we remain vigilant about operating safely in 

this new normal. This goes beyond restarting business to include 

seizing opportunities that may arise in this new environment to 

catalyse change internally and holistically.

Sustainability Report 2020 | Yongmao Holdings Limited 

Sustainability Risks

 and Opportunities

The Group recognises the importance of sound corporate governance and has assigned the Board the responsibility of determining 

Yongmao’s material topics and overseeing the integration of sustainability into the Group’s overall strategy. The Board in turn works 

closely with key managers to mitigate arising risks and to ensure that the Group achieves its yearly sustainability targets.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

The Board oversees the integration of sustainability issues into the Group’s broader strategy formulation for long-term value creation. 

By working closely with key management, the Board ensures that Yongmao achieves our sustainability objectives and addresses arising 

issues in a timely manner. 

The Board continues to delegate the responsibility of providing independent oversight of various functions to select Board Committees, 

including the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Remuneration Committee. These Board Committees tables material 

sustainability issues for consideration by the Board to inform decision-making. During the reporting year, the Group’s Audit Committee 

held four internal meetings, with all executive directors and most non-executive directors of the Board in attendance.

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

The Board provides oversight and guidance on the Group’s sustainability risks to safeguard the interests of our shareholders, enhance 

our performance, and address the concerns of other stakeholder groups. The Board does so by ensuring that the Group maintains 

a sound risk management system and internal controls in its operations. From this vantage point, the Board provides guidance to 

Management in determining the nature and extent of the risks that the Group should undertake.

With the increasing imperative for sustainability, the Group recognises the management of sustainability risks as an integral part of 

its long-term performance. The Group, with the support of external consultants, has identified some material sustainability risks and 

opportunities that have the potential to impact our operations and strategic planning.

RISK

OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSE

Economic Risks

The unprecedented global lockdown due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the 

Group’s operations and the business outlook 

for FY2020 and beyond.

Staying Resilient

The gradual reopening of the global economy presents an opportunity for the 

Group to adapt our businesses to the new normal. This goes beyond restarting 

business to include seizing opportunities that may arise to catalyse change 

internally and holistically. To this end, continuous innovation and adaptation 

remain at the heart of the Group’s strategy and business operations.

Occupational Health and Safety

In addition to the occupational health and 

safety risks that arise from the nature of the 

Group’s business, the outbreak of COVID-19 

poses new health risks for our employees.

Stringent Health and Safety Measures

In response to the pandemic, the Group has established dedicated task forces 

to oversee and enforce sound health and safety measures in accordance with 

local directives and best practices. These include the introduction of temperature 

checks, safe distancing measures and contact tracing.


Sustainability Risks

and Opportunities

Supply Chain Management

The pandemic has led to the closure of 

country borders, creating unprecedented risks 

for procurement and product distribution. 

Stringent health and safety measures have 

also imposed new constraints for the local 

movement of supplies and products.

Strengthening Local Supply Chains

The Group continues to support available means of local procurement and adopt 

locally-sourced materials in our production process. This not only enables us to 

reduce the business impacts arising from the global lockdown, but also allows 

us to support local stakeholder groups during this difficult time to the best of our 

ability.

Environmental Risks

Physical climate risks, such as more frequent 

and intense extreme weather events, arising 

from climate change can impact the Group’s 

operations and service delivery. The Group also 

faces other forms of environment-related risks, 

such as more stringent local environmental 

compliance laws relating to energy and water 

use, materials and emissions, among others.

Innovating to Manage Environmental Impact

The Group continues to strictly monitor the environmental impact of our 

operations in accordance with the latest national policies and anticipated 

changes. In line with our commitment to innovation, the Group also continues to 

explore new ways of optimising the utilisation rate of steel, which strengthens 

both our environmental and economic performance. Such a synergy represents 

opportunities for the Group to grow sustainably.

Talent Retention

Talent loss and a high turnover rate may have 

negative impacts on the stability, morale and 

creativity of the Group’s staff. The economic 

slump also poses risks to our workforce as the 

Group has had to exercise cost discipline amid 

dampened growth.

Enhancing Corporate Culture

In addition to the current training that the Group provides our employees to 

support their career advancement, the Group pays close attention to the mental 

and physical health of our employees, and has equipped our department heads 

with the skills and knowledge to appropriately engage with our employees 

according to their needs.

Identifying 

 Material Factors

IDENTIFYING MATERIAL FACTORS

Drawing on insights from regular stakeholder engagement and management interviews, the Group has decided to maintain a focus on 

the following material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics.

ECONOMIC 

PERFORMANCE

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of maintaining economic performance to deliver 

value to our stakeholders has been emphasised.

PROCUREMENT 

PRACTICES

In light of the pandemic and global lockdown, the Group’s procurement practices have to adapt to 

a new business environment.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Corruption remains an obstacle to sustainable economic and social development around the world, 

and has considerable impacts on social justice.

OCCUPATIONAL 

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group has to dynamically respond to the new occupational health and safety risks posed by 

the pandemic to ensure the health and well-being of our employees.

MATERIALS

Due to the nature of the Group’s business, the selection and handling of raw materials is critical in 

reducing our impact on the environment.

 

BOUNDARIES OF MATERIAL FACTORS 

The impact of each material topic may extend beyond Yongmao or the Group’s business operations and thus requires careful 

consideration. The table below summarises where impacts occur for each material factor. All topics are defined as material within2 and 

outside3 of the Group. The Group will continue monitoring any significant change in the boundaries of each material topic.

Yongmao Holdings Limited    | Sustainability Report 2020

Staying

Resilient

STAYING RESILIENT

The Group views strong economic performance as one that not only reflects positive growth, but also delivers value to our internal and 

external stakeholders.

OVERVIEW OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Despite industry headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s revenue rose 8.7% year-on-year to RMB962.4 million in FY2020, 

marking a record high for the Group. In tandem with this growth in revenue, the Group’s gross profit grew 4.3% year-on-year to 

RMB248.8 million in FY2020. 

On the other hand, owing to higher production overhead costs absorption incurred during the relocation of our Beijing factory, as well as 

the implementation of government-mandated COVID-19 measures at our project worksites and production facilities, gross profit margin 

dipped by 1.1 percentage points to 25.9% in FY2020. Consequently, net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company decreased 

2.8% year-on-year to RMB59.7 million in FY2020.

Continuous innovation remains at the heart of the Group’s strategy and business operations. In FY2019, our extensive research and 

development (R&amp;D) brought about successes such as the STT3930, our top-of-the-line tower crane model. For the upcoming year, we 

will continue to prepare new quality products for release, such the STL1045 luffing tower crane and STT1530 flat top tower crane.

In light of the pandemic, the Group has also exercised greater cost discipline to control our capital risk and ensure the smooth resumption 

of our business activities. To this end, all departments under the Group are subject to special regulations regarding expenditures since 

February 2020, including the centralisation of payment-related measures and the tightening of related approvals by the Group’s 

management.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

TARGET(S) SET IN FY2019

PROGRESS IN FY2020

Achieve positive cash flow generated from operating 

activities.

Target has been achieved.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and resulted in a highly uncertain business environment. 

While many countries have started to gradually loosen their containment measures and pockets of demand are appearing in the PRC, 

the situation is still evolving.

Owing to these circumstances, the Group expects growth prospects for 2020 to be dampened, with the financial performance of the 

Group for the first half of FY2021 to be comparably lower than the corresponding period in FY2020. The Group also remains cautious 

and will continue to exercise cost discipline and be vigilant in responding to changes.

Practicing 

Responsible Operations

PRACTICING RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS

Ensuring responsible operations is an integral part of the Group’s social responsibilities and extends throughout our value chain. To 

this end, the Group continues to maintain a range of practices that uphold the values of integrity, fairness and responsible partnership. 

PROCUREMENT PRACTICES

The Group’s Procurement Management Team, which manages equipment (materials) procurement and tenders, oversees the 

management and strengthening of the Group’s procurement practices. The Procurement Management Team is led by a general 

manager and has various heads of the procurement, production, sales and R&amp;D departments as its members. The team is responsible 

for the following aspects of procurement:

•	

The validation and approval of procurement plans and tendering projects;

•	

The examination and approval of procurement tendering methods and evaluation methods;

•	

Determining the bid evaluation team and its relevant staff; and

•	

Granting the final confirmation of successful bidders.

Under the Group’s procurement practices, bidders are required to submit information on technical standards, specifications, quality 

requirements, supply methods and delivery times of the materials when submitting their bids. The Group also requires its suppliers to 

have an ISO9001 quality system certification or other equivalent qualifications.

To ensure fairness in the bidding process, the Procurement Management Team first determines the composition of the members in the 

Bid Evaluation Team in accordance with predefined policy terms. For instance, professional and technical staff shall constitute at least 

two-thirds of the Bid Evaluation Team. The Bid Evaluation Team should also not include any personnel with conflicts of interest, and any 

interference with the process and results of the bid evaluation is strictly prohibited.

Yongmao’s procurement policy also stipulates a code of conduct for the employees. Employees or external bidders violating bidding 

provisions or engaging in bribery or illegitimate exchanges of benefits may incur fines or the termination of business contracts. The 

Group will conduct internal investigations and reserves the right to report any suspected criminal involvement in bidding-related 

activities to the relevant authorities.

The table below shows the breakdown of procurement-related data across Yongmao’s production facilities in Beijing and Fushun. 

Procurement-related data from Yongmao’s Singapore operations have not been included as Yongmao Singapore acts as an agent to 

sell products manufactured by the PRC-based production facilities and thus does not have a significant procurement footprint external 

to the Group.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Group conducts business with integrity and fairness. The Group does not tolerate any form of corruption, including bribery, extortion, 

fraud and money laundering. The Group communicates our anti-corruption policies and zero-tolerance of improper business practices 

through written documents such as the Integrity Declaration by Managerial Personnel and the Agreement on Administrative Integrity.

The Integrity Declaration by Managerial Personnel is signed by the Group’s management-level staff to affirm their strict adherence to 

the principle of integrity while discharging their relevant duties. By signing the declaration, managerial staff pledge to abide by the 

following code of conduct:

•	

Staff should not accept any gifts that can influence their business judgment, including but not limited to travel and entertainment 

arrangements;

•	

Staff should not use insider information, such as access to information on funds, technology, prices and customer resources to 

derive personal benefits;

•	

Staff should not use corporate funds to pay for personal expenses;

•	

Nepotism is strictly prohibited. Staff should not use their positions to seek any form of benefits for their children, spouse, relatives, 

etc.

In order to ensure that the relationship with all of the Group’s business partners is in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, 

the Group also requires our partners to sign the Agreement on Administrative Integrity. If any law or regulation is violated, or improper 

business conduct is observed, individuals may report their concerns to the Group or the relevant business partners through a designated 

hotline or email.

Procurement 

Practices

Increase the proportion of the total procurement 

budget spent on local suppliers or local 

subcontractors to at least 40% (for manufacturing 

entities), in order to promote local economic 

development.

In progress; Yongmao is in the midst of 

increasing the proportion of our total 

procurement budget spent on local suppliers 

or subcontractors, but has faced some 

obstacles in identifying suitable vendors who 

can meet Yongmao’s high product standards.

Continue to apply a rating mechanism to new 

suppliers and suspend business relationships with 

underperforming suppliers (i.e. suppliers who do 

not pass the rating mechanism) for at least two 

years.

Target has been achieved.

Anti-Corruption

Communicate anti-corruption policies to 100% of 

employees.

Target has been achieved.

Provide anti-corruption training to an increased 

coverage of employees responsible for different 

types of operating activities.

In progress; while Yongmao has successfully 

provided anti-corruption training to our 

directors, senior management and middle 

management, we will continue to work on 

extending this training to our office and 

administrative general staff in the coming 

years.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

Moving forward, the Groups aims to strengthen its procurement and anti-corruption practices in the following ways.

MATERIAL TOPIC

TARGET(S) FOR FY2021

Procurement 

Practices

Increase the proportion of the total procurement budget spent on local suppliers or subcontractors 

to at least 40% (for manufacturing entities) by guiding local vendors in continuously improving their 

manufacturing competencies and product quality. 

Continue to apply the rating mechanism to manage new suppliers while strengthening the evaluation 

of the existing suppliers’ compliance and standards, thereby further refining the rating mechanism and 

encouraging all suppliers to raise their standards holistically.

Anti-Corruption

Strengthen the communication of anti-corruption policies to ensure that these policies are observed 

throughout the Group’s operations.

Raise employees’ awareness of the importance of anti-corruption as a non-negotiable and essential 

part of responsible business operations, rather than merely a compliance measure, as a way of 

cultivating a good corporate culture.

Extend anti-corruption training to our office and administrative general staff.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has deepened our focus on occupational health and safety.  To ensure a safe working 

environment, the Group has established dedicated task forces in Singapore and the PRC to develop health and safety measures in 

accordance with evolving local directives and best practices. The Group has also established a Prevention and Control Office to oversee 

and enforce pandemic prevention and control measures.

Some examples of these newly instituted measures include mandating the wearing of protective masks and other protective equipment 

in the workplace at all times, observance of safe distancing measures and adherence to medical testing and quarantine directives if an 

employee has travelled to medium- or high-risk areas or is suspected of contracting COVID-19. Office premises and production sites 

are also disinfected regularly and adequate ventilation is ensured. In addition, physical meetings have been minimised, with virtual 

meetings becoming the default mode of communication.

The Group has also set out additional responsibilities for selected departments to execute in line with our pandemic prevention and 

control measures. For instance, the Human Resource Department is tasked with reporting a summary of employees’ temperatures 

daily to the Prevention and Control Office and enforcing safe distancing measures, while security guards are responsible for registering 

foreign vehicles and personnel, as well as conducting temperature screenings, before they enter the Group’s office or production 

premises.

In addition to the new COVID-19 containment measures, the Group continues to maintain our Safety Management System, which guides 

departments and production lines across our business operations in implementing occupational health and safety measures. The 

policies included under the Safety Management System have similarly been formulated in accordance with local laws and regulations.

The Group’s management also plays a key role in implementing and overseeing the Group’s Safety Management System through a 

clearly defined set of responsibilities.

Protecting 

the Environment

MOVING FORWARD

As the Group prepares for the next phase of COVID-19 with the gradual reopening of the global economy, we remain vigilant about 

operating safely to ensure the health and well-being of our employees.

MATERIAL TOPIC

TARGET(S) FOR FY2021

Occupational 

Health and Safety

Improve the working environment of employees and reduce the amount of intensive labour by 

improving intelligent manufacturing processes.

Normalise the provision of occupational health and safety training to all employees, expand the 

scope of the training, and strengthen employees’ awareness of their own health and safety.

Monitor the health of employees daily and control the rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 

diseases among employees.

Continue to control the rate of work-related deaths or accidents through improvements in 

equipment, working environment and process operations to eliminate physical safety hazards.

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

The Group recognises that economic performance is intrinsically linked to the health of the environment and therefore strives to 

minimise our impact on the environment. Yongmao’s Procurement Product Quality Agreement, which governs the resources acquired 

and used in our procurement processes, represents one such effort to safeguard the environment.

MATERIALS

Due to the nature of our operations, the Group generates waste materials such as steel material offcut and iron filings during the 

production process. To maximise the utilisation rate of raw materials and reduce waste, the Group collects waste materials at designated 

recycling bins for recycling. Part of the steel material offcuts are used for manufacturing the counterweight of our tower cranes, while 

the remaining materials are disposed for recycling.

The Group has a policy in place setting forth the proper procedures to handle production waste. All waste materials, such as iron filings 

and carton boxes, are dispensed and sold to qualified waste treatment vendors contracted by the Group through competitive bidding 

processes. The Waste Management Department of the Group is responsible for overseeing the coordination, approval and processing 

of waste materials.
