A description of the organisation's activities 

 

PSDL is an ASEAN-based property developer with experience in development and 

investment relating to integrated mixed-use and residential developments. It has been 

involved in key gateway cities across ASEAN, such as Kuala Lumpur, Iskandar Puteri and 

Bangkok. Currently, the Group has completed the construction of Phase 1 of the 1.3 million 

square feet mixed-use Puteri Cove Residences and Quayside in Malaysia. The Group’s 

property development project situated in Bangkok, Thailand known as “The Posh Twelve” 

has been discontinued. During FY2021, the development company of The Posh Twelve 

underwent a bankruptcy process and the Thai Bankruptcy Court had granted an absolute 

receivership order in respect of the development company. Further details are set out 

below.   

 

Puteri Cove Residences and Quayside, Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia 

 

Puteri Cove Residences and Quayside is an award-winning luxury marina-front mixed-use 

development comprising two towers of 658 units of luxury freehold apartments, four blocks 

comprising 56 SOHO units, and a separate tower of premium serviced suites. The 

commercial component is Puteri Cove Quayside, a two-level waterfront retail promenade, 

which is built to mirror world-class marina projects offering a comprehensive range of 

prime waterfront retail and F&amp;B choices. This development augments Puteri Harbour’s 

position as the ultimate marina-front dining, leisure and shopping destination. Pearl 

Discovery Development Sdn. Bhd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PSDL, is the 

development company of Puteri Cove Residences and Quayside. 

 

The Posh Twelve, Bangkok, Thailand 

 

The Posh Twelve was a freehold mixed-use development comprising two towers of upper

Kanokkorn Pattana Co., Ltd. (“KNK”), an entity held through the Group’s joint venture 

company. 

 

As announced by PSDL on 23 June 2020, Minaret Holdings Limited (“Minaret”), the 

Group’s joint venture company, initiated a bankruptcy of KNK by recalling shareholders’ 

loans made by Minaret to KNK. Minaret had submitted a bankruptcy petition against KNK 

on 22 June 2020 in the Thai Bankruptcy Court. Subsequently, the bankruptcy petition court 

hearing was held on 14 May 2021 and the Thai Bankruptcy Court granted an absolute

102-10: Significant changes to the organisation and its supply chain 

 

Significant changes to the organisation’s size, structure, ownership, or supply 

chain 

 

Currently, the Group does not foresee any significant changes to the Group's size, 

structure, ownership or supply chain. There was also no significant change to the Group’s 

size, structure, ownership or supply chain during FY2021. 

 

102-11: Precautionary Principle or approach 

 

Precautionary Principle or approach 

 

The Precautionary Principle is a strategy to cope with possible risks where scientific 

understanding is yet incomplete. When human activities may lead to morally unacceptable 

harm that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish 

that harm.  

 

Currently, the Group does not have a formal policy in respect of applying the Precautionary 

Principle. This is because the business in which the Group operates is well-researched 

and established. Therefore, unacceptable harm which is scientifically plausible but 

uncertain is not expected to be significant. Nonetheless, the Group does acknowledge 

the Precautionary Principle and supports the intent of the Precautionary Principle. If any 

situation, event or action occurs whereby harm or damage is assessed to be possible, the 

Group's management will immediately take action to stop, evaluate and/or seek 

assistance to avoid or minimise such harm or damage. 

 

102-12: External initiatives 

 

A list of externally-developed economic, environmental and social charters, 

principles, or other initiatives to which the organisation subscribes, or which it 

endorses. 

 

Currently, the Group adheres to the Workplace Safety and Health Act in Singapore as well 

as the equivalent regulations in Malaysia. Aside from adhering to statutory regulations 

such as the aforementioned and employment practices, the Group does not have any 

other formally-endorsed or subscribed economic, environmental and/or social charters, 

principles or other initiatives.  

 

102-13: Membership of associations

Governance structure of the organisation 

 

The Board of Directors of PSDL is assisted by three (3) Board Committees, namely the

Currently, the Board comprises four (4) directors, of whom one (1) is an Executive Director

102-42: Identifying and selecting stakeholders 

 

A critical component of the Group's long-term success lies in identifying and engaging well 

with stakeholders. Thus, it is crucial to identify and understand the demands and concerns 

of our stakeholders. Such stakeholders are identified and prioritised based on their 

dependence and influence on the business. We employ a mix of formal and informal 

channels of communication to understand the needs of key stakeholders and incorporate 

these into our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial relationships. 

 

102-43: Approach to stakeholder engagement 

 

Most of our engagement with stakeholders is on an ad-hoc and as-necessary basis. 

However, there are certain stakeholder matters which are carried out on a regular basis, 

such as dialogues with lenders and creditors of the Group, quarterly results 

announcements to provide updates to our shareholders on our financial performance, 

annual reports, annual corporate governance reports as well as employee engagement 

on at least an annual basis.

102-47: List of material topics 

 

Materiality Assessment 

 

In conducting its materiality assessment, the Group evaluated each aspect's potential 

impact on the economy, environment, social sphere and influence on stakeholders. 

PSDL's senior management took references from observations of PSDL's peers and 

industry practices, internal discussions and peer review, and applied the guidance from 

the GRI. Through these exercises, we have identified the following material aspects: 

• 

Economic: Economic Performance, Anti-Corruption 

• 

Environmental: Energy 

• 

Social: Diversity and Equal Opportunity, Training and Education 

 

The applicability and relevance of our material factors is subject to regular review. This is 

important in relation to the Group’s interaction with our stakeholders and business 

environment. We will continue striving to improve our performance in these areas and 

address these as they become better assessed across time. For the upcoming year, the 

Group will work towards further reducing its energy consumption by 5% to 10%, which 

shall be assessed by an internal review of the Group’s office’s electricity bills. In addition, 

the Group will work on implementing energy saving initiatives for its Puteri Cove 

Residences and Quayside project as and where relevant.  

 

The Group continues to preach a strong anti-corruption stance.

MATERIAL TOPICS 

 

ECONOMIC 

 

Economic Performance 

 

FY2021 has continued to be an extremely challenging year. The already difficult business 

environment and real estate market in Malaysia did not see any improvement in FY2021 

as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to rampage global business conditions. Over the 

course of FY2021, and even recently, the Delta and Omicron variants of concern had 

introduced setback after setback to the overall COVID recovery trajectory. PSDL’s current 

focus is on ensuring the sustainability of the Group’s operations for the long-run. This will 

be carried out through active fundraising (which had recently been achieved in 

October/November 2021) and restructuring efforts. Simultaneously, risk-management 

remains of paramount importance. 

 

For a detailed breakdown of the Group’s financial performance for FY2021, please refer 

to the FY2021 Annual Report dated 16 December 2021.

Anti-Corruption 

 

The Group has a zero-tolerance stand on corruption. In all our dealings, we expect all 

employees to strictly uphold the Group’s policy on anti-corruption, fraud, whistle-blowing 

and bribery clauses. PSDL also has a whistle blowing policy in place which has been duly 

endorsed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board. The policy allows 

employees of the Group, in good faith and in confidence, to raise concerns about actual 

or possible corporate improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The 

members of the Audit Committee will be informed directly for any matters arising from the 

aforementioned. The Group has a dedicated email address for whistleblowing incidents to 

be reported. This email address is: whistleblowing@pacificstar-dev.com. 

 

For FY2021, there had been no whistle blowing reports received (FY2020: nil). There has 

been no incident of non-compliance with relevant anti-corruption laws and regulations 

which would have a material impact on the Group for FY2021. The Group aims to maintain 

this clean track record going forward. 

 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

 

Energy 

 

The Group’s direct impact on the environment is limited, but we maintain a position that 

every effort to conserve resources and to reduce our impact on the environment does play 

a role in the overall global efforts to save our Earth. In the design of our properties, we 

consider energy saving and reduction of carbon footprint and weigh these against the 

capital and operating expenditure considerations. 

 

PSDL acknowledges the importance of proper management and conservation of energy 

consumption in order to reduce our carbon footprint. Thus far, the Group has adopted 

green practices such as switching off lights at our offices where no users are present, 

using energy efficient equipment, setting our computers to energy-saving mode and using 

air-conditioning only where and when function/meeting rooms are used. In addition, we 

encourage our employees to practice energy-saving initiatives, and to print documents 

only where absolutely necessary. The Group was able to reduce its energy consumption 

in its offices by over 5%, which was a target set in the previous sustainability report. This 

was also in part due to continued work-from-home arrangements implemented over the 

course of FY2021 as well as the various movement control orders in Malaysia in FY2021.  

 

There has been no incident of non-compliance with relevant environmental laws and 

regulations which would have a material impact on the Group for FY2021. The Group aims 

to maintain this clean track record going forward.

Training and Education 

 

Our employees are one of the most important resources in ensuring the long-term growth 

and development of the Group. Therefore, we fully acknowledge that there is a continuous 

need to upgrade staff skills and knowledge. Such training and education of our employees

will benefit both the employees themselves as well as the Group. Therefore, we strongly 

encourage all of our staff to attend courses and seminars to keep themselves apprised of 

the latest developments in a myriad of areas, including human resources, regulations, 

industry best practices etc. In addition, employees who are keen to expand their skillsets 

are allowed to work on cross-department work tasks with suitable coaching and 

supervision so that they can work towards becoming multi-faceted and value-added 

members of our team. We aim to continue providing relevant training to our employees in 

upcoming years.

The Group works hard to ensure that our employment practices are in line with local labour 

and employment laws. We have a strong stance against workplace discrimination; no 

employee should be discriminated against because of age, gender, national origin, 

disability, religion, sexual orientation, marital or maternity status, union membership or 

political opinion, among others. There is also zero tolerance for any workplace or work-

related sexual harassment. Any discrimination and/or harassment can be reported through 

our human resource channels or through our whistle-blowing channels.  

 

The Group is committed to providing competitive remuneration and benefits to our 

employees. We are also committed to safeguarding our employees’ health and safety 

against any potential workplace hazards. There has been no incident of non-compliance 

resulting in regulatory breaches related to relevant health and safety legislation for 

FY2021. The Group aims to maintain this clean track record going forward. 

 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has already implemented and 

practiced Work From Home (“WFH”) arrangements and has set up the necessary 

information technology systems to facilitate WFH for its employees as, if and whenever 

the situation requires. In addition, the Group is ready to implement alternate group work 

attendance to ensure business continuity should the COVID-19 pandemic worsen or 

continue unabated.
