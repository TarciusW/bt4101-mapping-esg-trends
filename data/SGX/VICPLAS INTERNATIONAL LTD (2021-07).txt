VICPLAS INTERNATIONAL LTD    |   Sustainability Report 2021   

I present the Sustainability Report of Vicplas 

International Ltd (“Vicplas” or “the Company”, and 

together with its subsidiaries, “the Group”) for the 

financial year ended 31 July 2021 (“FY2021”).

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many 

aspects of our lives, disrupting our sense of 

normalcy, claiming lives and causing economic loss 

globally. Even as governments around the world 

implemented measures to control this public health 

crisis, we have taken strict measures to protect our 

employees and their families, while at the same time 

ensuring minimal disruption to our manufacturing 

operations. We are extremely proud of, and grateful 

to, our employees globally who have made 

sacrifices to keep the Group operating smoothly 

during this difficult time.

In FY2021, both our business segments remained 

operational and contributed to the common fight 

against COVID-19. Our medical devices segment 

was, and remains, part of the supply chain for 

manufacturing of COVID-19 related medical devices 

such as nasal swabs and test kits. Our pipes and 

pipe fittings segment supplied products to support 

critical construction and public infrastructure works 

in Singapore which included quarantine/isolation 

facilities, temporary foreign workers dormitories and 

other emergency services.

We are following the guidance of all governments 

and public health authorities, and proactively 

implementing a range of precautionary measures, 

from stringent sanitation and cleaning protocols to 

workplace distancing and health checks (including 

Antigen Rapid Tests). Employees who can work 

from home are working from home to protect others 

who are required to be at a Group facility to carry out 

their work. 

Message from the 

Group Chief Executive Officer

As highlighted in this FY2021 Sustainability Report, 

we continue to track the progress of the Group, and 

have 

shared 

our 

performance 

with 

regards 

to various material Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) topics. While we seek to grow 

our business, we are mindful of our social and 

environmental impact in the areas that we operate 

in and are committed to integrate sustainable 

practices in our business operations. 

We aim to create long-term sustainable value 

through our business activities in the financial year 

ending 31 July 2022 and beyond – for us as a 

company, our employees, our stakeholders and the 

society at large.

About the 

Report

This FY2021 Sustainability Report (“Report”) 

is our fourth report and describes the 

sustainability initiatives and performance 

for Vicplas International Ltd (“Vicplas” 

or “the Company”, and together with its 

subsidiaries, “the Group”) for FY2021. This 

Report has been prepared in accordance 

with the GRI Standards: Core Option and 

Singapore Exchange-ST Listing Rules 

Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting 

Guide. We have chosen the GRI Standards as 

a reporting framework as it is a well-known and 

globally-recognised sustainability reporting standard. 

We also referenced the United Nations 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development and used the United 

Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN 

SDG”) to report on our sustainability performance.  

The report covers all subsidiaries for which the 

Group has management control, except for Arrow 

Medical Limited, which is based in the United 

Kingdom. This entity was recently fully acquired and 

performance data has not yet been consolidated for 

this Report. We plan to include the data from this 

entity in our next Report. The Group’s corporate 

structure can be found on Page 3 of this Report. 

This Report is published annually and covers the 

same period as the financial year of the Company  

(1 August to 31 July). Our last sustainability report 

was published in December 2020. Where possible, 

we have shared historical information on our 

material  topics  to  provide  a  meaningful  basis  for 

comparison. To allow for a better analysis of our 

performance data with respect to our business, 

we have reported the performance of our material 

topics based on business segments. This Report 

provides us with a valuable opportunity to engage 

our stakeholders and respond to issues that matter 

most to them and to our business. 

The Report is currently not externally assured but 

external assurance may be implemented in the future.

We welcome comments and feedback on our 

sustainability report at corporate@vicplas.com.sg.

VICPLAS INTERNATIONAL LTD    |   Sustainability Report 2021   

Alignment with the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG)

Vicplas supports the global effort to achieve the 17 SDGs that are intended to address the world’s shared 

challenges of poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice. The table 

below highlights our efforts and where we have the largest opportunity for impact.

•

Our plastic product lines from our pipes and pipe fittings segment are free of heavy metals 

such as lead and are manufactured in compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous 

Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1). The restricted materials are hazardous to the 

environment and pollute landfills, and are dangerous in terms of occupational exposure during 

manufacturing and recycling. By ensuring that our products are RoHS compliant, we help to 

reduce injury to people and damage to the environment.

•

We recognise the importance of women participation and equal opportunities for leadership

in the organisation – 20% of our Board comprises of females, and 25% of our senior

management team is represented by females.

•

59% of our workforce comprises of females.

•

We have increased our staff strength by 31% to a total of 1,133 employees in Singapore,

China and Malaysia. The increase in staff strength is mainly to support the medical devices

segment in Singapore and China.

•

All our employees are paid fair wages and accorded employment benefits in line with local

regulations.

•

As part of our continuous efforts to reduce damage to the environment, Vicplas is actively

pursuing the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems and ISO 50001:2018

Energy Management Systems to guide us in improving our manufacturing process to reduce our

use of resources, energy and waste. We are also exploring ways to reduce our GHG emissions

from our work activities.

•

Vicplas does not tolerate any form of discrimination based on nationality, race, religion or

political inclination that could compromise equal opportunities in the recruitment process and

career development.

We are committed to providing products with the highest level of quality and product safety. The conformity 

of the products, systems, and processes is periodically checked and confirmed at our various plants through 

internal and external audits. Vicplas has successfully implemented the requirements of the following 

certification-relevant standards in our manufacturing locations worldwide to ensure compliance with 

customer and regulatory requirements:

We are pleased to announce that Forefront Medical 

Investment Pte. Ltd. was awarded the Singapore 

Quality Class Accreditation by Enterprise Singapore 

in FY2021. This award recognises organisations for 

their 

commendable 

management 

practices, 

commitment towards continuous improvement and 

sustainable business performance1. 

Our supplier relationship management approach 

enables us to manage suppliers effectively, while 

focusing on our most critical suppliers to maximise 

value and reduce risks in our supply chain. We 

currently have more than 500 suppliers providing 

goods and services to Vicplas. We engage in 

regular, open dialogue with key suppliers to 

develop strong positive relationships and to ensure 

that their goods and services are aligned to our 

business 

requirements 

and 

sustainability 

objectives. 

In FY2021, Vicplas did not have any incidents of 

product recall or incidents of non-compliance 

with regulations and voluntary codes concerning 

the health and safety  impacts of  our  products and  

services. We aim for continual improvement and

to

through

our operations and, where issues are linked to third-

party operations, we communicate and encourage 

them to prevent, mitigate and address them. 

In FY2021, we have no cases of socioeconomic or 

environmental non-compliance. We shall continue to 

proactively monitor our operations closely to ensure 

that we maintain zero cases of non-compliance.

How we have worked with our business partners 

during the pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging 

time for businesses and individuals. Vicplas made 

several strategic adjustments to accommodate and 

ease the burden on our customers and suppliers 

alike. We also explored opportunities to assist in 

the overall government’s approach in tackling the 

pandemic – this included accommodating customers’ 

irregular schedules due to work disruptions and 

safe management measures which made delivery 

challenging; there was a surge in raw material 

prices and increases in operating cost but not all the 

cost was passed on to our customers; we are also 

currently holding a higher inventory of finished goods 

for our customers to mitigate any possible delays.  

For our suppliers, we work closely with them to 

ensure that they carry a higher volume of inventory. 

During global shortages, when raw materials were 

on allocation, we were well supported by our regular 

regional suppliers because of our long-term business 

relationship with them. Despite some delays in 

cargo arrivals to Singapore, we managed to meet 

manufacturing demand with buffer stocks, and also 

fulfilled all contractual obligations.

GRI 205-3 Anti-Corruption

Corruption is a threat to our business and the 

societies in which we operate. It can undermine 

legitimate business activities, distort competition, 

damage 

reputations 

and 

expose individuals 

to risk. As a listed company on the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX), we adopt the Code of Corporate 

Governance as required in the Listing Rules. Our 

corporate 

governance 

framework covers 

ethics 

and compliance through a Code of Conduct as 

well as action guidelines which are to be adhered 

by 

the 

officers 

and employees 

across 

the 

organisation. Every new employee is introduced 

to our Code of Conduct and our policies on ethics 

and compliances which includes areas such as 

anti-corruption. Communication channels, such as 

the 

Whistle-Blowing 

Policy, 

are 

in 

place 

to 

enable all employees and individuals engaged in 

business activities to report complaints of unethical 

behaviour. We have a dedicated officer who 

maintains a register of incidences regarding ethics 

and compliance issues and escalates to the Board, 

Audit and Risk Committee and/or management, as 

appropriate. 

In FY2021, there were no cases of corruption, 

no employees were dismissed or disciplined for 

corruption, and no contracts with business partners 

were terminated due to violations related to corruption. 

We shall continue efforts to train and raise 

awareness 

among 

employees 

using 

the 

company’s 

various business conduct policies to 

maintain full compliance in the area of anti-

corruption.

VICPLAS INTERNATIONAL LTD    |   Sustainability Report 2021   

We have embraced various green practices in 

our business and operation. Our pipes and pipe 

fittings segment fully conforms to the relevant 

Singapore 

Standards 

on 

Specifications 

for 

unplasticised PVC pipes and fittings (“Singapore 

Standards”) as well as its British, Australia and 

Japanese equivalent standards. Our products 

are used in buildings (residential, commercial and 

industrial), hydro-agriculture applications (plastic 

pipes and channels) as well as for civil engineering 

(telecommunication pipelines, power grid pipelines 

and infrastructure works). 

Since 2016, we have reformulated our plastic 

product lines and eliminated heavy metals such as 

lead from our pipes and pipe fittings in accordance 

with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances 

Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1) adopted in February 

2003 by the European Union. The restricted 

materials are hazardous to the environment and 

pollute landfills, and are dangerous in terms of 

occupational exposure during manufacturing and 

recycling. By ensuring that our products are RoHS 

compliant, we help to reduce injury to people and 

damage to the environment.

Protecting 

Our Environment

Vicplas is actively pursuing certifications for ISO 

14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems 

and ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management Systems 

for our manufacturing sites in Singapore, and 

there are plans to also roll this out in stages for our 

other global manufacturing sites. We believe that 

these standards will help us to improve our use of 

resources, energy performance, waste management 

and pollution prevention, which, in the larger context 

of sustainability, can play a part in combating climate 

change. Climate change is one of the biggest 

challenges facing humanity. Its effects are already 

evident with erratic weather patterns, severe weather 

events and greater environmental degradation. We 

are working toward reducing or preventing GHG 

emissions from our activities, and continually seek 

new and innovative ways to reduce the environmental 

impact of our products and services.

In FY2021, to better understand our environmental 

footprint, we have reported our energy consumption 

and Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions based on each 

business segment, and also provided the energy 

and GHG intensity based on the revenue for each 

business segment. We believe that this will help us 

to better measure our progress year-on-year as we 

identify opportunities to reduce our GHG emissions 

and work towards a low carbon economy.

GRI 305-4 GHG emissions intensity

Based on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, the GHG emissions intensity for the pipes and pipe 

fittings segment in FY2021 was approximately 91 tCO2e per million Singapore dollars revenue, which is 

5% lower than the GHG emissions intensity from FY2020. The GHG emissions intensity for the medical 

devices segment was approximately 106 tCO2e per million Singapore dollars revenue, which is 19% 

lower than the GHG emissions intensity from FY2020. Our target is to reduce our emissions intensity by 

at least 1% per year, and we have been able to achieve that in FY2021 for both the business segments. 

As we track and monitor our total GHG emissions and GHG intensity, we aim to identify opportunities for 

improvement to make our processes more energy efficient and will continue to improve on our 

emissions reduction in the coming financial year ending 31 July 2022 (“FY2022”).

GRI 302-1 Energy consumption, GRI 305-1 Direct 

(Scope 1) GHG Emissions, 

GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG 

emissions

Our total energy consumed from both the pipes and 

pipe fittings segment and medical devices segment 

in FY2021 was 63,159 GJ. The medical devices 

segment consumed 38,840 GJ of energy, while the 

pipes and pipe fittings segment consumed 24,319 

GJ of energy. The total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 

emissions from both business segments was 11,594 

tCO2e, with approximately 73% of the emissions 

attributable to the medical devices segment. Scope 2 

emissions comprises 99% of the GHG emissions from 

the medical devices segment. Our GHG emissions in 

FY2021 increased by an overall of approximately 8% 

compared to the financial year ended 31 July 2020 

(“FY2020”). However, this was due to an increase 

in orders from customers for the medical devices 

segment and a gradual recovery of the construction 

industry in Singapore. 

While the GHG emission from the pipes and pipes 

fittings segment increased by approximately 17% in 

GHG emissions compared to FY2020, its revenue 

increased 

by 

approximately 

23%. 

The 

GHG 

emissions for the medical devices segment increased 

by approximately 6% compared to FY2020, while the 

revenue in FY2021 increased by approximately 31%. 

To better explain our GHG emissions performance, 

we have also included below, the GHG emissions 

intensity which compares our emissions against 

revenue. Detailed GHG emissions data for FY2021 

and FY2020 for our business segments can be found

our 

headcount 

increased 

by 

approximately 12% to a total of 1,133 employees as 

of 31 July 2021 across all our locations in 

Singapore, China and Malaysia. The largest 

increase in headcount was from the medical 

devices segment, to cope with the increase in 

orders from its customers. We had an overall 

turnover rate3 of 23.9% and a hiring rate4 of 19.6%. 

The turnover rate was largely due to the medical 

devices segment’s entities in China, which are 

operating in a tight labour market.

Caring for 

Our Employees

GRI 404-1 Training and Development

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education 

is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. The training is 

targeted based on the employees’ job scopes and 

skills set requirements. Training topics range from 

soft 

skills 

development 

in 

areas 

such 

as 

communications 

and 

leadership, 

to 

technical 

programmes 

covering 

project 

management 

and office productivity tools. 

In FY2021, our employees received fewer training 

hours due to COVID-19 safe distancing measures 

and the need for group training to be scaled down in 

size. However, where possible, we have conducted 

training through virtual means and employees 

also attended online courses. On average, each 

employee attended approximately 2 hours of 

training in FY2021. With the rapid integration of 

technological and digital transformation in the 

workplace, we recognise the need to keep up 

with rapid innovation in the workplace and plan to 

increase the number of hours of training attended by 

our employees in FY2022.

GRI 403-1 Occupational Health and Safety

Identification, Risk Assessment, and Incident 

Investigation, GRI 403-3 Occupational Health

The nature of our business, as well as our diverse 

operations, inevitably create health and safety risks. 

Our aim is to limit those risks as much as possible 

so as to provide our employees a safe working 

environment. To do this, each of our sites in 

Singapore and Malaysia has a Health and Safety 

representative to drive positive safety culture 

and oversee implementation of health and safety 

practices in the respective facilities. Before starting 

any activity, we perform a risk assessment to 

identify potential hazards and do everything possible 

to eliminate them before commencing.  If this is not 



CREATING ENDURING VALUE

feasible, we put measures in place to minimise the 

potential impacts. Such risk assessments are the 

responsibility of our individual sites and are therefore 

conducted by them. In line with our commitment to 

workplace health and safety, our manufacturing sites 

under the pipes and pipe fittings segment are also 

undergoing ISO 45001 certification. This will enable 

us to better monitor and measure our health and 

safety performance and continually improve safety in 

the workplace.

At our manufacturing facilities, new employees are 

required to undergo a safety orientation before they 

start  work. This safety orientation covers hazardous 

activities at the workplace, safe work procedures and 

emergency 

response 

procedures. 

Safe 

work 

practices are also reinforced during daily morning 

briefings. All visitors and contractors at our facilities 

are required to undergo a safety briefing before they 

start work, and those who are conducting hazardous 

work are also required to show that they have the 

necessary permits and licenses required to carry out 

the work. Any person or employee who finds 

themselves in a hazardous situation has the right to 

stop their work and report the situation to their 

supervisor. In the event of an accident or incident, an 

investigation will be carried out by the supervisor 

together with the Health and Safety representative to 

identify the root cause.  

In FY2021, we had a total of 230 lost days arising 

from 4 reportable accidents at our facilities in 

Singapore and Malaysia. There are no reportable 

accidents from our facilities in China. One of the 

cases was a high consequence work injury which 

resulted in a finger injury. The other 3 reportable 

accidents that took place resulted in leg, back and 

hand injuries. We are currently implementing ISO 

45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management 

System at our facilities in Singapore and are 

committed to reduce the number of reportable 

accidents and lost days in FY2022.
