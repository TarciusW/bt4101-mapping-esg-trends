Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

Board Statement 

Far East Group Limited (“Far East”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to publish 

our thrid sustainability report (the “Report”). Sustainability considerations are key to our long-term 

business strategy and we appreciate the opportunity to present our achievements and ambitions.  

The board of directors (the “Board”) is responsible for the oversight of the sustainability agenda and strategy 

and has been involved in the determination of the material factors. The management has formed a 

sustainability council which works under the guidance of the Board to ensure that sustainability practices 

are executed across the different business units. With the assistance of the sustainability council, the Board 

has determined the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors that are material for the 

continuity of the Group’s business. 

Our material factors are  categorised into three key segments: 

❖ Environment 

❖ People 

❖ Marketplace 

Environment 

The refrigeration and air conditioning industry can play a significant role in reducing its impact on the 

environment. The phasing out of harmful gases and development of energy efficient products are two areas 

which can yield mutual benefit to both our business and society at large, and the Group has been working 

tirelessly towards these objectives.  

People 

We recognise that our people are key drivers for our success. We place great emphasis in nurturing them 

by enhancing their training and development and taking care of their health and safety.  

Marketplace 

It is our responsibility to exceed expectations of our stakeholders in the market. We strive to do so by 

delivering high quality and safe products, maintaining financial stability and tackling the risk of cyber 

security through robust policies and measures.  

 

We would like to thank our staff for their hard work in contributing to this Report and another successful 

year for the Group.

Materiality assessment 

Our materiality assessment was performed in line with the GRI reporting principles to identify the material 

factors relevant to the Group’s activities. We have collated feedback from stakeholders and reviewed 

sustainability factors identified by our peers to short-list potential material factors. We further engaged our 

employees through a survey to understand what areas they consider having the greatest impact on our 

environment, people and society. We have identified the following factors which are material to the Group, 

which have been prioritised and validated by the Board through the discussions with the management:

Governance of sustainability 

At Far East, we have established a sustainability council in order to oversee the development of the 

sustainability strategy, sustainability performance and monitoring, as well as the production of this Report. 

In consultation with our Board, the sustainability council organises information provided by operational 

teams in order to develop and evolve our sustainability strategy. The sustainability council is led by our 

Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and includes senior management executives from different teams including 

production and logistics, sales, and human resources, amongst others.

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

Environment 

Environmental compliance 

Why is it material 

The HVAC&amp;R industry can play a significant role in achieving the objectives of the Montreal Protocol (1987) 

which aims to protect human health and the environment by systematic phasing out of the production and 

consumption of ozone-depleting substances . Various other global and national commitments towards 

climate change are disrupting businesses across the industry value chain. We view these requirements as 

opportunities to evolve, and be innovative and adaptive to the changing demands of the market.  

Management approach 

We are constantly working towards the National Environment Agency’s targets for phasing out ozone-

depleting gases from our products. For example, we do not sell chlorofluorocarbons  refrigerants and have 

developed a phased plan to meet these requirements in accordance with the regulations of the countries we 

operate in. 

In addition, whenever we perform a retrofitting due to a change in refrigerants, we advise our customers to 

use recovery units instead of letting out the gases into the environment. Furthermore, we actively 

participate in seminars and conferences to educate end-users on environmental concerns with phased-out 

refrigerants and the available alternatives in the market.   

We follow similar environmental compliance standards across other countries of operations. In our 

manufacturing facility in China, we do not allow spray painting and are mindful of local compliance 

requirements when we recover raw material and dispose of chemical products. 

Performance  

We have not had any non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations, and have not received 

any significant fines and/or non-monetary sanctions in FY2019 (FY2018: Nil).  As at the end of FY2019, 

most of the new gases can be used in our equipment for commercial applications.   

Targets 

We strive to meet and maintain our roadmap for phasing out of refrigerant gases and maintain our zero 

record for environmental-related fines in FY2020.  

 

Green products 

Why is it material 

The refrigeration and air-conditioning industry can create a significant impact on global energy 

consumption and emissions.  

Management approach 

Our approach is based on developing and distributing greener products, as well as creating awareness for 

our users on the potential benefits of transitioning to cleaner systems. 

With a long-term vision, we closely monitor global regulations so as to be prepared for the transition in the 

market. We are moving towards a greater mix of more energy efficient products with our in-house Green 

Programme, which is central to our innovation and product development strategy. The next phase of our 

product development is in the area of using environmentally friendly natural gas such as ammonia and 

carbon dioxide as refrigerants to support the building of larger cold storages and logistics warehouses which 

will enhance food security.  


 

 

10 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

In addition, our product offerings combine different elements including equipment, controls and system 

designed to offer a comprehensive solution for improving energy performance and efficiency. Gradually, we 

will also be selling products that help to monitor the consumption of energy. 

We recognise that we can enhance our impact by spreading awareness and knowledge to our customers and 

the market. Within our service centre, we have an innovation centre where we display and promote high 

energy efficiency products as well as smart monitoring systems.  

Performance  

In FY2019, we continued with our studies to lower wastage and redundancy of materials by performing the 

following: 

1. 

Combination and merging of product models 

We continued to assess our lines of products and product models for the feasibility of combining 

some models of products while not eliminating the range of products nor compromising the quality 

of energy efficiencies of the products that we offer. In FY2019, we have combined our FEM and 

FEME low temperature chiller and mid temperature G5 chiller ranges, reducing the number of 

models by approximately 17% and 15% respectively.   

 

2. Smart monitoring of efficiencies 

In FY2019, we have partnered with Schneider Electric to be badged as their EcoExpert for 

Refrigeration and Building Management System (“BMS”). We are the first to be badged in 

refrigeration in Asia and look forward to expanding the services to our customers.  In addition, we 

also use Eliwell products and monitoring systems to help our customers track their equipment’s 

performance. 

 

Targets 

We aim to continue improving the energy efficiency of our products and increase the number of energy 

efficient products as part of our product portfolio, as well as minimise wastage and redundancy in 

materials.  The use of smart monitoring systems and technology will help to enhance efficiencies and reduce 

wastages.

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

People 

As a relatively small organisation operating in the distribution and manufacturing space, it is vital for us to 

maintain good succession planning and high retention of our staff. We strive to meet this objective by 

providing training development opportunities and ensuring safety of our employees at the workplace.

Human capital development  

Why is it material 

Human resource has been a rising concern in our industry over the last few years. This exposes our business 

to the risk of finding the right talent and ensuring a sound succession roadmap. High turnover rates can 

also lead to rising training costs and a decline in overall productivity and morale of the organisation.   

 

Management approach 

Attracting the right talent, nurturing their career growth and providing them with the right benefits and 

incentives are some actions that can create a more stable, equipped and inspired workforce.  

Training and development 

Training and development is a core focus of managing our human capital. Individual development plans 

comprising training needs are created for all employees at the department level, and are monitored as part 

of the annual appraisal cycle. Induction training is offered to all new employees and skills-based training is 

offered on a need basis. Some of the key trainings attended by employees during FY2019 include: 

- 

Solidworks Essential, StarMEX and Schneider Programme for Sales team 

- 

Schneider EcoExpert Badging (Refrigeration and BMS) 

- 

SAP Refresher Course for the Finance team 

- 

FRS 115: Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Construction Contracts 

- 

Info-Tech System Training for all staff on the implementation of a new HR System 

- 

AWS Certified SysOps Administrator for IT team 

- 

SMARTX Engineering &amp; Ecostructure for R&amp;D team 

Benefits and wellness 

We offer our employees with necessary health and insurance benefits. In FY2019, we have improved staff 

benefits by allowing reimbursements of staff claims for certain treatment sought at traditional Chinese 

medicine clinics approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, our employees have the provision for flexi-

work which enables them to maintain a work-life balance. We celebrate our success together with annual 

dinners held and in FY2019, introduced new staff recognition awards for staff who had been exemplary in 

their contributions in day-to-day work which sets a good example for others to follow, amongst other 

company awards, and build bonds through sports events such as cycling.

In comparison, the average training hours for Managers seemed to have decreased drastically.  FY2018 was 

an exceptional year where the training hours were very high due to the renewal of both ISO and OHSAS 

standards where many Managers went through training to be aware of the new standards and requirements.  

In addition, there was also a training programme in Sales which was organised for the Group where all 

Managers were required to attend.

Targets 

We continue to review our wellness and benefits programme, and align our human resource policies across 

the different entities in the Group in FY2020.  The revised HR policy will be implemented in FY2020.  The 

Group constantly reviews the benefits to the staff and aim to benchmark against market norms. 

 

Occupational health and safety  

Why is it material 

Given the nature of our operations, the health and safety of our staff, drivers and workers can be at risk. We 

strive to make sure that our efforts to mitigate this risk remain uncompromised. Not only is this a core part 

of our values, but any failure on our part can result in severe reputation damage to the Group.   

Management approach 

We abide by the highest standards in the industry and have obtained the OHSAS 18001 (Occupational 

Health and Safety Assessment Series) certification on safety. All employees and workers go through the 

necessary safety trainings upon joining the Group. We also have a dedicated on-site safety officer along with 

an outsourced fire safety manager who conduct regular tool box meetings, and defibrillator and fire drills 

to ensure that all measures are in place. The safety officer conducts inspections of all fire safety equipment 

before use and keeps daily records to ensure maintenance is done and the equipment is safe to operate.  


 

 

14 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

Performance  

As a result of these measures, none of our employees and workers has had any recordable, high consequence 

or fatal injuries in FY2019 (FY2018: Nil). By changing certain manual processes, such as the manual drilling 

of holes in fins to automated ones, we have also lowered the staffs’ exposure to work injuries. In FY2019, 

we have re-organised our assembly area to allow the respective staff to be more efficient and at the same 

time reduced their chances of injuries with fewer trips to draw materials and parts. 

Targets 

We will continue to develop,  roll out and improve on safety culture campaigns to advocate and educate our 

employees on best safety practices. 

 


 

 

15 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

Marketplace 

Product quality, health and safety 

Why is it material 

Maintaining the quality of our products is critical in the competitive industry that we operate in. Any issues 

regarding the functionality of our products or any harm to the health and safety of our customers on product 

usage can result in a significant loss of customers.  

Management approach 

All our products go through stringent quality control procedures before reaching the market. We design 

and sell products that have adequate safety features, such as certified pressure vessels on our condensing 

units and systems to minimise risks to customer health and safety. Most of our products are covered by 

warranty to provide assurance to our customers on the quality of our products. 

Performance 

We have not had any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of our products in FY2019 (FY2018: Nil). 

In FY2019, we have improved the design of the end plates of our higher-valued heat-exchangers to allow 

for smoother finish which eliminates burrs from the sheet metal as well enhances its strength to hold the 

weight of the heavier metal pipes. This significantly reduces the chances of the pipes being accidentally 

scratched or cut which may result in refrigerant leakages. This improvement also enhances our product 

reliability and performance.   

Targets 

We will continue to incorporate and improve health and safety considerations in our products and strive to 

maintain zero incidents of non-compliance in FY2020. 

 

Cyber security 

Why is it material 

We hold a large amount of data of our customers, distributors and suppliers. This data includes both 

confidential and personal information. Given the rising threat of cyber attacks, this is an area of risk that 

we take very seriously. Any breach of our systems can result in reputation loss, as well as financial liabilities. 

Management approach 

We are guided by the Personal Data Protection Act in Singapore to protect the privacy of our customer data. 

Our data is stored in an ERP system which runs on a cloud server and is protected under network security 

which only our own employees can access. 

Performance 

We have not received any substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy in FY2019 

(FY2018: Nil).  We have proactively engaged a professional external party to conduct penetration tests to 

check the vulnerability of our IT systems to provide the management with an assessment of areas for 

improvement in terms of our IT hardware, software and systems.  In FY2019, we have upgraded our servers 

and IT equipment to secure office network from intruders, implemented security solutions for network, 

email system and end-point access, established data loss prevention procedures and improved on our 


 

 

16 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2019 

disaster recovery plans. These initiatives aim to enhance security and improve confidence for our 

customers. 

Targets  

We strive to continue being vigilant in our review of our risk exposure to cyber-attacks and taking the 

necessary steps to upkeep our system security.   

 

Financial stability 

Why is it material 

Financial stability can be a risk to our business and if not managed adequately, it can impact the economic 

performance of the Group. If the economic value that we generate is sacrificed, it can adversely impact the 

payout to our stakeholders, including dividends to our investors, salaries to our employees, operating 

expenses to suppliers, taxes to government, and strategic investments to communities.  

Management approach 

We have a strong finance team monitoring the financial health of the Group closely. Not having a fixed 

dividend policy allows us to be more adaptive and less vulnerable to market changes. Our financial policies 

and procedures are reviewed regularly to keep up-to-date with risk management and control.  Audits on the 

policies are performed by internal and external auditors who are independent and provide us with advice 

for continued improvement and safeguards.
