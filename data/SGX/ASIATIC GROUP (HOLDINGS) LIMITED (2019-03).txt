Board Statement 

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present Asiatic Group (Holdings) Limited’s (and its 

subsidiaries, collectively known as “the Group” or “Asiatic”) second Sustainability Report. This report 

summarises the Group’s progress in the management of our material Environmental, Social and Governance 

(“ESG”) matters, while demonstrating our ceaseless commitment in upholding responsible business 

practices to deliver long-term value for our key stakeholders.  

As a board, we consider ESG matters integral to the Group’s strategic formulation. Leveraging on 

sustainability reporting, it has enabled us to strategically review our business in the context of the material 

ESG impact, alongside a phased disclosure of our performance with insights into the sustainability-related 

opportunities and challenges ahead.  

Following the foundation that was laid in our inaugural Sustainability Report, we continue to work closely 

with the management team to oversee and monitor our non-financial performance.

Reporting Framework 

This report has been prepared with reference to Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”) 

2016 standards. The GRI has been selected as the framework for reporting as it is 

internationally-recognised and provides a standardised approach for Asiatic to 

report on its material ESG matters. Reference has also been drawn from the 

Sustainability Reporting Guide of Practice Note 7F of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist 

(“Catalist Rules”) in meeting the primary components as set out in Rule 711B of the 

Catalist Rules. 

Reporting Scope 

The scope of this report encompasses our energy operations in Cambodia and the 

provision of fire protection solutions in Singapore. We have adopted a phased 

approach for reporting, with Table 1 presenting the subsidiaries’ operations that are 

covered in this report. As we mature in our journey towards sustainability, we will 

consider further expanding scope of our reporting to include other operations.  

Unless otherwise stated, this report covers Asiatic’s non-financial performance for 

the period 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2019 (“FY2019”), with relevant prior year data 

(“FY2018”) included for comparison where available.

External Assurance 

External assurance was not sought for this Sustainability Report, however, we will 

consider doing so in the future as Asiatic’s sustainability reporting practice 

progresses over time.  

Feedback 

We value all feedback from our stakeholders as it enables the Group to optimise our 

approaches and performance in sustainability. Please send your comments and 

suggestions to sustainability@asiatic.com.sg.

Corporate Profile 

Our Business 

Figure 1. Asiatic’s geographical presence 

 

Since April 2003, the Group has been listed on SESDAQ (now known as the Catalist). We take pride in our 

reputation as an engineering management specialist driven by innovation, and in our responsibility for 

developing Energy, Controlled Power and Fire Protection Solutions in South-East Asia.   

Asiatic’s niche business areas lie in Energy Services (Planning, Development &amp; Provision) and Fire Protection 

Solutions. Our operations span across Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia, with our headquarters based in 

Singapore.    

 

 

 

 




6 

 

Energy Services (Planning, Development &amp; Provision) 

We provide energy services for communities and industries, with operations predominantly in Cambodia. The 

Phnom Penh Power Plant and Sihanoukville Power Plant under Colben Energy (Cambodia) Ltd provide 

electricity to the national grid, while the PPSEZ Power Plant under Colben Energy (Cambodia) PPSEZ Ltd 

delivers electricity to factories and industrial facilities located within the 360-hectare PPSEZ premise. In total, 

these three operational power plants in Cambodia have a combined installed capacity to generate more than 

45 Megawatts (“MW”).  

Figure 2. Colben Energy’s three operational power plants in Cambodia 

 

As the future of energy steers towards alternative, 

renewable sources of energy, the Group has also 

invested in a biomass power plant in Malaysia in 2012, 

to generate energy from biomass waste. The Maju 

Intan Biomass Power Plant in Perak, Malaysia uses 

empty fruit bunches, a waste residue from palm oil 

extraction, to generate electricity. From this process, 

the power plant has an installed capacity of 12.5MW. 

 

Operating as an EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) and O&amp;M (Operation and Maintenance) 

contractor, we engage in the following activities across our entire value chain of power generation and 

transmission to local distribution: 

• Planning and Development 

• Capital Structuring 

• Engineering, Procurement and Construction 

Contractor 

• Operations and Maintenance Operators

Provision of Fire Protection Solutions 

Asiatic’s operation in Singapore is a specialised and 

well-established 

fire-fighting 

equipment 

manufacturer and service provider, geared with 

comprehensive fire-fighting and fire protection 

solutions offered to meet the needs of households, 

industrial complexes, office buildings and retail 

outlets, as well as marine and offshore industries. 

Driven by its mission to provide quality, customer-

centric and innovative solutions to the market, our 

value chain begins from the procurement of raw 

materials and supplies, to production, sales, and 

after-sales services of our products.  

Our People 

At Asiatic, we attribute our success to our people. We seek to promote and build an inclusive and diverse 

workplace, and to cultivate a collaborative environment to enhance our employees’ productivity and efficiency. 

We believe that our focus on developing our employees will contribute greatly to the growth of the Group.   

Figure 5. Asiatic’s Employee Profile 

 

Across our operations in Singapore and Cambodia, the combined strength of our workforce amounted to 176 as 

at end of FY2019, with 55% of our employees based in Cambodia. The decrease in the overall number of 

employees by 11% in FY2019 is mainly attributed to the changes in contractual demands in our operations in 









Figure 4. Asiatic’s range of Fire Protection Solution 

products

Cambodia. The Group is also observed to have a higher proportion of male (85%) to female employees (15%), 

largely due to the nature of our business which has a tendency to attract the fomer. 

At Asiatic, we are committed to providing equal employment opportunities based on merit, regardless of the 

ethnicity, religion, age or gender of the individual. In addition to that, we strictly adhere to a no child labour and 

forced labour practice in our hiring process. 

Our Sustainability Approach 

Sustainability Governance 

The Group’s sustainability approach is driven by the directives and inputs from the Board. As the core body 

responsible for the integration of sustainability principles, the Board sets the strategic direction for 

sustainability growth across our operations. The executive directors of energy and fire protection solution 

business are involved in the formulation of sustainability policies and initiatives. Together, they work 

collaboratively in driving key sustainability initiatives. 

The respective head of departments in the energy and fire protection solutions provides further support by 

monitoring the adherence and execution of all sustainability policies and practices on the working-level, which 

includes tracking the performance of the Group’s material matters.

Stakeholder Engagement 

Asiatic fully recognises that engaging our key stakeholders on a regular basis is key to the sustainability of our 

business. Our stakeholders play a crucial role in influencing the Group’s sustainability journey through 

feedback and concerns raised. We strive to address our stakeholders’ evolving needs by providing channels 

that are readily accessible for feedback as well as for honest and open interactions with them. Our approach 

towards stakeholder engagement is summarised in Table 2 below.

Materiality Assessment 

Asiatic considers material sustainability matters as ESG matters that significantly impact the Group’s 

operations and key stakeholders. In the prior year, a materiality assessment workshop was conducted to 

identify and prioritise Asiatic’s material ESG matters. These matters are subsequently reviewed on an annual 

basis to ensure their relevance to the Group. 

Figure 7. Materiality assessment approach 

 

 

From our materiality assessment process in FY2018, we have identified three material ESG matters as 

reflected in Figure 8 below. As there are no major changes in our operations,  the material matters identified 

remain relevant for reporting in FY2019.  

Figure 8. Asiatic’s materiality matrix

Regulatory Compliance 

 

 

 

Our Approach 

Policies 

 

Our corporate governance framework provides a foundation on the Group’s corporate 

governance practices. 

 

The Quality Policy in our fire protection solutions business embodies our commitment 

to comply with relevant laws and regulations.  

 

Commitments 

and Target 

We strive to always comply with all applicable socio-economic and environmental 

regulations. The Group has a perpetual target of zero confirmed cases of non-

compliance with regulatory requirements. 

 

 

To achieve a high standard of corporate governance, we have in place our corporate governance framework, 

which comprises oversight by the Board and the various Board committees, the involvement of independent 

external auditors, as well as a set of robust internal controls and processes that are internally audited by an 

accredited external party. The audit review procedures conducted yearly include checks on compliance with 

appropriate legislation and regulations, and the management of all corporate risks identified.  



Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To have  

zero 

confirmed cases of 

non-compliance 

Why is it important for us? 

The Group recognises the importance of having strong corporate governance 

and complying with laws and regulations in the countries we operate in. We 

believe that a good corporate governance enables us to effectively manage the 

Group’s risks and opportunities, protect our reputation as a business, and more 

importantly, deliver a long-term value for our stakeholders. 

We understand that any substantiated cases of non-compliance would have 

detrimental financial and reputational impacts on our business. Thus, Asiatic has 

a strong commitment towards upholding a high standard of corporate 

governance, in alignment with the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 and Code 

of Corporate Governance 2018 for financial years commencing from 1 April 2019 

onwards.  

 



Achieved in  

FY2019 


12 

 

The Quality Policy, as adhered to by our fire protection solution business, also reflects our stance towards 

maintaining strong corporate governance practices. It was developed as part of the Group’s established 

Quality Management System (“QMS”), which is ISO 19001:2015 certified. Through our QMS, we ensure that our 

operations are in line with the applicable statutory regulations and professional services of consistent quality 

are provided to our customers. 

The Group also has in place a whistle-blowing policy which provides a direct avenue for all internal and 

external stakeholders to raise concerns on all matters relating to misconduct, including actions of non-

compliance and improprieties in financial reporting, in writing to asiatic@asiatic.com.sg. All feedback received 

will be kept in confidence, and are directly handled by the audit committee, who ensures that an independent 

and fair investigation is carried out with appropriate follow-up actions. 

The management conducts an annual review of all policies and where there are changes, employees will be 

promptly informed. At Asiatic, our employees are expected to adhere faithfully to all ethical and legal 

requirements to preserve the Group’s integrity. 

 

Our Performance 

In FY2019, we are glad to share that there were no confirmed cases of non-compliance and no complaints 

received under our whistle-blowing channels. 

In addition, the Company acknowledges that that it has not complied with the Companies Act to hold the annual 

general meeting for the financial year ended FY2019 by 31 August 2019. This is a result of a delay to the 

finalisation of FY2019 results attributed to the complexities of the valuation of the convertible bonds for Colben 

Energy Holdings (Maju Intan) and difficulties faced in the recruitment of a qualified personnel in our finance 

department 1. This non-compliance case will accordingly be reflected in our next Sustainability Report for 

reporting period ending 31 March 2020. Proactive measures have been taken to prevent the same breach from 

occuring in the future, as we remain committed to achieving zero non-compliance cases with regulatory 

requirements.

Workforce Health and Safety 

 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

Asiatic’s occupational health, safety and security policy sets out our commitment to 

preventing all work-related injuries and illness.  

 

Through this policy, we are committed to identify and prevent risks in our operations, 

implement appropriate safe work practices, and provide relevant training to our 

employees. 

 

Commitments 

and Target 

As a group, we have a perpetual target of zero work-related incidents and illnesses 

in our workplace. 

 

 

At Asiatic, we operate based on the belief of “prevention over cure”. With this in mind, we have in place several 

workplace health and safety procedures for our energy operations in Cambodia. In Singapore, our risk 

management process has been developed with reference to Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Risk 

Management Regulation 2 and WSH Code of Practice 3 to minimise workplace hazards and risks within our 

 

 

2 The Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulation is part of Singapore’s Workplace Safety and Health Act. 

3 The Code of Practice was developed and published by Workplace Safety and Health Council in collaboration with the Ministry of 

Manpower, Singapore. 



Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To have  

zero 

work-related    

incidents and    

illnesses at our 

workplace 

Why is it important for us? 

Asiatic puts the health and safety of our people first. We strive to keep our 

workplace safe and healthy for our employees, sub-contractors and visitors, and 

we believe that it is our duty as employers to create a safe working environment 

for all.  

The Group understands that any failure in maintaining safety at our workplace has 

adverse impacts on our employees and to our business’ reputation.  Thus, the 

management place great emphasis in enforcing extensive precautionary 

measures to ensure safety standards are met in our day-to-day operations.  



Achieved in  

FY2019

operations. It outlines the necessary roles and responsibilities in our organisation and further, provides 

guidance on the identification of hazards, evaluation of risks, and implementation of mitigation measures to 

eliminate or control risks identified. 

Accordingly, a risk management committee was established to oversee the implementation of the risk 

management procedures. Comprising both managerial and senior staff-level employees, the committee 

carries out regular discussions and reports to the senior management on significant findings and 

developments regarding workplace health and safety, as required during the year. Figure 9 below summarises 

the flow of Asiatic’s risk management process. 

Figure 9. Asiatic’s risk management process 

 

 

To that end, Asiatic undergoes external audit annually to gain assurance that the Group has met satisfactory 

workplace health and safety outcomes. We seek to rectify any gaps found during the audits and actively monitor 

for progressive improvements that can be achieved over time. As a testament to our ongoing efforts, we have 

attained several certifications, demonstrating our commitment in providing a safe workplace for our people as 

listed in Table 3 below.

Table 3. Current health and safety certification 

Asiatic Fire Service – Singapore 

Certification 

Description 

ISO 9001:2015 

Quality Management 

System 

This certification sets out the requirement for quality management system and 

maps out what an organisation need to implement to demonstrate its ability to 

consistently deliver quality products and services to their customer that meet 

relevant laws and regulations. 

BizSAFE level 3 

Risk Management 

This certification sets out the criteria for risk management in an organisation and 

becomes an essential step in complying with the requirement in the Workplace 

Safety and Health Act (WSHA). 

 

Further, risk management-related trainings and certification courses are provided to select employees at 

least once every two years. These employees are expected to impart the relevant knowledge and skills learnt 

for others to similarly excel in their roles assigned and mitigate the occurrences of work-related injuries. We 

also plan to conduct fire drills and evacuation exercises regularly to instill increased alertness and emergency 

preparedness in all our employees. It will provide a refresher on the safety practices, precaution measures, 

and emergency exit routes that employees are required to be aware of. 

At Asiatic, we believe that  building a safe and healthy work environment is a shared responsibility. All 

employees are  encouraged to be proactive in preventing any work-related injuries or illness. We expect 

employees to maintain a clean and orderly work area, report any incidents, participate in safety improvement 

activities, and work with our contractors to ensure the implementation of the safety management system, 

among others. 

 

Our Performance 

During this reporting period, the Group recorded zero fatalities, injuries and occupational illnesses in 

Singapore and Cambodia. We will continue to strive to maintain this record across our operations. Additionally, 

we track the absentee rate of our employees as an indicator of our workers’ wellness and health. 4 In FY2019, 

we recorded a decrease in the overall absentee rates in Singapore and Cambodia. This is mainly due to lower 

medical and hospitalisation leaves in both operations during this reporting period. The details of the Group’s 

absentee rates are presented in Figure 10 below.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 Absentee rate refers to the percentage of total days of absence (medical leave and hospitalisation leave) over total days scheduled for 

work per year. To align with this definition, absentee rates in Cambodia for FY2018 are restated in this report.

Energy Efficient Operations and 

Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

We believe in investing in good environmental housekeeping practices to curb our 

environmental footprint and to ensure that we stay compliant with all relevant 

regulations and laws at countries we operate in. 

 

Commitments 

and Target5 

We are committed to managing our environmental footprint whilst ensuring a stable 

supply of electricity to meet the needs of the communities we serve. 

We aim to conduct a thorough maintenance regime at least once a year to help 

maintain energy efficiency and  carbon emissions intensity at our power plants. 

 

 

 

5 Our power plants in Cambodia are generally required to operate during periods of power outage or low power supply from the grid. As 

generation is on an on-demand basis and not continuous, this thus pose a limiting factor in setting a quantitative target to have 

substantial reduction in carbon intensity  



Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To conduct a 

thorough 

maintenance 

regime at least  once 

a year to help maintain 

energy efficiency and  

carbon emissions 

intensity at our power 

plants 

Why is it important for us? 

With risks and impacts of climate change becoming increasingly apparent, 

governments and companies are seeking urgent action on measures to 

address the impacts of climate change on their business activities.  

Asiatic is aware that its energy business in Cambodia is underpinned by the 

usage of fossil fuels and we are mindful of its associated environmental 

impacts. Whilst we acknowledge the challenge for our business to address 

this matter, we remain committed in providing a stable and reliable energy 

supply to our customers.   

For this material ESG matter and reporting period, we have included our 

energy operations in Cambodia. We will consider expanding our scope to 

include other operations as we mature in our sustainability reporting 

journey. 

 

 



Achieved in  

FY2019 


18 

 

 

We actively conduct regular internal inspections and maintenance of the equipment at our power plants. On top 

of that, a thorough maintenance regime is conducted for each engine once yearly to ensure that they are in 

optimal condition, and ready for operation on-demand throughout the year. Our inspections enable the 

respective teams to identify any nonconformity to regulatory standards and act upon them in a timely manner, 

thereby implementing appropriate measures for improvement. This has allowed us to manage energy 

consumption levels as well as ensure safe and efficient operations at our power plants.  

 

Our Performance 

We are pleased to share that with increased operational efficiency of our power plants during the year, we have 

achieved a reduction in our carbon emissions intensity by 8%, from 0.89 tCO2/MWh in FY2018 to 0.82 tCO2/MWh 

in FY2019. 

During the year, we consumed a total of 261,903 gigajoules (“GJ”) of energy from heavy fuel oil, and 4,459 GJ 

energy from electricity to generate approximately 25.66 Gigawatt-hour (“GWh”) of electricity that was sold to 

our customers. Measured with reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) 

Guidelines6, our total carbon emissions for the year amounted to 21,049 metric tons of carbon dioxide (“tCO2”). 

We have also achieved our goal in carrying out a thorough maintenance regime for all engines at our power 

plants for FY2019. We will continue to review and refine our practices as we endeavour to better manage the 

energy consumption and GHG emissions levels attributed to our business’ operations. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 Carbon emissions and carbon intensity are calculated with reference to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
