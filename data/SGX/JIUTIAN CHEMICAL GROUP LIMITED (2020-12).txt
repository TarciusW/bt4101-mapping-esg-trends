1. Highlights 

1.1 Corporate profile 

Jiutian Chemical Group Limited (九天化工集团有限公司) (‘Jiutian’ or the ‘Company’), together with its 

subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), are engaged in the manufacture and production of dimethylformamide (‘DMF’) and 

methylamine in the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’). We are also involved in the processing and sale of 

consumable carbon dioxide and oxygen. 

The business is divided into three main business divisions: 

• 

DMF division producing DMF as its main product and methylamine as our secondary product; 

• 

Sodium Hydrosulfite division producing Sodium Hydrosulfite; and 

• 

Gas and Oxygen-18 division producing consumable carbon dioxide, Oxygen-18 and deuterium-

depleted water. 

We are located in Henan Province in the PRC. Whilst economic development and industrialisation in the PRC 

began on the eastern and southern coast, this process has begun to spread rapidly inland, including to Henan 

and its surrounding regions, where cost of labour, land and raw materials are significantly lower. 

As a result, industrialisation and urbanisation are occurring at a rapid pace in these regions, and the 

consequent establishment of factories producing a wide range of consumer products is driving the demand for 

chemicals such as DMF and methylamine. Being the only significant DMF producer in the Henan Province 

(within 500km from the plant), we are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. 

In addition, our location in the PRC’s Coal Belt allows us to enjoy a cost advantage over other PRC DMF 

producers due to our secure and low-cost access to the coal-based raw materials that are used in the 

manufacture of our products. Our production efficiency and cost-effective supply chain management strategy, 

which include direct piping-in of raw materials from our main supplier, has provided us a relative cost advantage 

against our competitors. 

Henan Province is also on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway and its capital, Zhengzhou has one of Asia’s largest 

railway stations and network. Zhengzhou has been developed into a logistics central station for cargo 

transportation. This will further reduce the transportation and distribution costs of our products. Our customer 

base in China consists of customers in Henan, the surrounding provinces adjacent to Henan, namely Hebei, 

Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Anhui, and provinces in the Yangtze Delta Region, namely, Jiangsu and 

Zhejiang. 

Some of our customers are manufacturers of downstream products that use methylamine and DMF, while others, 

especially those located further away in the Yangtze Delta Region, are trading intermediaries that distribute these 

chemicals to customers that use these chemicals in their manufacturing processes. With our second 

DMF/methylamine facility of 120,000 annual ton capacity completed in late 2007, we have emerged as one of the 

world’s largest manufacturers of DMF with a total annual capacity of 150,000 tons of DMF and methylamine. In 

2020, the permanent closure of one of our largest competitors led to shortages in supply and also resulted in our 

Group becoming China’s second-largest DMF producer. 

Jiutian is currently listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(‘SGX-ST’) under the stock code C8R.

1.2 Message to stakeholders 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Jiutian Chemical Group Limited, I am pleased to present 

the Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (‘FY2020’).  

As a leader in DMF and methylamine production in China, Jiutian is poised to take a leading role in the 

environmental, health and safety (‘EHS’) aspects to ensure sustainability of our operations and fulfil our 

responsibility towards our stakeholders. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our stakeholders 

and focus on our four key pillars of Quality Management, Production Safety, Environmental Protection and 

Employee Well-being. 

We are aware that the Chinese government’s emphasis on environmentally-friendly industrial operations will 

necessitate us in keeping abreast of related regulatory developments and consequently improving our 

operations to comply with these changes. This pro-active stance will in turn place Jiutian on a more sustainable 

growth trajectory. 

In FY2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (‘COVID-19’) pandemic has created a global economic turmoil. While 

the first half of the year was characterised by uncertainty as global economic activity was stifled by lockdowns 

and safe distancing requirements, the Group demonstrated our resilience and perseverance and weathered 

through an initially cloudy macroeconomic outlook and swiftly leveraged on changing conditions to record our 

highest net profit since our listing in 2006. 

Among the manifold factors behind our performance, the swift recovery of China’s economy from COVID-19 

stands at the forefront. As other export-oriented countries grappled with the pandemic throughout 2020, 

China’s recovery and the resumption of operations have translated to a surge in demand for our main products 

from downstream users who are experiencing strong growth in both local and export markets. 

In addition, the permanent closure of one of our largest competitors led to shortages in supply and also resulted 

in our Group becoming China’s second-largest DMF producer. As a result, the average selling price of DMF 

and Methylamine in FY2020 was substantially higher than in FY2019. 

Furthermore, a depressed market for energy and related commodities suppressed raw material prices. The 

purchase price per tonne of Methanol, a key raw material we use, fell significantly in FY2020. We were able 

to capitalise on the turn of events to improve gross profit margins for the year under review. 

Lastly, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation. The Board has determined the material environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) factors and 

overseen the management in monitoring these material ESG factors. 

As part of Jiutian’s commitment to sustainable development, we will continue to strive to do business in a 

responsible way.  

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors

3.2 Quality management 

Overview 

Anyang Jiutian is primarily engaged in the manufacture and 

production of high purity DMF and methylamine to support 

the needs of our customers, mainly for their use as 

feedstock in the production of polyurethane (‘PU’). We 

have established comprehensive procedures to ensure 

quality throughout the production process. 

In addition, we believe that effective management of our 

supply chain can help us conserve resources, optimise 

processes, increase productivity and promote positive 

corporate values. We are dedicated to the consistent 

implementation 

of 

our 

procurement 

policies 

and 

procedures across our entire operation. 

Plant capacity utilisation 

In FY2020, the capacity utilisation rate for DMF production decreased 

from 62% to 56%, while the capacity utilisation rate for methylamine 

production improved to 100% utilisation rate year-on-year. The lower 

utilisation rate of the DMF plant was primarily due to management’s 

balancing of the production mix to maximise profit given strong prices 

of methylamines especially in the 4th quarter 2020. 

During the year, China’s economy recovered swiftly from COVID-19, 

while other export-oriented countries grappled with the pandemic 

throughout 2020. China’s recovery and the resumption of operations 

have translated to a surge in demand for our methylamine products 

from downstream users (e.g. electric-vehicle batteries, electronics, 

pharmaceuticals and animal feeds) who are experiencing strong 

growth in both local and export markets.  

On the other hand, DMF is mainly used in Polyurethane (“PU”), 

sucralose, 

electronic 

copper 

clad 

laminates, 

pesticide 

and 

pharmaceutical intermediates. Barring any significant resurgence of 

COVID-19 in China, we expect the demand for DMF to remain stable. 

We will continue to track and report on the plant capacity utilisation rate 

for DMF and methylamine. 

Ongoing maintenance and repairs 

In FY2020, we conducted scheduled maintenance on the DMF and 

methylamine plants. Major maintenance was conducted over an 18-

day plant shutdown in September 2020.  

Regular maintenance and repairs continue to be carried out 

periodically, which does not affect the daily operations of the chemical 

plants. 

Such 

activities 

may 

comprise 

minor 

technological 

improvements, maintenance and repairs on piping, meters and 

insulation, and other structural reinforcements. These maintenance 

and repairs will improve production efficiency and quality, and ensure 

that the chemical plant will run smoothly during the harsh winter 

months. In FY2020, total expenditure on maintenance and repairs 

amounted to RMB14.4 million.

Even as the DMF and methylamine facilities have been in production for more than 10 years, the Production, 

Equipment and Technical Departments are always on the look out to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 

of the current production work flow through process improvement initiatives. In FY2020, total expenditure on 

process improvements amounted to RMB1.4 million. 

We will continue to track and report on maintenance and repairs and process improvements made at Anyang 

Jiutian. 

Stringent quality management 

We are totally committed to customer satisfaction with quality products delivered through our stringent quality 

management process. Effective from October 2018, Anyang Jiutian has been certified to be compliant with the 

requirements of ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management System). This certification has a validity of three years.  

The main raw materials for DMF and methylamine are methanol and liquid ammonia. Each incoming raw 

material shipment will be subject to stringent analysis and inspection by our in-house laboratory to ensure that 

the raw materials meet our production requirements for high purity chemicals. Shipments that cannot meet the 

purity requirement are entirely rejected and returned to the suppliers. Ongoing production are also subject to 

hourly quality inspection to ensure the consistency of DMF and methylamine production.  

Backed by our stringent quality management process, Anyang Jiutian achieved 100% product acceptance rate 

by our customers in FY2020. As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to achieve 100% product acceptance 

rate by our customers. 

Purchases from Anhua 

Commencing from 1 January 2005, Anyang Jiutian signed a 20-year raw materials and spare parts purchase 

agreement with our principal supplier and shareholder, Anyang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd. (安阳化学

工业集团有限责任公司)(‘Anhua’), including the supply of coal, distilled water, steam and electricity. We 

continue to enjoy a close working relationship with Anhua to ensure the quality and consistent supply of these 

essential raw materials and utilities to our facilities at a reasonable price. 

Supplier management 

Anyang Jiutian purchases entirely from reliable local suppliers. A secure and stable supply chain is very 

important to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted operation of our production activities. As such, we have 

established a set of Supplier Management Policies (供应商管理办法) to be applied to all our suppliers. 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Supplier classification, 

• 

New supplier qualification and authorisation, 

• 

Supplier evaluation, 

• 

Supplier disqualification,  

• 

Supplier selection through fair competition, and 

• 

Inventory management.

3.3 Production safety 

Overview 

Safety is of paramount importance in the chemicals 

industry, and we have always stressed the importance of 

production safety in all our operations, especially when we 

deal with hazardous chemicals in each stage of our 

production process.  

We believe that one of the keys to improving safety is the 

creation of a more effective safety culture – one that does 

not emphasise production over safety. 

Inculcating an effective safety culture 

Safety in the chemical industry relies heavily on following correct 

procedures. Having an effective safety culture is hence very important. 

By building an effective safety culture, we can not only reduce injuries, 

we can also strengthen production, increase operational agility and 

move ahead on the journey to becoming a high-performance business. 

Anyang Jiutian is fully compliant with China’s production safety policy 

and has regularly renewed the requisite Production Safety License 

(安全生产许可证) on our production facilities. We enforce strict safety 

regulations and take stringent measures to ensure the safety aspects 

of our production facilities and processes.  

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to be fully compliant with 

China’s production safety policy with zero production stoppage due to 

safety incidences and zero serious accidents. 

At Anyang Jiutian, our Safety Committee is headed by our General 

Manager, and supported by our Vice General Manager (Technical), 

Equipment Manager, Production Manager and Safety Manager.  

Daily safety briefings are held before each production shift with weekly 

and monthly safety meetings to summarise and incorporate lessons 

learnt. There are also periodic sharing sessions from each department 

to highlight on important safety aspects. 

New employees are required to attend company and departmental 

orientation trainings where safety features prominently in the topics 

which are covered. They are also required to familiarise themselves on 

all safety aspects in relation to their job scope. 

In June 2020, we kicked off a full month of activities in conjunction with 

the Production Safety Month to strengthen safety awareness and 

safety aspects in our daily operations in line with the principles of “Zero 

Violations, Zero Hazards, Zero Accidents” (无三违、无隐患、无事故). 

We also organise monthly safety competitions between different 

production shifts and reward the winning team with additional salary 

incentives. We believe that this is an effective motivational tool to 

improve production without compromising safety.

Production safety management 

We are totally committed to production safety and have established a set of Production Safety Management 

Policies (安全生产管理制度) that requires all employees to adhere to the relevant safety laws and regulations 

and company standards. Effective from October 2018, Anyang Jiutian has been certified to be compliant with 

the requirements of OHSAS18001:2007 (Health &amp; Safety Management System). This certification has a 

validity of three years.  

Our employees are required to familiarise themselves with and uphold safety standards in order to achieve 

“Safety First, Effective Prevention, and Comprehensive Management” (安全第一、预防为主、综合治理). 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Effective safety culture, 

• 

Safety training and development, 

• 

Occupational health and safety, 

•

3.4 Environmental protection 

Overview 

Environmental protection is fast gaining traction in China 

amongst policy makers and the public. This move has 

posed significant implications, especially to the chemicals 

industry. As one of the largest producers of DMF and 

methylamine in China, Anyang Jiutian is committed to 

ensuring our full compliance with national environmental 

regulations.  

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure the 

Anyang Jiutian’s commitment towards environmental 

protection, 

reducing 

carbon 

emissions, 

preventing 

pollution, and minimising waste can be achieved during our 

daily operations. 

Environmental policy in China 

Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's Congress 

and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the 

People's Republic of China. The central government issues strict 

regulations for which the actual monitoring and enforcement is largely 

undertaken by the local governments. 

In January 2015, a new environmental law came into effect, covering 

land, water and air pollution. It contains strict penalties, including 

seizing of the property of illegal polluters, with company executives 

subject to prison sentences of 15 days. There is no upper limit on fines. 

More than 300 different groups will be able to sue on the behalf of 

people harmed by pollution. 

Anyang Jiutian is fully compliant with China’s environmental policy and 

has obtained the requisite clearance on its environmental protection 

facilities since November 2015.  

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to be fully compliant with 

China’s environmental policy with zero environmental incidents and 

zero fines on contravention of environmental regulations. 

To address the increasingly stringent national environmental policy in 

China, Anyang Jiutian’s management requires all environmental 

matters to be addressed as high priority through the following steps: 

• 

Manage and analyse the root causes of environmental 

incidents in a timely manner, 

• 

Adopt a conscientious and persistent attitude towards the 

improvement of processes, and 

• 

Maintain an open mind towards the adoption of new and 

advanced technology and management methods.

Environmental protection management 

At Anyang Jiutian, our Environmental Protection Committee is headed by our General Manager and supported 

by our Vice General Manager (Technical), Equipment Manager, Production Manager and Safety Manager. 

They will oversee all environmental protection matters in the Company. 

We are totally committed to environment protection and have established a set of Environmental Protection 

Management Policies (环境保护管理制度) that requires all employees to adhere to the relevant environmental 

protection laws and regulations and company standards. Effective from October 2018, Anyang Jiutian has 

been certified to be complaint with the requirements of ISO14001:2015 (Environmental Management System). 

This certification has a validity of three years and will be renewed in 2021.  

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Source pollution management, 

• 

Air pollution monitoring, 

• 

Proper discharge of solid and liquid waste 

• 

Pollution management, and 

• 

Pollution management diagrams for our production of DMF and methylamine. 

Managing carbon emissions 

 

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from each our businesses and then calculate 

our total annual greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions. We follow the GHG Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the standard manual for 

measuring corporate GHG emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 100% of the emissions 

associated with businesses which we directly control. Our carbon footprint includes: 

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity and steam used in our facilities (Scope 2 emissions) 

• 

Impact of business travel, and transportation of goods to our customers (optional Scope 3 emissions) 



Sources of 

Carbon 

Emissions 


Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 

Jiutian Chemical Group Limited | 16 

 

 

 

 

 

In FY2020, Anyang Jiutian generated a carbon footprint of 874 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission (‘tCO2e’) 

with a carbon emission intensity of 3.69 kgCO2e per tonne of production, representing a 10% decrease from 

the previous year. The emission mainly arises from purchased steam used in the production process which 

accounted for 79% of the total carbon emission of Anyang Jiutian. 

The reduction in carbon emission intensity is mainly due to improved energy efficiency in our production, as 

well as decrease in international air travel due to COVID-19.  

We recognise that reducing carbon emissions in our daily operations has a positive effect on climate change 

and have achieved our target of reducing our carbon footprint intensity by 3% from a FY2018 baseline. We will 

work towards ensuring that our carbon footprint intensity in future years continue to achieve this target. 

Energy efficiency 

Production facilities are energy-intensive structures and energy consumption, comprising of purchased 

electricity and steam, constitutes a significant proportion of our operating expenses. By investing in energy 

efficiency, we not only help protect the environment but can also lower our financial costs. 

To enhance our existing assets, we have allocated considerable resources to process improvement initiatives 

over the years. We have optimised eco-efficiency in our production operations to cut our energy consumption 

with the primary goal of reducing our carbon footprint. For example, we are improving the energy efficiency of 

our boilers through regular maintenance and refurbishment. Occasionally, we also introduce more extensive 

process improvements through our major maintenance exercise. 

Gaseous emissions 

DMF and methylamine production produce fumes containing hydrogen sulphide and ammonia respectively. 

These obnoxious fumes need to be securely collected and treated before they can be safely released into the 

atmosphere. 

Hydrogen sulphide gas from DMF production will undergo a desulphurisation process to remove the presence 

of sulphur to a level of less than 0.1 parts-per million (‘ppm’). On the other hand, ammonia gas from 

methylamine production is recovered, purified and recycled as feedstock for the production.  

As a result, the fumes released into the atmosphere will be able to meet the requirements of the gas emission 

standard of the Henan Province. As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our gaseous 

emissions meet the local emission standards. 

Waste and wastewater management 

Waste materials from the production of DMF and methylamine are not significant. Any waste engine oils and 

materials recovered from maintenance of piping, meters and insulation will be aggregated in a locked and 

isolated container and disposed through proper biohazard disposal channels. 

Wastewater disposal is handled by Anhua on Anyang Jiutian’s behalf. Anhua’s facilities are able to handle up 

to 15,000 m3 of wastewater a day, through a set of parallel biological treatment tanks.  

As a result, the treated wastewater discharge will be able to meet the requirements of the water emission 

standard of the Henan Province. As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our 

wastewater discharge meet the local emission standards. 

In FY2020, Anyang Jiutian had a wastewater discharge intensity of 0.65 m3 per tonne of production. We will 

continue to strive to reduce wastewater discharge due to increasingly stringent environmental laws and 

regulations in China.

Saving water 

In Anyang Jiutian, water is extensively used as a natural coolant to ensure that our reactor towers are 

maintained at the correct temperature during chemical production. Where possible, Anyang Jiutian already 

has procedures in place to utilise recycled water for its processes.  

In FY2019, we installed new water meters to more accurately measure our water consumption, and water 

recycled and reused. Anyang Jiutian had a water consumption intensity of 0.46 m3 per tonne of production. In 

addition, up to 73% of municipal water consumption is being recycled and reused. 

We will continue to track and monitor our performance on wastewater discharge, water consumption, and 

water recycling and reused. Progress and performance improvement will be reported every year.

3.4 Employee well-being 

Overview 

To increase productivity, we have a comprehensive 

performance appraisal programme and rewards system 

based on the result of the appraisal. The performance 

appraisal programme is essential for us to understand the 

skills level of the employees and appropriate training 

programmes can be designed to fill up the skill gaps.  

We emphasise on the career path and progression of our 

employees. To achieve this, the management builds 

several two-way communication channels to ensure the 

career development needs of the employee are taken into 

consideration whenever possible. Training opportunities 

are equal to all employees based on needs identified.  

Though these efforts, Anyang Jiutian is well-positioned to 

provide a constructive working experience to our 

employees and contribute to the economic development 

and skilled labour resources of the local community.

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employees excel, we emphasise on continuous learning in the workplace. Every employee 

has equal opportunities to upgrade and sharpen his or her skill set through formal and on-the-job internal 

training programs and inter-departmental competitions. 

In FY2020, Anyang Jiutian invested an average of 88 hours of training on each employee, representing a slight 

increase from the previous year. This is due to efforts by the Company to ensure employee’s skill competency.  

We have achieved our target of a minimum of 80 hours of training per employee and will work towards 

achieving the same target in future years. 

Performance appraisal  

To ensure that we achieve our goals, we have various performance appraisal methods in place to determine 

the performance of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable evaluation criteria. In addition, we actively 

collect performance information for each employee each month through inputs from direct supervisors and 

feedbacks, as well as periodical employee communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance and skills development needs of each 

team and individual employee from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop annual training 

programs that are designed to enhance the skills of the employee and aims to improve the overall productivity.  

In FY2020, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual performance appraisal by their superiors. We 

seek to continue this practice in the coming year.

Equal opportunity 

Anyang Jiutian has always been an equal opportunity employer to provide a fair workplace for employees, 

following the principles of equality and non-discrimination. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and benefits 

are required to be handled based on objective assessment, equal opportunity and non-discrimination 

regardless of gender, race, marital status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status.  

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that includes recruitment application, job 

description, job applications, interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on performance 

and suitability.  

We offer competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff members. Remuneration packages 

(which includes the necessary social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with current 

employment market benchmarks. Dismissal also complies with employment laws and regulations relating to 

non-discrimination. 

In FY2020, female employees comprise 42% of our entire workforce, with female representation in 

management at 31%. We will continue to track and monitor female representation in our workforce and report 

these statistics every year.  

Encouraging work-life balance  

We organised a variety of employee activities to help them relax their mind and body, develop teamwork, 

explore their talent, so as to develop a positive attitude in both work and life.  

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee health and improve employee work-life 

balance, Anyang Jiutian has been organising periodic sports competitions, arranging for gift packs during major 

festivals (e.g. spring festival, duanwu festival, midautumn festival) and family care packs during summer and 

winter. In addition, Anyang Jiutian organises free annual health checks for its employees and gives out 

monetary supports to its needy workers. 

Business continuity 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on businesses and communities globally. All the 

operations of the Group are situated in Anyang, PRC. 

In demonstrating our solidarity to join the authorities' efforts to control the pace of the spread of COVID-19, the 

Group has complied with the directives from the Chinese government and local authorities in Anyang. In 

addition, the Group has instituted precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of its employees. 

We have also initiated business continuity planning to protect our staff and mitigate the impact on the Group’s 

business operations.  

We will monitor the local situation and will put in place the above practices and any additional controls as 

required by the local governments (e.g. quarantine measures, stop work orders) where applicable.  

Although life in the PRC has largely returned to normal post COVID-19, the global situation remains fluid. We 

shall keep a close eye on our operations, and announce any material changes to our business performance 

to shareholders timely, as and when appropriate.
