CEOSSTATEMENT
"Our commitment towards
running a responsible
business requires a delicate
balancing of the long-term
interests of our employees,
planet, and profitability."
Mr Lim Yong Sheng
Executive Director & Group CEO
Dear Stakeholders,
As the leading jewellery retailer in Singapore, SK Jewellery Group Limited ("SKG",
and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") strives to create long-term value
for its stakeholders. In 2018, SKG released its inaugural Sustainability Report,
which shared the Group's current practices of embedding sustainability within its
day-to-day operations. Our commitment towards running a responsible business
requires a delicate balancing of the long-term interests of our employees, planet,
and profitability. This year's report aims to highlight the Group's on-going progress
in its sustainability efforts, as well as its near-term strategies and long-term
 approaches to sustainability.
The first key pillar of our sustainability strategy revolves around understanding
SKG's economic viability, with our customers being our key stakeholders. Over
the last 10 years, we have witnessed a mass shift towards new digital technology

05 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018
in consumer purchasing patterns, which is rapidly transforming the jewellery
business landscape. We believe long-term business sustainability requires
investment towards digital technologies, and to adopt a digital first mind-set in
all our business efforts to drive growth. Specifically, we are focusing efforts in
our e-commerce platform, and also adopting digital transformation of our core
operationalprocesses.
In addition, one of the key facets of the Group's business sustainability is centred
on building our status as an international brand, championed through Love & Co.
bridal jewellery collections. We are heavily investing efforts in the Thailand and the
People's Republic of China ("PRC") markets, to focus on encapsulating a share of
the increasing affluence and rising disposable incomes of the millennial customers
there. I am pleased to share that in September 2018, we opened our fourth Love & Co.
outlet in the PRC, and are heavily bolstering brand building efforts in Thailand.
The social pillar is focused on the wellness, and improvement of the quality of life
of our direct community. To reach out and make a difference towards the less
privileged, we have partnered with Radin Mas Community Centre. Project Sayang,
a goodwill initiative, seeks to improve the quality of life of low-income households.
Our employees readily volunteered to help deliver food,necessities, and household
appliances to these families, and we aim to drive this initiative forward as an
example of how companies can seek to improve inclusive growth within the local
community. We have recently concluded our third series of volunteering in April
2019, and will continue to explore opportunities within the social sphere.
Our final pillar focuses on our employees, who make all the difference towards
our drive for success. We want to encourage lifelong learning, and prepare our
employees for the fast-changing environment of the retail landscape. Therefore,
we identify high-performing staff, and place them on training courses to further
develop their expertise.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to reiterate the Group's commitment towards
building a sustainable business. We invite you, our key stakeholders, to join us on
this journey, and share your views with us on our sustainability journey.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
We believe that focusing on product responsibility is essential at the start of the supply chain of products. Through
responsible management of supply chain, key stakeholders of our business, in particular our customers, will establish
confidence in our products, enhanced satisfaction and long term relationship with our business.
The Group main purchases were diamonds and gold and continue to purchase high quality diamonds and gold.
To ensure our products are at highest level of quality and safety for our customers and to encourage sustainable
business practices, we continue to assess the quality of our suppliers, based on their experience, expertise, quality and
past performance that we have with these selected suppliers.
In our approach to sustainable and responsible business practices, we actively monitor and ensure that our suppliers
comply with the relevant regulations such as Best Practice Principles (BPP) of De Beers, Responsible Jewellery Council
(RJC), World Diamond Council (WDC) and World Jewellery Confederation (CIBJO).
We monitor compliance measures implemented by our suppliers such as know-your-customer checks to establish
identity ownership in ensuring diamonds sourced are conflict-free, and uphold responsible and ethical practices
within the industry.
The Group generally does not put itself in long-term exclusive agreements with any of our suppliers as
this provides us with the opportunity and flexibility to evaluate and select other suppliers in accordance with the
Group's policy and criteria as mentioned above.

STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT

we adhere to the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (the "Code"), where
appropriate. These principles and guidelines serves as a basis and guideline to the Board's commitment in having
effective corporate practices to safeguard against fraud and dubious financial transactions, with the aim of protecting
shareholders' interests and to promote confidence from our shareholders, which plays a vital role in the Group's long
term success.
The Group recognises the importance of, and is committed to ensuring a healthy and safe working environment
for our employees. As such, we place emphasis on accountability, being transparent and conduct our business in
an ethical manner. Employees of the Group are expected to exhibit highest standards of integrity and trust in all
business relationships and dealings, at all times.
In order to achieve the above, the Group has established policies for conflict of interest, insider trading and
 fraud and whistleblowing.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY
The Group has established a conflict of interest policy to guide our employees in identifying potential and or actual
conflict of interest from the daily operations and how management deals with such confirmed incidence of conflict of
interest. Conflict of interest is defined broadly in the policy to refer to any situation where an employee has a personal
interest that is sufficient to influence, or appears to influence, the objective exercise of his official duties. The conflict of
interest policy will require employees to declare real or perceived conflicts of interests in accordance with documented
procedures and to comply with the actions recommended by our management to address such conflicts.
All of our key management personnel, including but not limited to our Executive Directors and Executive Officers, have
to complete annual declaration of conflict of interest to the Board.

D21 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 201&
DEALING IN SECURITIES POLICY
The Group has adopted a policy whereby the Directors and employees of the Group are prohibited from dealing in the
securities of the Company while in possession of price-sensitive information as well as during the period commencing
one (1) month before the announcement of the Group's full year results and two (2) weeks before the announcement
of the first, second and third quarter results until the said results announcement has been made. The Directors and
employees of the Group are to refrain from dealing in the Company's securities on short-term considerations.
The Directors and employees of the Group are also required to adhere to the provisions of the Securities and Futures
Act, Companies Act, Chapter 50 of Singapore, the SGX-ST Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist ("Catalist Rules")
and any other relevant regulations with regard to their securities transactions.
Directors and employees of the Group are also expected to observe insider trading laws at all times even when dealing
with securities within the permitted trading period.
|
FRAUD AND WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
The Group adopts a fraud and whistle-blowing policy which demonstrates the Group's zero tolerance towards
dishonesty and corrupt practices. This policy provides a transparent channel of communication for employees and
external parties to raise in confidence, to report any possible improprieties in financial reporting, fraud, corruption,
bribery, and any non-compliance with laws and regulations without fear of reprisal. A dedicated secured email address
 has been set up to allow whistle blowers to contact the chairman of the Audit Committee of the Company directly.
In FY2018, there were no lapses with requirements under the Catalist Rules leading to reprimands from the SGX-ST,
and there were no whistle-blowing reports received.
