ABOUT

THE REPORT



This is Chemical Industries (Far East) Limited’s (CIL) fourth Sustainability Report, covering all Singapore 

operations of CIL as a manufacturer of basic chemicals, in particular the Sakra chlor-alkali production plant 

located in Jurong Island, for the financial year (FY) of 01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.

The report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting 

Standards (GRI Standards): Core option. The GRI Standards were chosen due to their reputation as an 

internationally recognised standard for reporting ESG issues. This report’s content and material ESG topics 

were defined by applying the four reporting principles established in the GRI Standards:

• STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS

The content and context of this report were determined through internal discussions within management 

and engagement with our various stakeholders. This ensures a comprehensive coverage of expectations 

and interests of all stakeholders.

• SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT

Our business operations and performance were presented in the context of ESG landscape requirements 

at the local, regional and global level.

• MATERIALITY

The material issues disclosed in this report were identified through internal discussions within 

management. These selected topics were determined to have the most significant impact on our business.

• COMPLETENESS

This report covers various aspects of the material topics, including implications, initiatives and boundaries 

of datapoints, within the reporting period.

The report also references the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) chemical sector-specific 

standards. The SASB Standards were chosen to incorporate better identification, management and 

communication of financially-material sustainability information. Readers may refer to the full GRI and SASB 

Indexes at the end of this report for an overview of the company’s approach towards appropriate disclosure 

in accordance with the two standards.

While the report has not undergone external assurance, due care has gone into the disclosure of information 

presented in this report. We will review our policy on Sustainability Reporting assurance for future releases.

2.1. OUR

BOARD’S STATEMENT

FY2021 was a year like no other. The COVID-19 pandemic brought on unprecedented effects on the 

world, impacting lives, livelihoods, and businesses. This report covers a crucial period not just for us at 

CIL, but also for our customers, employees and the local communities we live in. As the leading chemicals 

manufacturer of chor-alkali products in Singapore, we leveraged products, resources and relationships to 

help our stakeholders navigate the crisis.

CIL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

At the height of the pandemic, we played an important role assisting the government’s efforts in curbing 

the spread of the virus. We supplied 300 tons of disinfectant chemicals to the Public Utilities Board (PUB) – 

the statutory board in Singapore responsible for coordinating the supply of utilities to ensure clean water 

and waste systems across the country – and quarantine sites to prevent the transmission of the virus at 

hotspots, especially amongst frontline service and medical staff.

Keeping our employees safe was another of our top priorities. We provided five-piece mask sets to all 

employees and immediately implemented government-recommended safety protocols such as temperature 

screening and TraceTogether practices at our operations to ensure that our employees could continue to 

provide essential services in a clean environment. All frontline employees were encouraged to be vaccinated 

as early as possible. We provided temporary housing for foreign employees who were affected by their 

home country’s lockdowns, as well as an allowance to support their living expenses. At present, we have 

arranged for medium to long-term housing options for them.

We are also happy to share that we continued to fulfil customer orders without significant disruption. 

MOVING FORWARD

Amid responding to the urgent needs of the pandemic, we continue to make progress in our environmental 

and social sustainability journey. We share more details on the various achievements made in the section on 

FY2021 Highlights, and more elaborations in Chapter 4: Areas of Focus for CIL. We also look to enhance 

our business continuity efforts to stay resilient in the event of uncertainties. On this note, we are in the 

midst of sourcing for a new site on mainland Singapore with the lease of our current headquarters located 

in Jalan Samulun coming to an end. The new site will serve as our headquarters and as a back-up storage 

and continuity site. We look forward to sharing an update in the next report.

Our commitment to serving all stakeholders remains unchanged and we thank you for being our partner 

to address the needs of our time; we look forward to making further economic and sustainability progress 

as we transition to operating in the new normal.

3.2. SUSTAINABILITY

PILLARS

CIL conducted a materiality assessment with our Management in FY2020 to identify material ESG topics that 

are most significant to our business and stakeholders. Eight material topics were identified and approved 

by the Board for our Sustainability Report disclosures. This year, we have decided to map our disclosures to 

both GRI and SASB Standards in keeping with the best practices of double materiality advocated by SGX. 

Each year, we will look to review these material topics to ensure their continued relevance in our fast-

changing operating landscape. We confirm that the eight material topics remain relevant to our business 

and stakeholders in FY2021. 

We place the eight material topics into four value creation pillars to effectively communicate our 

sustainability commitments – Marketplace, Environment, People and Community. These pillars guide our 

efforts in designing actions and policies to keep us on the path towards sustained business growth that 

delivers positive impact on the world we live in.

Enforcing Anti-Corruption Practices

Maintaining business integrity is a key priority in CIL’s corporate 

culture. We strive to preserve our stakeholders’ confidence and trust 

in us through every business dealing and relationship that we possess. 

We take a ‘zero-tolerance’ approach against all forms of corruption, 

bribery and extortion.

We have a whistleblowing policy where internal and external 

persons can pass on information to our top management concerning 

wrongdoing. The policy encompasses protection of anonymity, where 

the whistle-blower’s identity and interests of any kind are safeguarded 

without fear of reprisal, retaliation, discrimination or harassment of 

any kind.

CIL’s Energy Policy

To achieve our goals of:

We commit to improve energy 

efficiency by:

• Reducing energy usage by 5% per 

metric ton of sodium hydroxide 

produced per kilowatt-hour basis 

by 2022

• Obtaining 2% energy saving per 

ton of sodium hydroxide in the 

coming financial year as compared 

to the current year

• Becoming one of the most energy 

efficient companies in the chlor-

alkali industry on kilowatt-hour per 

metric ton of caustic soda basis

• Implementing effective energy 

programmes

• Establishing partnerships with 

the government and external 

organisations

• Reducing reliance on fossil fuels 

and instead using recyclable or 

recoverable energy, where possible

• Investing in cost-effective plant and 

material upgrades

• Educating employees about energy-

savings at work and at home

i

Being Environmentally-Conscious Manufacturers

CIL is committed to minimising our environmental footprint on 

the planet. As part of the chemicals manufacturing industry, 

we recognise that a significant portion of our environmental 

footprint stems from three areas in our value chain:

1. Energy

2. Water and Effluents

3. Environmental Compliance

As such, we set targets across these three areas and commit to 

meet them consistently. We develop monitoring and assessment 

frameworks to review operations efficacy in meeting the 

targets, which also ensures accountability for remediation 

action to be taken if any gaps are identified.

Reducing Energy Usage

We recognise that electricity consumption from our operations 

can be significant. As such, we strive to ensure that our 

manufacturing processes are energy efficient. Our actions 

are guided by an Energy Policy which applies to all our 

facilities, business units, subsidiaries and employees. This 

policy is reviewed and updated every three years to maintain 

operational efficiency.

We strive to reduce energy usage in three ways:

• Investing in advanced technology

a. We identify and use energy-efficient electrolysers to 

produce two of our key chemicals – chlorine and sodium 

hydroxide. It boasts a low power consumption upon use 

and leverages a zero gap technology in the manufacturing 

process to further decrease overall energy use due to an 

increased exposure of a high-performance membrane. 

To ensure optimal membrane performance and hence 

energy consumption, we replace the membrane once 

every four years and recoat the electrode once every 

eight years. This in turn has allowed us to capture cost-

savings as well.

b. During the year, we modified the energy utility on 

mechanical flow pumps to cater to different capacity 

loads in the manufacturing process. This allowed us to 

reduce our energy consumption by up to 20%.


4.2. ENVIRONMENT

CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES (FAR EAST) LIMITED

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2021

• Adhering to best-practice management systems and policies

a. We ensure that our processes adhere to ISO9001, ISO14001 and Singapore’s Energy Conservation Act 

to remain up to date with the industry best practice and latest requirements. Every year, CIL carries 

out one external and two internal audits, in addition to a Management Review to review objectives, 

goals and targets. The statutory board in Singapore responsible for improving and sustaining a clean 

and green environment – National Environmental Agency (NEA) – also conducts an energy audit on 

our operations yearly, in which we submitted the relevant data for FY2020 on 30 June 2020.

• Engaging third-party consultants to assess and improve operational energy efficiency

a. We are in the midst of working with a third-party consultant to conduct an Energy Efficiency 

Opportunities Assessment (EEOA) across our main operational processes to reduce our overall 

energy consumption by 10-15% by 2025. The assessment will focus on aspects such as energy 

utility, transformation, end-use systems, as well as the interactions between related systems and the 

breakdown of energy use within each system. These aspects account for approximately 80% of our 

total energy consumption at present.

In FY2021, our total energy consumption amounted to 105,441,438 kWh, while our energy intensity ratio 

measured 2.55 per ton of sodium hydroxide. While this represents a 0.4% increase in energy intensity 

as compared to FY2020, it was despite a 20% increase in sodium hydroxide production, a key chemical 

output from our production plant. We strive to obtain a 2% energy saving per ton of sodium hydroxide 

produced in the coming financial year, as compared to the current year.

Enabling Water Efficiency

Water is a critical raw material in our manufacturing process, especially in the production of chlor-alkali. We 

utilise three types of water at our manufacturing plants – demi water, raw water and NEWater. They leave 

our operations in one of two ways, either as part of products or as wastewater. Where possible, wastewater 

is recycled and reused in various process applications across our production chain. These include:

We are currently also looking into water savings projects to treat our wastewater into NEWater or demi 

water, to be reused in our manufacturing processes.

Annually, we carry out one external and two internal audits, as well as a Management Review. We also 

submit the relevant water data required to the Public Utilities Board (PUB) – the statutory board in Singapore 

responsible for coordinating the supply of utilities – to assess our plant’s water efficacy.

In FY2021, our total water withdrawal from third parties amounted to 309,742 m3, while our water 

discharge measured 24,269 m3. This represents a 5.2% increase in water savings as compared to FY2020 

and is a result of our continued water reduction initiatives such as recycling condensates from manufacturing 

processes back into plant machinery. We strive to obtain a 3% water savings per ton of sodium hydroxide 

produced in the coming financial year, as compared to the current year.

In April 2020, we conducted source emission monitoring across seven 

emission points in our manufacturing systems. This involved testing 

for aerial traces of pollutant compounds such as hydrogen chloride, 

ammonia and ammonium compounds, chlorine, oxides of nitrogen 

and carbon monoxide, where results showed that the concentration 

of these compounds were within the Emission Limits of Standards of 

Concentration of Air Impurities, as stipulated under the Environmental 

Protection and Management Act (Air Impurities) Regulations, 2008 

and the Environmental Protection and Management (Air Impurities) 

(Amendment) Regulations, 2015.

As of FY2021, testing also revealed that the amount of chlorine 

detected in our plant boundaries was below regulation limits set by 

Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) at our perimeter fencing. The 

chlorine detectors are owned by us, and results are reported to SCDF 

to ensure the amount is below 10ppm. To share our progress from 

FY2020, we have since installed a new chlorine scrubber to better 

enclose the chlorine filling station and prevent leaks. We are also 

in the midst of upgrading the hydrochloric acid scrubbing system to 

better cater to the increased production capacity in our plant.

Across the year, we also conduct several environmental safety drills. These include:

Keeping Our Employees Safe During 

COVID-19 

As the pandemic continues, we ensure 

that we continue to implement tight 

controls and sound operating procedures 

to safeguard the health and wellness 

of our employees, in accordance 

with guidance from the Singapore 

government.

• We provided all employees a five-

piece mask set soon after the legal 

requirement of wearing a mask was 

enforced by the government.

• We subsidised hotel accommodation 

for 18 of our foreign staff for three 

months following the announcement 

of Singapore’s circuit breaker and 

provided a small allowance to support 

their living costs. At present, we 

continue to subsidise medium to 

long-term housing options for the 

same group of foreign staff.

Protecting Our Employees

We adopt a zero-tolerance policy on safety lapses 

as the health and safety of our employees is a top 

priority at CIL.

We govern Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 

matters at CIL though the Singapore Standard (SS) 

506 Part 3, which adheres to the standard required 

by the Code of Practice on Safety Management 

System specific to the chemical industry. These 

management policies are communicated to all 

internal and external personnel, taking into account 

their roles, responsibilities, accountability and 

authority. The policies are reviewed periodically 

to assure continued relevance to CIL’s operations. 

Before the commencement of new work, risk reviews 

are conducted for staff safety as well as for quality 

assurance.

We are also a signatory to the Singapore Chemical 

Industry Council (SCIC) Responsible Care initiative, 

which requires us to make annual submissions of our 

health, safety and environment (HSE) information 

for industry monitoring and benchmarking. This 

encourages us to assess and update our policies 

regularly to keep in line with industry best practices. 

In addition, we carry out and submit safety 

audits every two years according to government 

regulations.

All OHS procedures are monitored and documented, 

from process parameters to results attained. 

Management teams will carry out evaluation 

assessments and make any adjustments, if necessary.

basis

Relevant Risk Assessment: 

100% completion rate for staff on a yearly 

basis

Tool Box Briefing: 

At least 1 briefing a week across all plant 

operations

We also involve employees as part of our solution 

to improve health and safety standards at the 

workplace. Through a consultative approach, our 

Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) personnel 

engages with employees to collect ideas and 

feedback on suggested improvements through 

avenues such as feedback forms. These suggestions 

are evaluated by a Workplace Safety and Health 

(WSH) committee at monthly meetings and will be 

implemented, if applicable. Additionally, employees 

are encouraged to report potential work-related 

hazards or incidents. In the event an incident is 

reported, an investigation team will be formed to 

investigate the hazard and its related risks, with 

preventive action taken to stop recurrence.

In FY2021, the number and rate of work-related 

injuries measured 5 and 3.9 per 200,000 hours 

worked respectively, across the 256,189 hours 

worked by all employees. These injuries were 

chemical splash related and none were fatal.

Concurrently, we also place emphasis on the physical 

and mental well-being of our people. We provide 

staff access to select non-occupational medical and 

healthcare services such as company clinics or health insurance. Onsite health screenings, health coaching 

sessions and sports activities – such as our annual Corporate Steps Challenge – are also available.

Advocating for Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining

Upholding fair and open employment is key to CIL, having been an early adopter of Unions since 12 Oct 

1982. We negotiate with the Chemical Industries Employees’ Union (CIEU) in developing a Collective 

Agreement (CA) for collective bargaining biennially, which is submitted to the Industrial Arbitration Court 

(IAC) in Singapore. The CA is essential in maintaining that employees at CIL are treated fairly and incentivises 

the company to keep abreast of the latest developments in the industry relating to employee matters. It also 

brings greater access to grievance solutions and benefits for involved employees. As of May 2019, 45% of 

our supervisory and executive staff who have a Singaporean citizenship are eligible to subscribe to the CA. 

We place emphasis on two aspects of the CA: 


4.4. COMMUNITY

CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES (FAR EAST) LIMITED

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2021

CIL believes in giving back to the communities in which we live, work and grow with. We look to leverage 

our strengths and capabilities and mobilise varied levels of support to best serve the interests of communities 

in the markets we operate in.

Supporting Singapore in The Fight Against COVID-19

We supplied more than 300 tons of disinfectant chemicals to the Singapore government to curb the spread 

of COVID-19 in the community. We increased production of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine to support 

PUB in ensuring that the country’s waste and water systems were free of the virus. We also supplied the 

chemicals to quarantine sites, to prevent the transmission of the virus at potential hotspots and amongst 

service and medical frontliners.

Elevating Standards of Living in Myanmar

We continue to uphold our commitment to employ 

local talents in the countries we operate in as a solution 

to raising the standards of living. At present, local 

employees in Chemical Industries (Myanmar) Limited 

constitute 97% of the workforce. Chemical Industries 

(Myanmar) Limited began operations in 2019 alongside 

the Myanmar-Japan Thilawa Development (MJTD) – a 

Myanmar-Japan joint venture company that operates in 

the Thilawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ).

In support of the country’s fight against COVID-19, we 

also provided sodium hypochlorite to public entities 

such as the Myanmar Fire Services Department and 

Yangon Community Service, to disinfect their facilities.
