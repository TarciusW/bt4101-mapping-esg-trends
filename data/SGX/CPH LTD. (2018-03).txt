BOARD STATEMENT 

 

We are pleased to present the inaugural annual Sustainability Report of CPH Ltd. (“CPH”, the 

“Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for our financial year ended 31 March 

2018 (“FY2018”). This report is prepared by taking reference from the requirements of Sustainability 

Reporting Guide in Practice Note 7F of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-

ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist and references the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards, which represent the global best practices for reporting on a range of economic, 

environmental and social impacts. This report highlights the key economic, environmental, social and 

governance (“EESG”) related initiatives carried throughout a 12-month period, from 1 April 2017 to 

31 March 2018. 

 

Sustainability is a part of the Group’s wider strategy to create long-term value for all its stakeholders. 

As such, the key material EESG factors for the Group have been identified and cautiously reviewed 

by the management and approved by the Board. The data and information provided have not been 

verified by an independent third party. We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to 

ensure accuracy of data and information. The board of directors of the Group (the “Board”) has 

overseen the management and monitoring of these factors and takes them into consideration in the 

determination of the Group’s strategic direction and policies.  

 

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as this enables 

us to consistently improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments and 

suggestions to cwchong@circuitsplus.com.sg.

STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT  

 

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our stakeholders and material 

aspects relevant to our business. The interests and requirements of key stakeholders are also taken 

into account when formulating corporate strategies. These key stakeholders include, but are not 

limited to, customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees, and regulators. We adopt both formal and 

informal channels of communication to understand the needs of key stakeholders, and incorporate 

these into our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial relationships.

REVIEW

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

 

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant aspects. Relevant aspects are then 

prioritised to identify material factors which are subject to validation. The end result of this process is 

a list of material factors disclosed in the Sustainability Report. Process of which are as shown below: 

 

 

 

 

The Group has conducted a materiality assessment during the year with the engagement of an 

external consultant, spearheaded by the Sustainability Steering Committee. We engaged our 

employees from different departments, seeking our internal stakeholders’ feedback for prioritisation of 

these topics. Going forward, materiality review will be conducted every year, incorporating inputs 

gathered from stakeholders’ engagements. 

 

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and its influence on the stakeholders. Applying the guidance from GRI, we 

have identified the following as our material EESG factors:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TARGETS 

This is our inaugural report and we are currently in the process of improving and reﬁning our data 

collection methods so as to obtain meaningful and reliable data to track and provide the basis for us 

to determine trends for the purpose of setting targets.  Accordingly, we have deferred the process of 

target setting till later when adequate data is available to set reasonable targets.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

The overall business environment in which the Group operates has faced considerable challenges 

over the past few years and this has affected the profitability of the Group. As we continue to take 

steps to scrutinize all aspects of our operations with a view to improving our operating efficiency and 

reducing overheads, we also continue to explore rigorously all opportunities to diversify from our PCB 

business. 

 

The Group had recently announced a “reverse takeover” for the purposes of the Catalist Rules of the 

SGX-ST to acquire the entire issued share capital of oCap Management Pte Ltd ( “oCap”) by issuing 

shares of the Company (“Proposed Acquisition”). Please refer to our announcement on SGXNET 

dated 22 November 2018. As at the date of this report, the Company and oCap are in the process of 

preparing documents for submission to the relevant authorities for clearance prior to holding an 

extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholders’ approval for the Proposed Acquisition. 

 

For detailed financial results of the Group, please refer to the following sections in our Annual Report 

2018: 

• Operations Review, page 3 

• Financial Statements, pages 40 to 43 

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

The Group expects the management teams in both Singapore and Malaysia to be aware of the legal 

and regulatory requirements applicable to our businesses so as to manage our operations in 

accordance with the applicable laws and regulations in each country. In particular, the Group requires 

all staff to carry out business transactions with integrity and avoid corruption or bribery in any form.  

 

In the context of Singapore, we are subject to the Prevention of Corruption Act, which covers 

employees, public servants and others who corruptly receive or give bribes as an inducement or 

reward for performing or not performing a transaction. The law also has extra-territorial effect, so 

Singaporeans who offer bribes or receives bribes overseas will be liable for punishment. 

 

Our finance teams oversee the implementation of appropriate controls and procedures to monitor and 

detect possible corruption or bribery cases, for instance, the prevention of inappropriate forms of 

payment. This includes, for example, duplicate or overpayments, and payment requests to third 

parties not associated with underlying transactions. We will take disciplinary action against any 

employee confirmed of bribery or corruption or may also refer the case to the relevant law 

enforcement authorities. 

 

We have implemented a whistle blowing policy to provide a mechanism for employees to raise 

concerns through accessible confidential disclosure channels about possible improprieties in the 

areas of:  

1.  Fraudulent financial reporting  

2.  Misappropriation of assets  

3.  Improper or unauthorized expenditures including bribes  

4.  Violations of laws and regulations, for instance, securities frauds  

5.  Substantial and specific danger to public health or safety  

 

The whistle blowing disclosure channels are also available to our customers, suppliers and other third 

party business associates. Whistle-blowers may address their concerns via the email address 

auditcom@circuitsplus.com.sg and the Audit Committee will withhold the identity of the complainant 

and carry out confidential investigations, as appropriate. 

 


 

CPH Ltd.

For the financial year under review, we have not received any report of corruption. There were also no 

whistle blowing reports received.  

 

Our target for the next financial year ended 31 March 2019 (“FY2019”) is to maintain the current 

status of zero confirmed cases of corruption.

ENVIRONMENTAL  

 

 

We strive to carry out our business operations in a socially responsible manner and are committed to 

do our part to contribute to the global goals of climate change mitigation and resource conservation. 

Our environmental efforts’ focus is on ensuring our manufacturing processes meet or exceed 

regulatory requirements, as well as on finding ways to reduce energy consumption and waste. 

 

ISO 9001/ ISO 14001 Certification 

 

The Group’s PCB business continuously maintains both the ISO 9001 and the ISO 14001 

certifications. The certification process allows the Group to effectively identify, manage and monitor 

both product quality issues as well as environmental issues arising from its manufacturing processes.  

 

The Group is conscientious in upholding its good record of compliance and maintaining its ISO 

certifications. 

 

ENERGY CONSERVATION 

 

We believe in investing our time and effort towards energy efficiency, as we will not only help protect 

the environment but also lower our financial costs. The Group’s electricity consumption is mainly for 

the Malaysian factory’s manufacturing processes. However, the maintenance of the offices in 

Singapore and Malaysia where our subsidiaries are situated also account for some of the energy 

usage for operating office equipment, lighting as well as air-conditioning systems. We have not 

gathered sufficient data to track the total consumption of electricity for the Group for FY2018 but we 

will work towards improving our data collection from the next financial year onwards. In addition, we 

have also adopted the following conservation initiatives across the subsidiaries since FY2018: 

 

• Adhere strictly to maintenance schedules of all our machines to check that all parts are in good 

condition, moving parts are well-lubricated, worn off attachments, for instance, drill heads are 

replaced, to ensure energy efficient and safe operations.   

• Regular maintenance of office equipment such as refrigerators and air-conditioners, including 

cleaning filters to maintain cleaner environment and efficient operations 

• Switching off lights, computers and air conditioning systems at the end of the work day 

• Use energy saving equipment and lighting 

• Set temperature of air conditioners to 25˚C  

• Raising awareness among employees and educate them about energy conservation and emission 

reductions 

 

We use fuels and diesel for operating our forklifts and trucks. Regular maintenance and scheduled 

overhauls for our forklifts and transport vehicles are part of our asset management policy to improve 

fuel consumption and reduce emission of pollutants.  

 

We are also supportive of industry-wide initiatives undertaken by our suppliers to mitigate 

environmental impacts. As much as possible, we purchase our raw materials from companies whose 

environmental management systems are ISO 14001 certified. 

 

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

Waste materials from our manufacturing processes included PCBs rejected following quality 

assurance tests, PCB wastages due to panelisation, solid wastes including containers for chemicals 

and chemical waste in the discharged water from the factory. PCB scraps are sold to scrap dealers 

for recycling. Solid wastes that are toxic are separated for proper handling and disposal through 

licensed waste disposal contractors. The Malaysian factory has its own water treatment plant, so all 

waste water from the manufacturing processes are piped to the treatment tank and treated according 


 

CPH Ltd. 

Sustainability Report 2018 

10 

 

to local water emission standards before the effluent is discharge into the public sewer system. Our 

water treatment system is constantly monitored to ensure the water emission standards comply with 

all regulatory requirements. 

 

As for other wastes, we strive to be environmentally responsible with our commitment towards 

preserving the environment through efficient waste management such as reuse and recycle.  

 

Key initiatives which were already in place in FY2018 and as at the date of this report include the 

following:  

 

a. We remind our staff across the Group to reduce the consumption of paper through 

enhancements made to our daily operating routines. Such enhancements include the 

scanning of documents which are then stored digitally in computers and servers to avoid 

overprinting. We also recycle used paper, using them for drafts and internal documentation.    

b. We refurbish and reuse equipment and tools to prolong its useful life where ever possible. 

c. Used materials generated from our manufacturing operations including drill bits and copper 

foils are collected for outsource recycling.  

d. We are actively involved in the recycling of used packaging materials including cartons, 

plastic, strings, wraps, wooden pallets and paper. 

 

In disposing our waste, and especially toxic waste, we are committed to ensuring compliance with all 

applicable environmental laws. There were no incidents of non-compliance with the applicable 

environmental rules and regulations in FY2018 and we target to maintain the same performance in 

FY2019.

SOCIAL 

 

 

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

 

We are an equal opportunity employer and embrace the principles of equality and non-discrimination 

when hiring employees. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion and benefits are handled based on 

objective assessment, equal opportunity and non-discrimination basis, regardless of gender, race, 

religion, age or marital status.   

 

We encourage diversity in our work force, as we believe that by bringing in people with different 

experiences, backgrounds and skills, we can encourage innovation and we are better able to meet 

various challenges. The chart below shows the breakdown of our staff force by nationality: 

 

 

 

As for gender diversity, we actively address any unconscious bias for gender preference and promote 

gender balance. We aim to develop an inclusive culture that respects the contribution of all 

employees regardless of gender, race or age. The proportion of males as a percentage of the total 

workforce is 58%, as more men than women are working on the production floor. There are also more 

men than women holding management positions in our organization; however there are more women 

holding administrative and accounts positions in the offices, as indicated in the bar chart below.

As to age diversity, we value our matured workers for their experience, knowledge and skills, but 

recognize the need to train younger workers to drive the Group’s operations in the future.  

 

 

 

We provide employees with equal opportunities for training and development based on their strengths 

and needs, to help them achieve their full potential. Suitable training is extended to employees to 

enable them to perform at optimal levels and include on-the-job training and mentoring, job rotation, 

technical updates and courses, seminars and webinars conducted by external trainers. 

 

Employees are appraised through inputs from the supervisors and managers, as well as periodic 

formal appraisals. Promotion is based on merit, competency and suitability. As we value our 

employees, we will double our efforts to consider promoting existing employees before hiring for new 

or vacant positions. 

 

The Company and its subsidiaries will continue to abide by the local labour laws in Singapore and 

Malaysia to promote fair employment practices.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

Our employees are an integral part of our organization and we are committed to providing them a safe 

and pleasant environment to work in. The factory floor will have safety risks, but we aim to create and 

sustain a safety focused, zero-accident culture.  

 

At our production sites, the workers are required to operate various machines and equipment. We 

must therefore maintain a safety-conscious culture amongst our workers to avoid any industrial 

accidents. We have a set of safety rules and regulations in place and all new employees are briefed 

on safety procedures during orientation. Every employee is responsible for their own safety and the 

safety of their co-workers.  

 

The house rules include: 

- proper housekeeping to maintain tidy work areas to avoid falls from unexpected obstacles. Workers 

are to replace tools back to their original store area and to keep the aisles clear of products or debris 

- cleaning up all chemical spills immediately to prevent burns and other accidents 

- cleaning and sweeping the production floor regularly and at the end of the day 

- no eating or drinking or smoking is allowed on the production floor 

- wear the right protection equipment when handling chemicals which include gloves and face masks  

- be always alert when operating machines and not engage in any unsafe or negligent act that may 

endanger yourself or others working in the vicinity 

- always practice good personal hygiene, for instance, wash hands upon leaving the factory floor 

- report to the supervisor any possible health or safety hazards that have come to your attention 

 

Each location will have ready first-aid kits maintained on the premises to provide immediate first aid 

treatments to workers or others who sustain injuries at the location.  

 

We encourage our employees to live healthy lives with proper diets and regular exercise. The 

Company provides free medical consultations and medication, so workers who are unwell may visit 

the Company approved clinics situated near each of our offices, or any government run clinics. We 

believe in reducing workplace stress and encourage workers to relax during breaks and to aim for 

work-life balance.  

 

The Group recorded zero workplace accidents during FY2018 and we target to maintain the same 

performance in  FY2019.  

 

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP 

 

It is said that sharing our blessings is what makes life meaningful. Towards that end, we also 

encourage our employees to give some time and effort to the communities in which they live and 

work. The Company helps to co-ordinate in respect of collection of recyclable used clothings, 

electrical appliances and other household items for donation to non-profit organisations.

GOVERNANCE 

 

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

CPH is committed to maintaining good corporate governance to enhance and protect the interests of 

the Company’s shareholders. Our corporate governance practices are set out in the Group’s annual 

report in the section entitled “Corporate Governance Report” (pages 9 to 28), with specific references 

to the principles and guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (the “Code”). Where the 

Group’s practices differ from the principles and guidelines under the Code, any deviation from the 

recommended guidelines under the Code will be duly explained and set out under the Corporate 

Governance Report. 

 

The Board of Directors decides on strategic plans, key business initiatives and major investment and 

funding matters. The Board also reviews the financial performance of the Group, the adequacy of 

effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems and ensures compliance with all laws 

and regulations relevant to its operations. Specific functions are delegated to Board Committees. The 

Nominating Committee ensures the balance and diversity of the Board, assesses the performance of 

the Board and of each Board Committee, as well as the contribution each director made towards the 

Board’s effectiveness. The Nominating Committee also conducts rigorous evaluations of the 

independence of the independent directors. The Audit Committee works with the external auditors to 

evaluate the risk management and internal control systems, review financial statements including any 

significant reporting issues and judgements so as to ensure the integrity of the statements, and review 

any suspected fraud or irregularity or possible infringement of any relevant laws or regulations. The 

Remuneration Committee ensures that the Directors and key management personnel are adequately 

but not excessively remunerated as compared to industry benchmarks.  

 

The Board’s policy is to treat all shareholders fairly and equitably and is committed to the practice of 

fair, transparent and timely disclosures. The Company values dialogue sessions with its shareholders 

and believes in regular, effective and fair communications with shareholders, hearing their views and 

addressing their concerns. Material information, including the Group’s financial performance, is 

disclosed in a timely manner via SGXNET or press releases.  

 

The Group has in place an internal compliance code to provide guidance to its directors and officers 

with regard to dealings in the Company’s securities. Directors and officers are required to adhere to 

the provision of the Companies Act and any other relevant regulations, as well as to observe insider-

trading laws and regulations when dealing in the Company’s securities. 

 

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  

 

The management regularly reviews the Company’s business operations and activities to identify 

possible areas of significant business risks and works out appropriate measures to control and 

mitigate these risks. The Board of Directors set objectives and underlying principles of risk 

management for the Group, and the management then establishes the detailed policies such as risk 

identification and measurement, exposure limits, hedging strategies and other control measures, in 

accordance with the objectives and underlying principles approved by the Board. 

 

On a half-yearly basis, the Audit Committee, together with the Board, reviews the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls to ensure that they are adequate and effective 

in addressing the material risks in the Group in its current business environment including material 

financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls.

BUSINESS ETHICS 

 

We are committed to operating our businesses with integrity, accountability and high ethical 

standards. We maintain zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud and corruption. 

 

We do not tolerate bribery and corrupt practices or any other behaviour that may bring disrepute to 

the Group. We expect honesty, integrity and respect to be exhibited in our dealings and interactions 

within and outside the Group. All business dealings should be transparently performed and accurately 

reflected in the Group’s books and records. 

 

The Group also takes measures to safeguard access to personal data that are stored on its premises 

or servers. This applies to data obtained during recruitment of staff, personal data of existing staff, 

including their medical records and other confidential information relating to customers, suppliers and 

shareholders. Access to personal data is restricted to authorised persons on a strict need-to-know 

basis. We will also try to protect all confidential data against cyber security risks in order to protect the 

confidential information of all stakeholders through constant monitoring of our information technology 

systems. We also regularly remind all computer users to stay vigilant to avoid falling prey to phishing 

or other threats.
