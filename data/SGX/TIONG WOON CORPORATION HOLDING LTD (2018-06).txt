 SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

MaTErialiTY aSSESSMEnT 

Tiong Woon identifies material sustainability matters as matters that have significant impacts on the Group and our 

key stakeholders. In prioritising the sustainability matters, we conducted a formal materiality assessment workshop 

in December 2018. With the assistance of an independent sustainability consultant, we adopt a four-step materiality 

assessment process, as presented in Figure 5 below.  A total of four material sustainability matters and three other 

sustainability matters are identified through this assessment. We will continue to review the material sustainability 

matters on an annual basis to ensure its relevance to our business.

Expressing our Emphasis on Corporate governance

Apart from being a mandatory requirement for SGX-listed companies, upholding high standards of corporate 

governance, ensuring the sustainability of our business, and maximising the value of our stakeholders are of 

great importance to Tiong Woon. We understand that any breaches of business ethics and non-compliance to 

the laws and regulations can affect the Group’s reputation, revocation of our licenses and imposition of penalties. 

The steadfast commitment towards corporate governance is reflected across Tiong Woon’s operations and in our 

interactions with suppliers and customers.

Corporate governance policies and initiatives

Tiong Woon strives to sustain a business that strictly adheres to the most efficient and compliant of corporate 

governance practices. Hence, over the years, our Group established specific policies and procedures that help align 

its business activities. 

Figure 7. Corporate governance policies and procedures

To facilitate the effective management of the aforementioned policies, the Audit Committee is actively engaged and 

plays a vital role in ensuring good corporate governance within the Group.  Regular compliance related trainings are 

conducted to ensure that employees keep abreast of these policies. In addition, all employees are briefed on the 

business code of conduct upon joining the company during the orientation programme.

our Target and performance

In FY2018, we have met our target of zero confirmed incidents of corruptions and zero confirmed incidents of non-

compliance with applicable environmental and socioeconomic laws and regulations.

Expressing our Emphasis on Economic performance

Economic performance1 is imperative for our Group. It reflects the Group’s performance and its ability to grow. In 

Tiong Woon, we place emphasis on the importance of sustaining positive financial returns to achieve sustainable 

growth for the Group. The Group also recognise its role in developing the local economy. We understand that our 

economic footprint has direct and indirect impacts to the countries where we operate in.

Economic performance policies and initiatives

We recognise the importance to stay ahead of the competition by responding effectively to the challenging business 

environment. By focusing more on its core business, the Group is able to consolidate its resources and streamline its 

businesses to stay competitive in the industry.

To explore new business opportunities, the Group strives to venture its business into new markets. This provides 

avenues to gain market share and increase revenues. With the Group’s global network and business presence, Tiong 

Woon remains focused to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance stakeholders’ value. 

our Target and performance

In FY2018, the Group’s economic value generated amounted to $97.7 million as compared to $114.8 million 

in the previous year. The decline was primarily due to lower contributions from the Heavy Lift and Haulage; and 

Engineering Services segments. In FY2018, we have wound down our business in the Engineering Services segments 

substantially. Despite the challenging business environment, Tiong Woon is committed to create and distribute 

economic value across our operations. A total of $98.5 million in economic value was distributed through various 

forms, including taxes to the government, purchases from suppliers, compensations to employees and investments 

to communities. 

Full details of the Group’s financial information can be found in Annual Report FY2018.

CREATING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Case Study:

Tiong Woon Corporate Social Responsibility

Tiong Woon believes that through our actions, we can raise the overall awareness of social responsibility and good 

corporate citizenship. 

Through our corporate social responsibility programs, Tiong Woon has consistently contributed to the community 

over the years. In FY2018, we reached out to The UOB Heartbeat, organised a lunch treat to the elderly from the Blue 

Cross Thong Kheng Home, distributed food for the elderly and donated books to the needy. We strive to continue 

playing our part to work with local communities on various welfare programs.

Expressing our Emphasis on Customer Satisfaction

As a service provider, the Group’s financial performance is highly reliant on demand from customers. The revenue 

generated by the Group is primarily driven by our customers’ level of satisfaction. Tiong Woon seeks to maintain a 

track record of service quality excellence and create pleasant experiences for our customers.

Customer Satisfaction policies and initiatives

The Group has put in place a Quality Policy, which encompasses a thorough Quality Manual to manage and 

support our operations in meeting the needs and expectations of our customers. This policy covers all operations 

in Singapore and is overseen by the Management, including the Chief Executive Officer. As a reflection of our 

commitment to deliver quality service for our customer, the Group’s Quality Management System (“QMS”) is ISO 

9001:2015 certified. The key elements of our QMS are presented in Figure 8 below.

Figure 8. Key Elements of QMS

During this year, Tiong Woon organised a marketing event to introduce new products from suppliers. This event 

aimed to introduce new portfolios to our customers, giving them a greater variety of options and improved 

knowledge on the Group’s service offerings. Tiong Woon has also collaborated with the Ministry of Manpower to 

conduct crane inspections. In this occasion, we invited our customers to witness the inspection process.

Regularly, our Sales Department engages with customers to keep abreast of their needs and requirements. Any 

complaints received are addressed in a timely manner.

Expressing our Emphasis on Workplace Health and Safety

In Tiong Woon, we firmly believe that all our employees deserve to work in a safe and healthy environment. 

Promoting strong workplace health and safety culture has always been our highest priority. A conducive working 

environment will not only boost employees’ morale but also increase the overall workforce’s productivity and 

efficiency. We recognise that it is our responsibility to ensure that all our workers get home safe every day. 

our Workplace Health and Safety policies &amp; initiatives

Tiong Woon establishes a group level Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) Policy which undergoes an annual 

review. The policy has been updated in FY2017 to include the SGSecure initiative. We have also attained an 

Occupational Health and Safety Assessment System (“OHSAS”) 18001:2007 and bizSAFE Level Star certifications, 

reflecting our strong commitment in providing a safe working environment for all employees. Figure 13 below 

presents the key areas in our HSE management system.

Figure 13. Key Elements in HSE Management System

To monitor and track HSE performance as well as to oversee the implementation of HSE programmes, a dedicated 

HSE committee has been set up at the group level. This committee consists of representatives from the Group’s 

subsidiaries and projects. 

Regular safety programmes such as regular toolbox meetings, campaigns, and emergency fire drills are conducted 

throughout the year. A safety training matrix has been maintained to ensure that relevant employees are equipped 

with essential safety skills and knowledge. Tiong Woon also organises bi-monthly management walkabouts to 

monitor and assess any safety-related hazards. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of our policies and management system, an external audit is conducted by an 

independent organisation. We have also undertaken several internal audits at our operations in Singapore during 

this reporting period.

Safety Campaign in partnership with the WSH Council: “The Vision Zero Movement”

In light of embracing a strengthened WSH culture at Tiong 

Woon, we conducted a Safety Campaign at Tiong Woon’s 

facility in Pandan Crescent. We invited personnel from 

the Ministry of Manpower’s WSH Council, including the 

National Crane Safety Taskforce Chairman, as the special 

guests of this campaign. This comprehensive campaign 

involved presentations and lessons on multiple essential 

topics: Securing of Load on the transport vehicle, Safe 

Driving and Fall Prevention when working at a Height as 

well as Hand Safety.

The highlight of this campaign was “The Vision Zero 

Movement”, a National WSH Campaign with the clear 

message being “I can prevent all injuries and be healthy 

at work.” Through the movement, we aimed to bring all 

stakeholders on board in believing that zero harm is made possible by preventing any injuries at the workplace. This 

belief could then drive a sharper focus on finding solutions to prevent injuries and ill health. Ultimately, Tiong Woon 

appreciates how such solutions can improve everyone’s lives at the workplace and beyond.

Tiong Woon Crane Safety Campaign 2018

In 2018, Tiong Woon conducted a Safety Campaign in 

collaboration with Shell at our Pulau Bukom facility. The 

topic of the campaign was “Safe Topping Up of Diesel”. 

The objective of this campaign was to raise workforce 

awareness on the safe topping up of diesel as this is one 

of Tiong Woon’s routine activities in our Pulau Bukom 

facility. As there were previous observations made with 

regards to this activity, this campaign aided in reminding 

employees and workers on the dos and don’ts regarding 

the safe topping up of diesel.

HSE personnel, responsible for organising this campaign, 

conducted a quiz session for the workers, who were then 

encouraged to provide feedback on the demonstration 

of the diesel topping up the process. They contributed ideas that could help improve every employee or worker’s 

handling of the procedures. All employees and workers who answered the quiz questions correctly were awarded 

cash vouchers. All employees and workers were also informed of past incidents and the impacts of those unfortunate 

incidents on the affected workers’ personal lives. Conclusively, we wrapped up the campaign by emphasising that 

employees and workers must remember to fully comply with Tiong Woon and Shell’s safe work procedures.

Expressing our Emphasis on Employee Well-Being

Happy employees are productive employees. Tiong Woon places emphasis on the importance of the overall health 

and well-being of our staffs. We believe that ensuring their wellness is critical to support them in reaching their 

best potentials and driving our business forward.  The Group also strives to provide the workforce with competitive 

employment benefits to motivate and retain employees, which will support the Group’s business growth.

Employee Well-Being policies and initiatives

The Group provides essential employment benefits and welfare to our dedicated employees. These benefits are 

outlined in the Group’s Human Resources (“HR”) manual. All employees are covered with health care benefits such 

as hospitalisation and surgical insurance plan,  critical illness insurance plan, medical care and dental care. Personal 

Accident Insurance Policy and Workmen Compensation Policies with disability/invalidity coverage are also provided. 

All our staffs are entitled to various leaves such as annual, parental, compassionate, marriage and examination 

leaves.

To promote the overall well-being of our employees and raise awareness on the topic, Tiong Woon has established 

a sports and wellness club which organises various recreation activities as well as health and wellness seminars. 

Our building in Singapore is equipped with gym facilities where employees can exercise regularly and participate in 

classes which are taught by certified instructors. In addition, a recreation lounge with karaoke system is created for 

employees to relax and promote team bonding.

Employee Get-Together Sessions

To foster stronger employee bonding across organisations, Tiong Woon organised various get-together activities 

during the reporting year. From special occasion celebrations such as Chinese New Year (“CNY”), Mid-Autumn 

Festival and Christmas to more casual events such as Durian Party, we strive to provide more opportunities for our 

employees to interact with one another across different departments and subsidiaries. During these sessions, we 

also incorporated team building games to infuse fun and creativity as well as strengthen collaboration among our 

employees. 

Case Study:

Dormitory for Foreign Workers

We believe that providing clean and comfortable living spaces 

for our foreign workers is essential in supporting their overall 

well-being. 

To this end, Tiong Woon has built and now operates a MOM-

approved secondary foreign worker dormitory strategically 

located adjacent to our headquarter and operational base at 

15 Pandan Crescent.

In addition to our stated objectives above, this initiative has 

also allowed us to successfully eliminate daily commute time 

for many members of our workforce, providing more time for 

rest and recreational activities.

Standing seven levels tall with lifts access to every level, all 43 fully 

furnished air-conditioned rooms come with beds, personal lockers, 

electric fans and HEPA air filters. Common bathrooms, toilets, laundry 

machines and free Wi-Fi access are available at every level as well.  

Residents enjoy 24-hour biometric access, indoor and outdoor 

recreational areas and the convenience of a mini market located at 

the ground floor of the facility.

The dormitory is also very popular among the neighbouring 

companies along Pandan Crescent and is home to many foreign 

workers working within the vicinity.

Expressing our Emphasis on Talent development

Our people are our greatest assets. Investing in learning and development programmes for our workers enable us to 

equip them with the right skills and expertise to fulfil their critical roles and responsibilities across the organisation. 

Tiong Woon understands that developing and growing our workforce’s skillsets and knowledge will eventually 

contribute to the long-term success of the Group.

Talent development policies and initiatives

Talent development and engagement are vital to building internal capabilities in the competitive markets we are in. 

The Group believes that capitalising on our employees will improve talent retention and reduce its turnover across 

our operations.

Tiong Woon maintains learning and development procedures which serve as guidelines to manage talent 

development and employee training across its operations. The Group has established several in-house and external 

training programmes, which mainly focus on soft skills and safety training. For new joiners or less experienced 

workers, Tiong Woon also provides mentorship programmes to help them accelerate their learning process.

Annual performance appraisals are conducted to assess employees’ performance. A face-to-face meeting will be held 

between employees and their respective head of departments to discuss their job performance, including the areas 

of responsibilities and improvements. This process is guided by the performance management procedure adopted 

by the Group.

Mentorship Programme

At Tiong Woon, we recognise the importance of mentorship 

programme. We believe that attaching new employees to 

a more experienced employee can help to improve their 

learning process, develop their technical expertise, and ease 

their onboarding progress. Mentors are expected to provide 

guidance not only on the day-to-day job but also on the 

mentee’s career development. With this program, we aim to 

promote a learning culture in the company as well as to foster a 

stronger bond between new employees with the organisation.

Mentorship also forms part of our career development for 

our crane operators. Crane operators will be attached to 

senior mentors to learn the operation and understand the 

technicalities of bigger capacity cranes or cranes of differing 

models and makes. This mentorship program enables our 

crane operators to be versatile in their competency level.

CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

EnErgY EFFiCiEnCY and gHg EMiSSionS

Expressing Our Emphasis on Energy Efficiency

Energy cost – from electricity and fuel consumption – make up a considerable portion of our operating cost. The 

Group translates energy efficiency initiatives as an opportunity to lessen our expenses, thereby improving our 

profitability. The Group also understands that the reduction of energy consumption in its operations reflects the 

Group contribution to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (“GHG”).

Energy Efficiency Policies and Initiatives

In Tiong Woon, we embark on a phased approach to manage our energy consumption and environmental impacts. 

We take a reasonable approach to improving our environmental performance gradually. The Group’s energy 

consumption comprises a mix of fuel consumption and electricity usage from the grid. 

In a bid to reduce fuel consumption, the Group commits to only purchase new equipment with a more fuel-

efficient operation for fleet renewal. The Group uses AdBlue, a mixture of urea and deionised water, to eliminate 

the emission of nitrogen oxides when used in conjunction with specific catalytic reduction systems, making 

vehicles more environmentally-friendly. Figure 20 below summarises our key sustainable practices to reduce fuel 

consumption.

Figure 20. Key Sustainable practices to reduce Fuel Consumption

The electricity consumption mainly comes from our two operating estates in Singapore. Across these two estates, 

several meters are installed to give better insight into the energy consumption in the compounds. The Estate 

Management Team is responsible for tracking the energy consumption and implementing energy efficiency 

initiatives by installing timers for selected lighting circuits and the replacing of broken lamps with LED lights.

our Target and performance

In FY2018, Tiong Woon consumed a total of 43,949 GJ of fuel and 1,475 MWh of electricity which translates to 5,308 

GJ of electrical energy. Both energy consumption has increased as compared to FY2017, with a 1.6% increase in fuel 

consumption and a 14.4% increase in electrical usage.

TIONG WOON CORPORATION HOLDING LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

The fuel was mainly consumed by heavy lift and haulage equipment, tugboats, barges, and other supporting 

vehicles. The increase in fuel consumption was primarily attributed to the increasing utilisation of cranes and other 

supporting vehicles during the reporting period. Tiong Woon’s fuel consumption and direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions 

are presented in Figure 21 below.

Figure 21. direct Energy Consumption and intensity and direct (Scope 1) gHg Emissions and intensity

The electrical energy consumption is derived from grid electricity. The electricity is mainly utilised by tenants, 

workshop, offices, air conditioning unit, dormitory and jetty. During this reporting period, the increase in electricity 

consumption is primarily due to the rise in electrical usage by the tenants. The electrical energy consumption and 

indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions are presented in Figure 22 below.

Case Study:

Electricity Reduction Initiatives

Occupying a Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) of more than 48,000 

square meters and standing approximately 60 meters tall, our 

facility, conveniently located at 15 Pandan Crescent, has served 

as headquarter and operational base for Tiong Woon since its 

completion in January 2016. 

Within minutes away from major expressways and the seaport, the 

facility is well received by the logistics industry and enjoys a high 

occupancy rate.  

Up to 70% of available GFA is fully utilised by various Tiong Woon’s 

subsidiaries, and the remaining 30% of GFA is leased out to tenants. 

With high occupancy and rising electrical costs, Tiong Woon 

conducted a study to reduce electrical consumption in common 

areas. Data analysis were executed on the following implementation:

• 

Install timers to lights at the rooftop area. 

• 

Reconfigure installed lightings at the ramps to allow turn-on 

using alternate loops.

Results from the energy saving initiatives were encouraging, with 

electrical consumption savings of up to 10,000 kWh were achieved 

monthly,  translating into $2.4/kWh savings annually on electricity 

costs for common areas. The electrical consumption analysis is 

presented in Figure 23 below.
