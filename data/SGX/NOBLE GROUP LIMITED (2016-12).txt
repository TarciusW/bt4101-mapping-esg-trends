About Noble Group

102-1, 102-2, 102-4, 102-5, 102-6, 102-7, 102-9

Since taking on our new roles 

in the late spring of 2016, we 

have continued to ensure our 

entrepreneurial culture is aligned 

with the highest standards of 

integrity, while sustainability 

remains embedded into our core 

businesses. As a testament to 

Noble’s sustainability performance, 

the Group has been included in all 

four constituent lists of the newly 

launched Singapore Exchange 

Sustainability Indices. 

 As a Group, we have had a busy 

year repositioning the firm to focus 

on key activities, rationalising our 

cost base and raising liquidity to 

drive growth. The steps necessary 

to achieve these goals have been 

challenging, especially for the 

people at the firm, but the resilience 

and resolve of our colleagues has 

been exceptional. We are building 

momentum for future success

and have exceeded our targets on

capital raising. 

We have been a signatory to the 

UN Global Compact since 2010, 

and continue to reaffirm Noble’s 

commitment to the 10 principles 

on human rights, labour standards, 

environmental protection and anti-

corruption, principles that remain 

at the core of Noble’s approach 

to how we conduct business. We 

are mindful that Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) 

factors, or sustainability criteria, 

are increasingly used as inputs 

in the investment decisions of 

professionally managed assets.

We work relentlessly to bring these 

commitments to life, ensuring 

that we create value for all our 

stakeholders, while we also

continue to seek and value 

constructive feedback.

In our sourcing regions, we 

pave the way towards sustainable 

economic development. We promote 

prosperity through creating decent 

jobs and address inequality by 

improving access to quality education 

and healthcare services. Additionally, 

worthwhile community initiatives 

receive multi-year philanthropic 

support from the Noble Foundation. 

Our programmes resonate with 

the vision of the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals, 

which call for concerted efforts 

towards building an inclusive, 

sustainable and resilient future 

for people and for the planet. For 

example, our multi-year community 

plans in Jamaica, Australia and 

Indonesia have been tailored to 

support development in rural areas. 

These efforts also strengthen our 

relationships with local communities. 

We remain committed to building 

on the ten UN Global Compact 

pillars in the coming years, and 

to contributing to the Sustainable 

Development Goals.

Noble Group (SGX: N21) is a leading 

supply chain manager: we buy physical 

commodities and transform them into 

customised, consumable products 

that meet the requirements of our 

customers through (1) our logistics and 

transportation services (2) our price 

risk management and hedging services 

(3) our processing and blending 

capabilities and (4) our structured and 

trade financing solutions.

Headquartered in Hong Kong, 

our core strategy is to be the best 

company in the world at moving 

physical commodities from global 

producer networks to the consumer 

and managing the market, credit, 

and operational risk associated with 

that process. Comprehensive due 

diligence ensures that our trading 

activities are fully compliant with all 

applicable economic sanctions laws.

We seek to be partners rather 

than competitors with our producers, 

customers and investors alike. Our 

most valuable asset is our network 

of relationships with producers, 

consumer customers and our people 

who provide value-added services to 

our customers and clients. 

Our objective is to build long 

term value for our shareholders, 

partners, customers and employee, 

with sustainable focused franchises 

built upon long term producer and 

customer relationships.

About This Report

102-46, 102-50, 102-52

External Assurance

102-54, 102-56

This Sustainability Report provides 

an annual update on important non-

financial topics within the Group’s 

global operations and majority owned 

subsidiaries for the calendar year ending 

31 December 2016. 

Minority investments and associated 

companies that are not consolidated 

in the Group’s financial statements are 

excluded from the statistical summaries 

provided in this report. The Group has 

limited control over these operations. 

However, these relationships are covered 

in our broader responsibility programmes, 

through product stewardship processes, 

pre-investment due diligence and supplier 

policies and standards. 

This report has been prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. 

The report was submitted to the GRI 

Materiality Disclosures Service which 

verifies that the General Disclosures 

GRI 102-40 to GRI 102-49 from the GRI 

Standards are correctly located in both 

the GRI Content Index and the text in 

this report. This report also complies 

with the Singapore Stock Exchange’s 

securities trading listing rules 711A and 

711B, which will come into force for the 

2017-2018 reporting period.

Performance data is accompanied 

by a brief description of our policies and 

management systems, as well as our 

activities and their impact on our day-to-

day business. This year we have aligned 

our sustainability reporting cycle to our 

annual reporting.

This report serves multiple 

communication functions. It 

enhances our internal efforts towards 

transparency and disclosure and 

supports communication with many of 

our external stakeholders. This includes 

many of our shareholders and banks 

that have aligned themselves with the 

Principles for Responsible Investment 

and the Equator Principles and seeks 

to understand the way in which Noble 

addresses environmental, social, and 

governance matters. The report also 

serves as our annual Communication 

On Progress (COP), as required by the 

United Nations Global Compact.

Understanding Our Responsibility 

102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44

Our approach to responsible business 

is fostered by our desire to understand 

the concerns and expectations of our 

key stakeholders. Throughout our 

supply chain operations, we maintain 

a constructive dialogue with our 

stakeholders across a spectrum of 

topics to improve decision making and 

the accountability of our partnerships. 

We endeavour to grow our business, 

and at the same time, drive economic 

and social progress by moving 

essential materials to where they 

are needed, whilst managing 

the complexity of the process. 

It is our responsibility to create 

long-term value for shareholders, 

which cannot be achieved without 

balancing the myriad interests of our 

customers, banks, employees and the 

communities we impact.

Shareholders invest in Noble’s 

recognised track record, commodity 

market insights and robust governance 

and risk management systems. 

The Board welcomes the views of 

shareholders on matters affecting 

the Company, either at shareholders’ 

meetings, or on an ad hoc basis. 

Queries may be raised with the 

Director, Corporate Affairs via 

the Company’s website. There are 

regular meetings with investors, fund 

managers and analysts, and quarterly 

conference calls which are entirely 

open to anyone who wishes to use the 

publicised toll free numbers.

Banks benefit from our high 

compliance standards and best 

practice risk management systems 

when providing us services. Banks 

enable Noble to secure stable and 

flexible financing directly and through 

syndicated prepayment facilities, 

We seek to provide reliable information 

on sustainability to our intended readers 

and use an external assurance process 

to support our efforts. Internally, these 

reviews have assisted us to improve the 

robustness and completeness of our 

reporting practices.

The Board requested the Group’s 

external auditor to review the annual 

sustainability report. Hence, Ernst 

&amp; Young has provided independent 

assurance on our sustainability data 

and disclosure for this report, which 

has been compiled in accordance 

with the “Core Option” of the GRI 

Sustainability Reporting Standards. 

A copy of Ernst &amp; Young’s assurance 

statement is on page 31-32. 

The focus on reporting the most 

relevant matters has led us to identify 

and prioritise topics that are core to our 

business and key stakeholders. 

In addition, the company’s greenhouse 

gas emissions figures for year 2016 were 

independently verified by TÜV Nord 

according to the ISO 14064 standard.

co-financing and project finance. Our 

extensive relationships with a diverse 

group of banks in different markets 

allow us to maintain adequate liquidity 

in challenging periods and to invest in 

new opportunities as they arise. 

Customers and suppliers 

partner with Noble because of our 

understanding of their requirements 

and needs. Supported by our 

customer-focused culture and global 

supply networks, we engage with 

our customers on a daily basis. The 

formation of strategic marketing 

agreements between Noble and joint 

venture partners delivers competitive 

advantages. Ensuring a smooth 

flow of products and capability to 

deliver a diverse range of products 

is vital to the goal of building long-

term relationships across our global 

customer and supplier bases.  

Governments and regulators 

set the legislative frameworks and 

statutory requirements for our sector, 

covering market access, product 

flows, labour and environmental 

standards, property rights and 

taxation. Our governance structure 

and Board procedures ensure 

appropriate supervision and control 

over these processes. Where possible, 

our business activities aim to build 

greater recognition and goodwill 

with governments.

Employees share our values in 

recognising entrepreneurialism and 

the benefits of high performance 

teamwork. Town hall meetings, regular 

newsletters and employee surveys 

ensure good information flows within 

Noble. Our focus is on improving staff 

development and performance as 

well as providing a safe and healthy 

workplace. These drive our aspirations 

to attract and retain the best. All 

employees receive regular performance 

and career development reviews. 

Local communities are impacted 

by our operations. Dedicated 

personnel lead relationship and 

engagement programmes in our 

key locations to serve and benefit 

the communities. To minimise 

our environmental footprint, our 

operations follow international 

standards in environmental 

management. We regularly meet 

with our communities via formal and 

informal consultation to understand 

their interests and concerns, 

and safeguard our corporate 

reputation. Close interaction with 

the communities in which we operate 

continues to shape our programmes 

addressing the key challenges of 

poverty and underdevelopment.

Our Material Topics

102-46, 102-47

Knowing what is important to Noble 

Group and our stakeholders is essential 

for us to focus resources on those areas 

that will have the most significant 

sustainability impact. Health 

and safety, workplace wellbeing, 

environmental impact, and compliance 

are examples of topics that are relevant 

to both the business direction and our 

corporate responsibility efforts. 

We undertake periodic materiality 

assessments to identify pertinent 

topics and consider their relevance 

to the changing context of our 

business and key stakeholders. The 

Group’s CSR Advisory Committee, 

comprising senior executives from 

key functions in major locations, 

leads the engagement processes. We 

adopt internationally recognised 

reporting frameworks (GRI 

Sustainability Reporting Standards  

and UN Global Compact) in setting 

the boundaries for reporting, and 

to guide thinking on business and 

stakeholder relations.

We reviewed our material topics 

in 2016 using input from internal and 

external stakeholders, including media 

coverage of our peers and the commodity 

sector more broadly. The CSR function 

developed surveys to obtain feedback 

from Noble’s senior functional managers, 

key customers, analysts and investors 

on the relative importance of different 

sustainability topics.

This report reviews material non-

financial topics, with disclosure on 

overall management approach and 

relevant performance indicators. The 

surveys were broader and included 

economic and operational topics, 

such as financial performance, 

brand management, and customer 

satisfaction. We communicate on these 

in Noble Group’s annual report and 

quarterly announcements. Corporate 

governance and risk management are 

covered in both the annual report and 

this report.

The materiality matrix shows the 

relative priority of the 14 non-financial 

topics that were a priority for our 

internal and external stakeholders. 

The topics relate to four focus areas – 

our people, business integrity, 

environment and responsible supply 

chain. To assist users of this report, 

we have provided a mapping of our 

material sustainability topics to the 

GRI G4 terminology and framework.

Ernst and Young benchmarked the 

key issues raised in external media 

reports, Noble’s peers sustainability 

reports and Noble’s stakeholder 

dialogues, as a part of the limited 

assurance procedures. The results 

corroborated our disclosure on 

material topics and performance 

indicators. The Board of Directors 

acknowledged the alignment of the 

prioritised topics with our strategic 

objectives and approved the content 

presented in this report.

Targets and Performance Highlights

Identifying Opportunities to Advance 

Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) are a new 

set of universal goals and targets 

that came into force in January 2016. 

These goals apply from now until 

2030 and provide a framework for 

governments and business around the 

world to stimulate actions in areas of 

critical importance for humanity and 

the planet. 

As a global supply chain manager, 

we play a role in promoting prosperity 

through trade and innovation. Adding 

to our commitment to the United 

Nations Global Compact, we pursue 

opportunities to solve social challenges 

and advance SDGs that are relevant 

to our operations. This year, we have 

prioritised our efforts on these four 

goals where we believe we can make 

the most positive contribution.

Ensure inclusive and  

equitable quality education 

and promote lifelong learning 

opportunities for all



We promote access 

to quality education 

through 

scholarships and 

teacher training 

programmes in our 

countries of operation.  Our 

scholarship beneficiaries range from 

primary school pupils to postdoctoral 

researchers. Here are two examples of 

our programmes.

In China, there remain disparities 

in educational attainment between 

rural and urban areas. Financial 

barriers for students in rural areas 

exacerbate the challenges they face in 

accessing quality education. Starting 

in autumn 2015, we have funded a 

3-year living subsidy programme for 

39 high school students in two rural 

schools. These students come from one 

of the poorest townships in Guizhou 

and most live in remote mountain 

areas with limited road access.

Across India, we have been 

partnering with Room to Read since 

2013 to eradicate illiteracy and 

gender inequality in some of the 

most underserved communities. In 

primary schools where educational 

materials and training for teachers is 

lacking, our funds are used to support 

children’s books publication, assist 

in curriculum development, set up 

libraries and provide teachers with 

workshops on reading and writing 

instruction. These efforts aim to help 

children obtain reading skills and 

develop the habitof reading. 

Recognising that girls are  

at a much higher risk of dropping 

out in secondary school, we  

have also funded over 150 girls  

in the last two years to participate  

in a holistic education programme 

which includes mentoring,  

financial and academic support,  

life skills training, and  

community engagement.

Ensure access to affordable, 

reliable, sustainable and modern 

energy for all



Energy access is 

crucial for 

achieving almost all 

the Sustainable 

Development Goals. 

As a fuel source, 

coal provides an affordable, safe and 

reliable energy supply that has allowed 

the advancement of billions of people 

out from poverty. However, it has 

significant environmental 

consequences and can cause air 

pollution as well as contribute to 

climate change. 

Asian countries are addressing 

these direct impacts through 

shifting to coals with a higher 

calorific value and lower 

environmental consequences. Our 

energy coal division is strengthening 

our flows of top quality thermal 

coal with low ash and low sulphur 

content from Australia, which helps 

mitigate the impact of coal burning 

and improve efficiency in coal-fired 

power generation. 

To capture the opportunities 

that are arising in the low-carbon 

energy transition, our clean fuel and 

renewables business supplies ethanol 

and biodiesel across North America. In 

2016, we acquired a 100% ownership of 

the Noble Mansfield Renewable Energy 

joint venture to consolidate our role in 

trading clean fuels.

Reduce inequality within and 

among countries



At Noble, we apply 

an equal 

employment 

opportunity and 

non-discrimination 

policy to ensure our 

staff are hired and rewarded based on 

their ability and contribution. Being a 

physical commodity trader, we 

originate trade flows from various 

developing countries and endeavour to 

advance equality through 

infrastructure investment and social 

renewal projects.  

Rural roads play a critical role in 

connecting people to facilities and 

services. In Kalimantan and Papua, 

Indonesia, we support ongoing road 

Our Sustainability strategy is 

integrated into Noble Group’s business 

execution and governance system. To 

track our performance against the 

strategy, we set measurable targets 

together with the global business 

divisions and corporate functions. 

The following table presents 

performance against these indicators, 

highlighting our efforts to drive 

continuous improvement in managing 

our most material issues. This is in 

line with the SGX’s requirements on 

sustainability reporting.

development in hard to reach villages 

by providing heavy equipment and 

embankment materials for road 

maintenance. The improved quality 

of the roads allows better connection 

between towns and villages, so helping 

to widen the economic participation of 

local communities. 

In Jamaica, we are funding a 

3-year comprehensive community 

empowerment programme. Facilities 

upgrade and social renewal are 

priority elements in the programme 

that promote social inclusion and 

improve access to primary social 

services. In 2016, we funded multiple 

renovations and equipment upgrades, 

including at a youth activities centre, 

a health clinic, two hospitals and a 

homeless shelter.

Take urgent action to combat 

climate change and its impacts



Since 2007,  

Noble has sought  

to mitigate 

environmental 

issues in our value 

chains as well  

as work systematically on climate  

and environmental risks across  

our corporate offices and  

physical operations. 

We initiated the Carbon Neutral 

Project to reduce the Group’s 

greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions and 

raise awareness on climate change at 

our global offices. In 2016, we achieved 

carbon neutrality in all Noble offices 

worldwide and printed publications. 

Since the inception of the project, 

we have offset more than 1,250,000 

tonnes of carbon emissions.

We set reduction targets across 

our operations, including for energy 

and key material inputs. These 

targets are aggregated at the Group 

level. Our Group GHG inventory 

has been certified to the ISO 14064 

standard since 2010, as a commitment 

to consistent and transparent 

communication of our climate 

mitigation actions. 

See the Environment chapter on page 

20 for more details.





Our People

Following a turbulent period in the 

markets, a significant component of 

our people and HR activities in 2016 

were focused on Noble’s transition 

to a simpler and nimbler Group. This 

created a challenging context in which 

to uphold our commitment to keeping 

our workforce motivated and engaged. 

Recruiting and staffing decisions play a 

critical role in ensuring that we put the 

right people in the right roles and the right 

places. We value diversity at every level 

of our organisation and respect the rights 

of all our employees. As at December 31, 

2016, our 1,036 employees represented 

more than 48 nationalities, working across 

18 countries. 

The top drivers in talent attraction 

and retention include a sense of 

ownership, training opportunities and 

career advancement. Beyond this we 

have rooted the wellbeing of our people 

in our day to day activities to assure safe 

workplaces and enhance a culture of good 

health. We enable our staff to volunteer 

and give back to the community through 

our outreach programmes.

Our Commitment

102-16

Noble Group is committed to achieving 

Zero Harm across our business.  Zero 

Harm means zero fatalities, accidents and 

injuries, and taking all possible steps to 

ensure the health, safety and welfare of all 

employees and other persons engaged in 

work for the organisation.

Our Equal Opportunities Policy 

applies to every employee in the Group 

and commits Noble to eliminating 

discrimination, harassment and 

victimization in the workplace. We 

support freedom of association and 

collective bargaining for our employees 

and diligently comply with local labour 

laws and regulations in the countries in 

which we conduct business. 

Forced or compulsory labour of 

any kind is not tolerated, nor do we 

exploit child labour in any of our global 

operations. The majority of Noble’s 

staff are office based with permanent 

contracts, hence forced and child labour 

are not an issue in our direct operations. 

For potential human rights topics in 

product origination, you can refer to the 

chapter – Responsible Supply Chain. 

Being able to read and write is essential. In Uttarakhand, India, Noble improves the quality of primary education through 

Room to Read’s literacy programme, which helps build children’s reading skills, and cultivates a habit of reading books.

Maintaining Motivation 

103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Our success is only made possible by 

our people. Capable leaders, along 

with skilled and motivated staff 

are particularly critical for Noble 

during times of change. To enhance 

performance while reducing our 

workforce, we focus on incentive 

packages, fill vacant positions with 

suitable internal candidates, and 

maintain a constructive dialogue 

with all staff via our internal 

communication mechanism. 

Compensation and Benefits

201-3

Noble Group offers our permanent 

employees a competitive compensation 

and benefits package2. Pay for 

performance underpins our 

compensation strategy, which we believe, 

enhances the culture of partnership and 

teamwork across the firm.

Under our compensation framework, 

a proportion of employees’ annual 

bonuses are deferred, and subject 

to continued employment and other 

qualifying conditions.  This not only 

aligns the interests of our employees 

with those of our shareholders, but 

also creates a sense of ownership 

and accountability that is central to 

our corporate culture.  In addition, 

employees in key roles may also receive 

share options, which provide a further 

linkage to the long-term interests of the 

business and our shareholders.

We also offer benefits programmes 

that include medical, health and 

disability covers, pension plans, parental 

leave, and wellness programmes.  In 

Singapore and Dubai, we offer a flexible 

benefits programme which enables 

employees to adjust their coverage levels 

and spend any remaining funds on a 

range of health related products such as 

gym membership or health screening.  

Noble Group operates a number of 

defined contribution plans (including 

mandatory and voluntary schemes) 

throughout the world – in 2016,  

employer pension contributions  

totalled US$7.8 million. 

Internal mobility

Personal development plans and 

practical actions are key to help realise 

each individual’s potential.  Against the 

backdrop of strategic repositioning, we 

are building greater visibility around 

the different career paths available to 

our employees on a global basis.  The 

internal mobility afforded to our people 

is a mark of our entrepreneurial spirit. 

We seek, reward and support a sense of 

ownership among our employees, which 

encourages initiative from all levels. In 

2016, 38 employees took the opportunity 

to move countries and 46 moved to 

different business units, job functions 

and increased job scope. This includes 

multiple transfers to the Metals and Base 

Metals desk in Dubai office, as we seek to 

build out new business in this key region.

Constructive Dialogue

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 402-1, 404-3, 407-1 

Mutual respect and loyalty are key

attributes of communication that

enhance performance and productivity. 

One step to achieve this is our employee 

performance appraisal. A discussion 

between managers and employees takes 

place to review achievements, provide 

feedback against objectives, and to set  

the framework for compensation. In 

2016, we conducted a review on the 

current process and evaluated the 

effectiveness of with people managers 

across business functions. 

Our employees are kept up to date on 

the latest news of the company via emails 

and our internal magazine – Noble 

World. We gather feedback through town 

hall meetings in the major offices and 

provide opportunities for employees 

to directly interact with the senior 

management team.

102-41

 

Noble abides by local minimum 

notice requirements for informing 

employees when there are significant 

changes in our operations. We honestly 

engage with our staff to agree on 

alternatives or severance packages. 

Noble’s Code of Conduct embraces our 

employees’ right to exercise freedom of 

association and to have representation 

of their choice. As of 2016, most of our 

workforce was not covered by specific 

collective bargaining agreements. 

Building a balanced team

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 406-1

Our people work across multiple 

functions, locations and languages. With 

1,036 employees, our diverse workforce 

represents 48 nationalities across 18 

countries. A culture of diversity and 

equal opportunities is one of our greatest 

strengths and allows us to operate 

cohesively across borders and businesses. 

We have clear policies on equal 

opportunity to enhance diversity and 

promote inclusiveness. It is a strategic 

decision for our business to provide 

a workplace culture that embraces 

different cultures, ethnicities, genders 

and backgrounds. Permanent employees 

represented 99% of our workforce. 

Female representation was 37% in our 

global offices (2015: 35%) and 34% of our 

overall workforce.

Our people managers are responsible 

for ensuring that the Equal Opportunities 

Policy and other labour principles are 

adhered to in their departments. In our 

offices, employees receive mandatory 

training on workplace conduct and 

business ethics. We encourage and 

promote procedures for reporting any 

unwelcome attitudes in the workplace. 

Moreover, Noble takes any alleged breach

Noble Americas 

Wellness Program 

The Noble Americas Wellness Program is in its third year and 

going strong. Launched in 2014, the Program encourages Noble 

Americas Corp. employees to understand that health is their 

greatest asset. 

By participating in an annual biometric screening, 

employees learn “their numbers” in five health risk factors: 

body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood glucose, 

triglycerides and HDL (“good”) cholesterol. Awareness of these 

numbers is the first step for employees to maintain and monitor 

their health. The second step is taking action to improve or 

maintain their biometric screening results.

In March 2016, 115 employees in the US and Canada 

participated in the Noble Americas Fitness Challenge. The goal 

of the challenge was to walk 10,000 steps a day. Any employee 

who hit the goal 5 days out of a week was entered into a weekly 

raffle.  Five employees hit the 10,000 steps a day goal every day 

of the month and a trophy was awarded to the San Diego office, 

who had the highest number of average steps per employee.

New for 2017, we have included spouses in the biometric 

screening process. Any spouse who is enrolled in Noble’s 

Medical Benefits for 2017, is encouraged to participate in 

the Noble Americas Wellness Program by taking a baseline 

biometric screening. So far, we have 99% of enrolled spouses 

participate in the program. 

Overall, both Noble Americas Corp. employees and spouses 

are an extremely healthy group, and 92.8% of those who were 

screened have at least 3 of the 5 health risk factors in the 

healthy range.

of discrimination in any location.

We prioritise recruiting and 

developing local talent. By doing so, we 

bring in local knowledge that is crucial 

for our business growth and contribute 

human capital development in our 

operating locations. More than 81% of 

our new hires with known birth region in

Talent Acquisition and 

Development

103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Our award winning Global Associate 

Programme attracts the best graduates 

from universities around the world. 

Many of the alumni from previous 

years are quickly advancing through 

the organisation. We embed leadership 

development as a part of our 

succession planning.

The real strength of the programme 

comes from the dedicated support and 

input we receive from Noble’s managers, 

including associate selection, mentoring 

and development. Associates take part 

in multiple, in-house training activities, 

assignments and on-the-job rotations. 

The programme offers extensive insights 

into commodities markets, global supply 

chains and risk management.

To support personal and career 

development, our comprehensive review 

and succession planning initiatives 

cover key leadership roles and top tiers 

of the senior management team across 

the Group. We reward the loyalty of our 

employees by providing long service 

awards to honour their many years of 

service to the company.

The turnover rate in 2016 reflected a 

challenging year for Noble in which, we 

repositioned into a smaller, more nimble 

company. As we focused on our core 

franchises, this has led restructuring 

in several of our business areas aand 

inevitably high turnover. Some employees 

with transferrable skills moved to other 

industries, which had a consequential 

impact on voluntary turnover.

A Safe and Healthy Workplace

103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Noble Group is committed to achieving 

Zero Harm across the business.  Health 

and safety policy and guidelines are 

implemented to ensure the necessary 

focus on safety systems at work, response 

to incidents and provide medical aids. 

At the end of 2016, we launched a Group 

level health and safety policy. This 

policy built onto our regional policies 

to monitor and streamline reporting, 

which exceeds legal health and safety 

requirements applicable in the countries 

in which we operate.  Across our US 

locations, we are also helping employees 

to make informed health and lifestyle 

Mobile Family Planning and 

Health Clinics in Kenya

Imagine trying to feed a small family on US$1.5 a day, and 

imagine how much more difficult it would be if you had six 

children and no access to contraception?

Community Health and Sustainable Environment  

(CHASE Africa), a UK registered charity, is working in rural 

Kenya and Uganda to address the complex and related  

issues of poverty, ill health, population pressure and 

environmental degradation.

Their programme provides access to free, voluntary 

family planning and basic healthcare services using mobile 

clinics. These clinics offer contraception service and advice, 

vaccinations, and HIV testing. As a part of the programme, 

trusted local mobilisers are deployed to the area that 

the clinics will operate in to create an understanding of 

contraception and maximize attendance at the clinics.

 In 2016, Noble Foundation provided a grant to fund this 

project for two years. Our contribution has given more than 

2,800 families access to contraception, many for the first 

time. With smaller families and longer spaces between births, 

resources do not need to be stretched so far. Women with 

fewer children have more time available for productive work 

and income generating activities.

Wellness Programme.

For our owned fleets and tonnage, 

the lost time injury frequency and total 

recordable case frequency rates were 1.05 

and 1.42 in 2016. Both figures meet the 

safety performance indicators of our fleet 

managers.  We take health and safety 

matters seriously across our investment 

portfolio. However, the operations at these 

projects are often beyond our sphere of 

operational control. To minimise health 

and safety risks, we partner with reputable 

production facilities in developed regions, 

conduct site visits, and exercise board 

oversight where appropriate. 

Community Outreach

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 413-1

Noble goes beyond promoting an 

active lifestyle for our employees. We 

reach out to the communities in which 

we work and live, helping numerous 

healthcare, educational, environmental 

and charitable efforts to enrich our lives 

and the lives of others. We have a vision 

to work for the greater good outside of 

our daily activities - it is in our culture to 

contribute and give back to society.

Our people lead many community 

initiatives, identifying where help is most 

needed. We volunteer and aim to inspire. 

This includes community volunteering 

schemes such as fundraising, providing 

teaching and mentoring services, as  

well as participating in charity runs  

and challenges. 

From marathons to obstacle racing, 

Noble teams participate in multiple 

events to raise funds for local charities 

and touch the communities in the 

places where Noble operates. In Noble 

Americas, more than 15 charities 

benefited from our dollar-for-dollar 

matching gift programme, benefiting 

qualified charities. We look to advance 

social objectives and build lasting 

partnerships. Regular site visits and 

meetings with local government officials 

are also an important complement to our 

evaluation of community needs.

Noble Foundation

Founded in 2007, the Noble Foundation provides philanthropic 

contributions to address the root cause of poverty and 

underdevelopment. Through collaboration with local 

organisations, we are dedicated to acting at the grassroots level. 

We have put in place a formal procedure to select, monitor 

and review programmes, and welcome applications year 

round from our staff. In 2016, we implemented programmes 

in 12 countries focusing on literacy, rural infrastructure, 

medical and nutritional assistance, boosting local employment 

opportunities and biodiversity protection. To enable the stable 

delivery of services and activities that align with our visions, 

the Foundation generally makes grants to programmes that are 

brought to our attention by staff, offering support over one to 

three year periods.

Roles and Governance 

102-11, 102-16, 102-18

Our Board of Directors is committed 

to maintaining a high standard of 

corporate governance within the 

Group. We take pride in having a 

deep and high quality Board, whose 

objective judgement on corporate 

affairs and collective experience is 

invaluable for our decision making. 

With a total of 13 directors, 8 

of whom are Independent Non-

Executive Directors, the Board is 

responsible for the strategic direction 

of the Group and has oversight of 

senior management. 

The Board maintains close 

consideration of investment, financial 

risks, governance, remuneration, 

government relations, health and 

safety, and environmental and social 

matters. The directors constructively 

challenge and help develop proposals 

on strategy, review the performance 

of management in meeting agreed 

goals and objectives, and monitor 

the reporting of performance. Good 

corporate governance establishes 

and maintains a legal and ethical 

environment, which strives to 

promote and preserve the interests  

of all stakeholders.

The committee structure of our 

Board enables separation of duties 

and differentiates responsibilities to 

focus on critical functions. The Audit 

Committee provides oversight on 

financial accounting and reporting 

obligations; oversight of the external 

and internal auditors and their work; 

adequacy of internal controls and the 

financial risk management system. 

The Corporate Governance Committee 

identifies, monitors and implements 

good corporate governance practices 

and procedures for the Group.

The Corporate Social 

Responsibility &amp; Government 

Relations Committee is responsible 

for reviewing the social and 

environmental issues that affect the 

Group’s business, as well as overseeing 

government relations in specific 

countries. It approves or recommends 

for Board approval the Group’s 

involvement with and sponsorship 

or support of activities, to further 

the Group’s social responsibility 

objectives. The Committee also 

oversees government relationships, 

monitors and responds to government 

actions as appropriate, and builds, 

where possible, greater recognition 

and goodwill with governments. 

Business integrity is a 

responsibility for all employees. 

Consequently, the Noble Group Code 

of Conduct applies to all Directors, 

officers and employees of the Group 

and each of its subsidiaries. The 

Code of Conduct sets out principles 

to guide employees, directors and 

officers in carrying out their duties 

and responsibilities to the highest 

standards of personal and corporate 

integrity when dealing with the Group, 

its customers, suppliers, competitors 

and the community. Our policy is 

in line with our commitment to the 

United Nations Universal Declaration 

of Human Rights and the principles of 

the United Nations Global Compact.

In keeping with our dedication 

to professionalism in our operations, 

risk, compliance and internal audit 

functions are mandated to oversee 

the implementation of our policies

Business Integrity

Business integrity is the foundation for 

Noble Group’s values and operations. 

We implement systems and processes to 

ensure accountability and responsibility 

throughout the organisation and across 

our relations with our stakeholders. This 

includes the structure of governance 

and oversight set through the board 

of directors and the risk governance 

and compliance measures that apply to 

operational teams. We take precautionary 

measures to address key business integrity 

risks from corruption or bribery, including 

investments in IT systems to assess 

counterparty risk and ongoing training for 

staff. We view these measures as critically 

important to ensure a strong foundation 

for the business.

Our Commitment

102-16

Noble is committed to operating 

with the utmost integrity. Noble’s 

Code of Conduct sets out compliance 

requirements and guidelines on 

key ethical issues. Our policies and 

management systems explicitly emphasise 

anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-

trust behaviour. 

At a minimum, Noble acts in 

accordance with its statutory or 

regulatory requirements and expects 

all employees to comply with the law in 

every jurisdiction in which we operate. 

We hold onto our core values of being 

accountable and responsible, which 

extend to our shared commitment to 

prevent fraud and misconduct.

regarding ethical conduct. As part of 

our efforts, the Group has adopted 

and implemented a policy whereby 

employees may, in confidence, raise 

concerns regarding unlawful activity, 

policy or practices, suspected fraud, 

corruption, dishonest practices or 

other matters. Senior management in 

global human resources and technical 

operations implement Noble’s 

environmental, health and safety 

management programmes. This is 

complemented by locally defined and 

asset specific requirements, depending 

on the operating activity of the 

respective business line. 

Risks Governance  

and Compliance

205-1, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 419-1

Noble’s holistic approach to risk 

governance underpins our strong 

risk management culture. A clear 

segregation of duties for risk managers 

and business managers ensures full 

accountability and ownership within 

our risk management structure. 

We have a dedicated internal 

audit team conducting systematic 

audits across all of Noble’s operations. 

Its role is defined and overseen by 

the Audit Committee. The review 

and audit of Noble’s operations is 

a continuous process. The team 

engages in discussion and consultation 

with various operations addressing 

financial, operational, compliance 

and information technology risks. The 

team provides independent assurance 

of our overall systems of control and 

ensures compliance with sanctions 

legislation and anti-bribery measures, 

such as the UK Bribery Act. In the 

reporting period, five audits were 

conducted across Noble Group’s eight 

primary business units.

Noble’s Risk Committee comprises 

senior managers and division heads. 

It meets on a weekly basis to discuss 

significant risks and progress against 

strategy.  Among other mandates, the 

committee reviews Noble’s policies and 

internal controls to ensure appropriate 

procedures are in place. 

In the past year, we launched the 

Noble Group Economic Sanctions 

Policy to reinforce the roles of all 

employees to comply with applicable 

sanctions laws as well as the 

responsibility of legal and compliance 

functions. The goal is to minimise 

potential legal and reputational risks to 

our staff and business units. The policy 

sets out procedures that are intended to 

focus on economic sanctions imposed 

by the United States, European Union, 

United Nations and Monetary Authority 

of Singapore. During the reporting 

period, we had no fines or non-

monetary sanctions relating to the non-

compliance of laws and regulations.

102-13

We pay close attention to evolving 

laws and regulatory frameworks, and 

actively support reforms that require 

higher standards. Often, collective 

actions by investors, companies and 

regulators helps to promote better 

standards of governance in Asian 

companies and counter corruption 

and malpractice. Noble is a member 

of the Asian Corporate Governance 

Association (ACGA) and actively 

participates in their conferences and 

advocacy initiatives.

Precautionary Measures to 

Prevent Corruption

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 205-3

Our Group-wide policies state clearly 

that all our business functions must 

comply within the legal obligations 

and laws in every jurisdiction in which 

we operate. Noble’s Code of Conduct 

imposes specific obligations in respect 

of anti-corruption, anti-trust, anti-

money laundering, combating financial 

crimes, counter financing of terrorism, 

sanctions and fraud. 

Our experienced Compliance 

Team is dedicated to ensuring that our 

business conforms to applicable laws 

and regulations. Compliance Team 

personnel are based in our trading 

offices and serve as a valuable resource 

for providing technical assistance 

and training in the regulatory sphere.  

During the reporting period, we had 

no confirmed cases of corruption in 

our operations.

Noble employees worldwide are 

given explicit guidance on ethical 

business practices, such as conflicts 

of interest, entertainment and gifts. 

Every employee must acknowledge 

they have read and understood Noble’s 

Code of Conduct and policies, as part 

of their induction and on an ongoing 

basis. Regular refresher training is 

organised to maintain the effectiveness 

of compliance programmes and 

highlight some of the perception gaps 

and possible “grey areas”.  

Specific rules on securities 

trading when in possession of 

internal, confidential information 

are circulated among employees 

and set out in a separate policy. This 

includes a procedure for the good 

faith reporting of any infringement of 

the Code of Conduct or other Noble 

policy. Concerned employees are 

encouraged to report without fear to 

the Compliance or Legal departments 

when any suspicions arise.

Noble has adopted and 

implemented a whistle-blowing policy 

through which employees may, in 

confidence, raise concerns regarding 

matters not only about work place 

misconducts, but also any unlawful 

activities, policies or practices, 

suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest 

practices or other similar matters. 

There are also arrangements for an 

independent investigation of such 

issues and for appropriate follow up 

actions where necessary.

Centralised Platform for 

Counterparty Acquisition

As a listed public company with a 

global footprint, we acknowledge 

that our actions are constantly 

under scrutiny. Global regulations 

on financial crime and anti-trust are 

being tightened as regulators place 

greater emphasis on transparency 

and accountability. 

We continue to adapt to the 

changing regulatory landscape by 

regularly reviewing our policies and 

procedures. Taking into account 

these developments, industry 

guidance, customer experience and 

societal expectations, we implement 

internal controls that safeguard our 

operations against regulatory and 

reputational risk.

After a successful roll out of 

the new centralised counterparty 

management technology solution 

and Know Your Counterparty (KYC) 

Programme across global divisions, we 

have enhanced our control mechanism 

by integrating various internal 

systems. In 2016, we reviewed and 

completed due diligence of 3,600 new 

counterparty relationships and also 

reviewed nearly 4,000

existing relationships.

Centralised intelligence 

maintained at a global level provides 

valuable information for risk 

identification and determining in-time 

corrective actions. Not only does 

this initiative increase visibility into 

customer profiles, it also enhances 

customer experience by avoiding 

duplicate requests for information. 

From day to day, our team categorises 

each counterparty into one of three 

tiers, depending on its locations, 

beneficiaries and the nature of its 

activities. Before entering into any 

contracts with new counterparties, 

we undertake a World-Check risk 

search as a key component of our 

mandatory risk screening. 

We faced some internal resistance 

when introducing these voluntary 

processes, but we overcame the 

challenge by actively communicating 

with our internal stakeholders on the 

necessity of subjecting all of Noble’s 

counterparties to high standard 

monitoring measures. Our business 

development and relationship 

management teams also appreciated 

the ability of the new system to 

provide holistic customer profiles 

and to position ourselves better as 

an important part of our customers’ 

businesses. We will continue to 

streamline our processes to ensure that 

they suit each business division.

Ongoing Training and 

Communication

205-2

Every Noble employee is informed 

about our policies and practices. 

Corporate policies are reviewed and 

updated on a regular basis. Training 

on business ethics and conduct 

is regularly held in our offices to 

reinforce the procedures for reporting 

any potential violations. 

All relevant staff are given regular 

updates on rules and regulations 

relevant to their particular markets 

and jurisdictions. Important 

notifications are communicated via 

compliance emails to employees 

globally. Education and refresher 

trainings on compliance, financial 

crime, anti-bribery and anti-money 

laundering (AML) are delivered via 

e-learning programmes and classroom 

sessions.  New joiners undertake 

mandatory compliance training on the 

Group’s policies.

Up to 700 employees (1,330 in the 

previous reporting cycle) attended 

training in 2016. Among these, around 

12% of attendees were management 

level staff. Refresher training covers 

AML, illegal conduct, the UK bribery 

Act, and the US Foreign Corrupt 

Practices Act. In the US, training was 

held on sanctions and trade policies 

from the Office of Foreign Assets 

Control. All staff receive annual 

recertification on their regional 

compliance manual.

In 2016, we complemented face 

to face training sessions with online 

compliance training, while e-learning 

modules remain the major delivery 

tool at our global locations. This 

enables flexibility for employees to 

access training materials and allows 

us to maintain a centralised tracking 

system for course attendance. 

This programme caters to the 

different needs of different business 

functions. For example, front office 

members receive training on financial 

crimes, bribery acts, market abuse 

and index manipulation, which is less 

relevant in other business areas. Other 

training includes regulations related to 

illegal conduct and references anti-

corruption laws and published cases.

The landmark Paris Climate Change 

Agreement was ratified in 2016 and

work systematically on climate 

and environmental risks across 

our corporate offices and physical 

operations. We initiated the Carbon 

Neutral Project to measure, reduce 

and offset the Group’s greenhouse 

gas (GHGs) emissions. We launched 

a centralised environment data 

assessment system in 2010. 

In our Jamalco bauxite mining and 

alumina refinery joint venture, managing 

energy and fuel efficiency performance 

is at the heart of day to day operations. 

Process engineers look at every aspect 

of the production life cycle to optimise 

energy and fuel use. Jamalco entered a 

joint development agreement to build 

a combined heat and power facility 

to secure a long-term energy solution 

and alleviate the impact of oil price 

volatility. The cogeneration plant, which 

will be powered by LNG, is expected to 

achieve significant monetary saving and 

considerably decrease its emissions.

Total carbon emissions (scope 1 and 

2) in 2016 amounted to 2.34 million 

tonnes CO2 equivalent. We set intensity 

reduction targets across our operations 

and shipping business at the level of 

individual assets to manage our energy 

use and carbon emissions. These 

targets, include energy and key material 

inputs. The targets are aggregated at the 

Group level. In 2010, we started to set 

emission targets on the carbon intensity 

of product traded and business travel 

per full time employees. Both targets 

were met ahead of time, the cumulative 

progress made led us to set further goals 

in 2013 and 2015.

The Group level travel policy has 

also been effective at reducing overall 

business travel and encouraging the 

use of video conferencing. In 2015, 

we endeavour to further reduce our 

staff business travel for an additional 

10% reduction per full-time employee 

in 2020. For more information about 

our energy efficiency initiatives in 

chartering, see the section - Pollution 

Prevention and Mitigation.

Our flagship Carbon Neutral 

Project has now continued for 11 years, 

covering all Noble offices worldwide 

and publications. We make every effort 

to improve resource management 

across our operations, including energy 

and fuel use, paper, water and waste. 

Our efforts save costs and enhance 

productivity. As the final step to 

neutralising the remaining emissions, 

we retire verified carbon credits from 

renewable and low carbon energy 

projects that bring positive socio-

economic benefits. Since inception of 

the project, we have offset more than 

1,250,000 tonnes of carbon.

In our offices, we encourage staff 

to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

through making conscious daily 

choices. We raise awareness and 

promote eco-friendly habits through 

our publications and with our regular 

commuting and business travel 

survey. In some of our major offices, 

bike storage and shower facilities are 

available to facilitate cycling or walking 

to work. In the US, we offer a commuter 

benefit programme to encourage staff 

to use public transportation.

Supplying the Growing  

Demand for Cleaner Fuels

102-13, 201-2

Noble trades a broad mix of energy 

products. Our business strategy 

has evolved to incorporate climate 

change considerations to meet the 

challenges of an increasingly carbon-

constrained business environment. 

These considerations include 

regional regulatory developments, 

shifts in market demand and supply 

as well as anticipated changes in 

weather patterns.  

Our Clean Fuels division supplies 

fuel solutions with reduced carbon or 

other environmental impacts. Further 

to a multi-year supply agreement 

made to Egypt, in December 2015, we 

are expanding our footprint to supply 

liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes to 

end users in the US and Asia Pacific. 

We are becoming a major player in this 

segment. LNG has several advantages, 

including being a clean-burning fuel that 

produces virtually no particulate matter 

during combustion and emits less GHGs 

compared to other fossil fuels. 

Across North America, we operate 

our ethanol and biodiesel marketing 

business through Mansfield Oil. 

In 2016, we increased our stake in this 

venture to 100% to expand our role in 

trading clean fuels. The entity works 

with a network of renewable fuels 

production facilities, and its marketing 

and extensive distribution system 

reaches over 200 trading locations. 



Noble understands the fundamental 

importance of managing our impact on 

the environment, as our core business 

inherently relies on natural resources. 

Land and water use, air and soil pollution, 

and resource depletion are some of the 

environmental pressure caused by the 

production and transport of traded 

commodities. We seek to operate 

responsibly to prevent pollution and 

minimise our environmental footprint 

across our supply chains.

Energy access enables development 

and can bring life transforming benefits. 

However, International Energy Agency 

scenarios highlight that countries face 

increasing pressure to secure access to 

affordable energy while boosting low-

carbon energy supply. Noble pursues 

opportunities to supply conventional 

fuels as well as renewable energy 

products to meet rising energy demand. 

Our Commitment

102-16, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 307-1

We support a precautionary approach 

to environmental challenges and work 

intensively to minimise our environmental 

footprint across our supply chains. 

We do this by deploying resource 

management systems and controls. 

Regional environmental policies and plans 

are complemented with site-specific 

requirements. Technical staff, quality 

managers and dedicated staff are present 

in all key locations and play a leading role 

in their implementation. 

In line with legal requirements and 

principles, we conduct environmental 

impact assessments before purchasing 

new installations to manage the 

environmental risks to our investments. 

We also work in collaboration with 

industry associations to address broader 

environmental issues. During the reporting 

period, we received no significant fines 

and only one self-reported environmental 

digression involving Noble Americas South 

Bend Ethanol.

To secure our long-term flow of 

energy products and help our customers 

to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, 

we support alternative fuel development 

and the diffusion of environmentally 

friendly technologies.

1 Noble Group greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory is defined by adopting the operational control approach in the GHG Protocol. The GHG inventory includes Noble Group’s  

 beneficiary ships, chartering, assets, worldwide offices and publication. The GHG inventory is assured by TÜV NORD CERT GmbH according to ISO 14064 standard. 

 This GHG emissions calculation covers all relevant GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur  

 hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). The inventory has been maintained in a centralised environment data assessment system since 2010.

4  Data includes business travel, commuting, water and waste, paper use and publication in Noble Group’s offices

Our world-class corn ethanol 

facility, located in South Bend, Indiana 

began production in 2016. The facility 

meets the surging demand in eco-

friendly transportation fuels with its 

102 million gallons of annual ethanol 

production capacity. We are a member 

of the Renewable Fuels Association, 

an ethanol industry coalition in the 

United States that advocates the use 

of domestically produced ethanol as a 

clean fuel solution. 

Thermal coal with high caloric 

value, and with lower environmental 

consequences remains in strong demand 

in many Asian countries. In our energy 

coal business, we continue to strengthen 

our flows of top quality coal with low ash 

and low sulphur content from Australia, 

which helps mitigate the impact of coal 

burning and improve efficiency in coal-

fired power generation.

Pollution Prevention  

and Mitigation 

While ships are universally recognised 

as the most fuel efficient mode of bulk 

transportation, the shipping sector has 

been working for decades to mitigate its 

impact on climate change, air pollutants 

and ballast water pollution. Noble 

Chartering is recognised for providing 

high-quality, safe and efficient logistics 

solutions. A major component of its 

success comes from our strategy to use 

modern ships responsibly. 

201-2

Noble is modernising its owned fleet 

of ships to meet the growing demands 

of its integrated supply chain strategy. 

Our new ships are equipped with 

modern fuel efficient engines. To 

control and minimise the introduction 

of nonindigenous species to marine 

environments, we have installed ballast 

water treatment systems on 5 ships. 

Related investment was estimated to be 

US$ 2.5 million in 2016. 

We partner with qualified fleet 

operators that place safety and pollution 

prevention high on their agenda, whose 

management systems are accredited 

with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 

18001. We require our partners to hold 

the International Safety Management 

Code compliance certification in 

line with International Maritime 

Organization (IMO) requirements.

302-4, 305-5

Running at a speed optimised for lower 

fuel consumption saves fuel, money, 

and greenhouse gas emissions. Noble’s 

owned tonnage has been, depending on 

various factors, frequently sailing at the 

“Super Eco Speed” and/or “Eco Speed” 

since 2012.  A monitoring parameter 

“Energy Efficiency Operational 

Indicator” is applied across our fleet to 

measure and improve our overall fuel 

use efficiency. Five of Noble’s owned 

ships have Environmental Awareness 

(EA) certification or equivalent notation. 

Likewise, our ships comply strictly 

with the latest IMO regulations to 

reduce the emissions of sulphur oxide, 

nitrogen oxide and particulate matter by 

switching to low sulphur content fuels in 

Emission Control Areas. In 2016, Noble’s 

owned ships emitted 27% less CO2e 

emissions (scope 1) per nautical mile 

compared to 2010. 

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-3

Noble adopts a Vessel/Barge Chartering 

and Vetting Policy to ensure that all 

vessels chartered for the transportation 

of petroleum, petroleum products, 

chemicals and LPG meet certain 

specified criteria and undergo screening 

by external vetting experts. These 

assessments cover factors such as 

emergency preparedness, ensuring that 

an Emergency Oil Spill Response Plan 

is in place to respond in the event of oil 

spills. We are pleased to report that in 

2016 we had no spills overboard across 

our owned fleet operations.

Furthering our commitment to  

be cost effective and reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions, we continue using the 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 

Rating, a tool developed by RightShip 

to assess vessel fuel efficiency. The GHG 

emissions rating, alongside RightShip’s 

safety rating, form a part of the vessel 

selection process in our chartering 

procedures, we also voluntarily use 

this mechanism to rate our own fleet’s 

environmental performance. 

Conservation Efforts

Around the World

We pursue pragmatic partnerships supporting nature and 

biodiversity conservation. In our two Indonesian palm oil 

plantations, our conservation efforts ensure that we not only 

meet certification standards for sustainable palm oil production, 

but also create long-term structural improvements to lessen our 

environmental impact. We are a member of the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and both plantations are on track 

to achieve the RSPO certification.

A dedicated team of conservation field staff conducts 

inventory counts regularly on flora and fauna within, and 

adjacent to, the plantations. The ongoing biodiversity monitoring 

is supported with the use of automatic field cameras and mist 

netting. Information is catalogued in an extensive database that 

tracks species distribution and abundance, among other 

data points.   

Illegal logging and hunting of protective wildlife causes soil 

erosion and destruction to important habitats. Throughout 2016, 

we continued to install boundary markings and informative 

sign boards at the conservation reserve areas. We monitor 

the locations of destruction and rehabilitate the land through 

our tree planting and community education programme. 

Engagement with local communities is a key component to the 

success of our programme. Staff exchange knowledge and best 

practices with local villages to promote sustainability and to 

help preserve traditional ways of life. In 2016, we planted more 

than 6,600 seeds in our two seedbed maintenance nurseries and 

3,300 seedlings of forest plants, while maintaining over 2,000 

planted trees around our mill.

In 2012, we started to support scientific research, wildlife 

management and habitat restoration at El Carmen, a private 

trans-boundary nature reserve along the border between Mexico 

and the United States. Spanning nearly 200,000 hectares, El 

Carmen is considered to be one of the five great wilderness 

ecosystems of the world. It is home to incredible biodiversity. 

In Hong Kong, we are a corporate member of Worldwide 

Fund for Nature (WWF). We recognise their vision in creating 

solutions that serve nature and people, and we are a long-term 

supporter of their wide-reaching conservation initiatives and 

environmental education programmes in Hong Kong and the 

South China region.

A thorough understanding of our trade 

flows enables us to create value for 

customers and society at large. Wherever 

we source products, we believe the 

workers that have produced them and 

the communities living near the sourcing 

locations should be treated with dignity 

and respect. We want to ensure that there 

is no link between our business activities 

and adverse human rights impacts through 

our business relationships.

We take a holistic approach to 

managing these supply chain risks. This 

includes implementing robust due 

diligence and continuous monitoring 

programmes to evaluate and manage 

foreseeable risks and social impact from 

our supply chains. Through ongoing 

community involvement and consultation, 

we tailor engagement programmes 

to address community concerns; in 

particular, we acknowledge the rights of 

indigenous people to customary land. 

We support rural social infrastructure 

and improve access to quality education, 

healthcare, clean water and sanitation to 

benefit host communities. Together, these 

steps help us develop supply chains in a 

responsible manner.

Our Commitment

102-16

Noble is committed to uphold the 

United Nations Universal Declaration of 

Human Rights. The Declaration proclaims 

fundamental human rights principles, 

while at a community perspective, 

the access to public services are the 

foundation for growth and economic 

development. Our effort to prevent, 

address and remedy human rights issues 

is guided by the United Nations Guiding 

Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Our policies set out ethical principles 

to guide employees in carrying out 

their duties and responsibilities. These 

principles require the highest standards 

of personal and corporate integrity when 

dealing on behalf of the Group with its 

customers, suppliers, competitors and 

community members.  

From 2016, we will publish an annual 

statement on the efforts we take to 

address human rights issues, following 

the newly enforced United Kingdom 

Modern Slavery Act 2015. The statement 

underscores our commitment to supply 

chain accountability. Together with our 

sustainability report, it illustrates how we 

prevent slavery and human trafficking at 

Noble and in our supply chains. 

Responsible  

Supply Chain

Community and Growth

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 413-1

When we build out our supply 

chains into new territories and 

activities, the business and financial 

service functions are responsible 

for investigating any past, current 

or potential liabilities and breaches 

of human rights as a part of the due 

diligence process. Alongside these 

reviews, we identify and subsequently 

support infrastructure improvements 

and address basic needs such as 

education, health and wellbeing, in 

order to serve our employees and 

community members. 

In Asia, the expansion of trade 

has been a major contributor to 

prosperity in recent decades. We 

wish to understand the contribution 

of international trade to sustainable 

outcomes. To address this question, 

we participated in the development of 

the Hinrich Foundation Sustainable 

Trade Index. Launched in April 2016, 

the index aims to measure the capacity 

of Asian economies in supporting 

long-term domestic and global goals 

of economic growth, environmental 

protection, and strengthening 

social capital.

In 2016, we continued to make 

significant community investments 

in Jamaica and Indonesia, amongst 

other places. At a global level, we 

have invested over US$ 1 million in 

our global outreach and community 

projects, not including the costs of 

administration.  The 34 programmes 

we support have a footprint in 

67% of the countries in which 

we have a significant presence. 

Our partnerships on the ground 

provide local understanding and 

networks to allow us to identify and 

deliver services that surrounding 

communities need the most. 

Indigenous Relations

103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 411-1

Noble recognises its responsibility 

to foster a respectful and enduring 

relationship with traditional land 

owners near our activities. We are 

committed to obtain their Free, Prior 

and Informed Consent in advance of 

any development. Our engagement 

programmes are designed to respect 

the significant cultural values of the 

areas where we originate resources, 

conforming to our Sustainability Policy. 

Regular meetings with indigenous 

groups in the host regions provide 

an open platform to align business 

practices with community needs and 

expectations. We are pleased to report 

that in 2016 we received no formal 

complaints of any violations of the 

rights of indigenous people.

Social and environmental risk 

management in Project Finance 

103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Strategic investments along the supply 

chain enable greater flexibility to meet 

our needs for infrastructure, logistics, 

storage and transport access. In line 

with our asset-light strategy, we assist 

our origination partners through 

participating in funding solutions and 

using our financial expertise, networks 

and know-how to bring product to 

world markets. 

When we participate in a project, 

we ensure our partners are conducting 

their business in a socially and 

environmentally sound way, and free 

from the risks of modern slavery 

and human trafficking. Our asset 

development team and technical 

consultants (in-house and external) 

visit target locations to evaluate 

the inherent risk factors for each 

transaction. These assessments include 

consideration of risks arising from past 

or potential environmental damage, 

including any possible negative 

impacts on community health, 

wellbeing and livelihood. 

We have a formalised process to 

review and approve capital investment, 

and internal experts are involved to 

evaluate the analyses and consider any 

issues that arise. A typical transaction 

may include the acquisition of a small 

stake in a production asset, a preferred 

offtake or marketing partnership, 

or may involve working capital 

financing which sometimes results in 

an exclusive provider agreement for 

supply chain management and  

logistics services. 

We typically work in partnership 

with market-leading asset managers 

and owners, who originate product 

for us. The vast majority of whom 

are public companies, this of itself 

provides an additional source of 

transparency. We also usually will 

have Board representation and, 

where necessary, we commission 

further external industry experts 

to conduct detailed assessments on

Education and Health Care Service

In Indonesia, we tailor our community support to address the root causes of poverty,  

and tackle developmental challenges in underprivileged regions. 

Support Child and 

Maternal Health 

Service

Child malnutrition and 

maternal health are some 

of the major challenges in 

the health sector. In some 

of our sourcing areas, 

maternal healthcare, 

nutritional advice and 

vaccinations is limited to 

a monthly gathering in the 

village with health clinic 

staff and volunteers. We 

are supporting improved 

health services through 

a programme that funds 

multiple service centres 

in Sorong (Klamono, 

Klasafet, Malalilis)  

and Timika.

In Ipumea village, 

East Barito, we have 

been supporting 

a supplementary 

feeding programme in 

collaboration with the 

regional community 

health service centre. 

The programme provides 

eggs, milk, rice, chicken 

porridge, green bean 

porridge, and bread. 

Currently, 45 children 

and 50 elderly persons 

benefit from having extra 

nutrition in their diets.





In Sorong, we donated a school bus to shorten

Staff volunteer to lead scouting activity

the health and safety, and the social 

and environmental performance 

of our potential investments and 

origination sources. Following the 

assessments, we collaborate with our 

partners to implement recommended 

policies or processes. 

 

412-3

In 2016, we closed two significant 

transactions3  (above US$5 million), 

neither of which required enhanced 

human rights screening as in one 

case, it was a continuation of an 

existing contract, while for the other 

transaction, since it is a greenfield 

project, an environmental impact 

assessment will be conducted before 

construction begins.

Due diligence for minerals 

supply chains

103-1, 103-2, 103-3

Noble trades a variety of physical 

commodities and provides value-

enhancing solutions to our network 

of customers across the globe. Our 

scale provides certain benefits and 

economies as well as challenges. 

Natural-resource use, environmental 

concerns, and customer expectations 

are among the top challenges in supply 

chain management.

As our teams unlock new 

opportunities to secure long-term 

physical flows, we form strategic 

partnerships with market-leading 

raw materials producers and asset 

developers with a strong focus on supply 

chain integrity and sustainable sourcing. 

These collaborations enable a high level 

of product traceability and transparency 

across our value chains. 

Our partners also have explicit 

policies in place to manage the 

environmental and sustainability 

risks associated with the raw material 

production. Those policies are aligned to 

international management and essential 

performance standards. These process 

standards help us, and our partners, 

meet demanding bulk commodity 

specifications and standards. Details 

about our partners and associates can be 

found on Noble Group’s website.

417-1

The minerals industry continues to 

address human rights issues, especially 

when extraction takes place in regions 

of conflict. There are particular 

concerns in Central Africa that mineral 

sales can provide possible funding for 

armed groups. 

For Noble, these risks are relevant 

to our minerals trade with the 

Democratic Republic of Congo and 

adjoining countries. Consequently 

we continue to focus on this area 

of concern to mitigate potential 

reputational risks and conform to 

the Organisation for Economic Co-

operation and Development (OECD) 

due diligence guidance to assure we 

source solely with responsible supply 

chain participants. 

In 2012, we formalised our practice 

into the Conflict Minerals Policy and 

created a mechanism to implement the 

policy. Both our policy and due diligence 

framework are reviewed annually. In 

the reporting year, all minerals trades 

have successfully embedded a new 

technology solution into our know your 

counterparty procedures. It focuses 

on reducing potential reputational 

and compliance risks, including 

human rights practices of suppliers, 

by implementing further integrity 

checks to complement existing risk 

systems. Noble representatives regularly 

visit suppliers, freight-forwarders, 

warehouses and port terminals to 

evaluate compliance effectiveness.

102-13

Noble is a member of the ITRI Tin 

Supply Chain Initiative (iTSCi) 

Programme and International 

Tungsten Industry Association. Under 

the iTSCi chain of custody system, 

programme compliance requires that 

all minerals we handle are tagged 

at both points of extraction and 

processing with detailed information 

on their production profile. We support 

a joint industry approach to address 

concerns over mineral traceability and 

promote local economic development. 

3  The threshold of above US$5 million is used to define transaction as significant. A committee made up of senior 

management executives participates in the review process for such transactions.

Improve Road Access in  Remote Villages

Rural roads play a critical role in connecting people to facilities and 

services. In Kalimantan and Papua, we support ongoing road development 

in remote villages by providing heavy equipment and embankment 

materials for road 

maintenance. This 

includes improving 

structural conditions  

of roads, road 

resurfacing and repairing 

pot holes. Improved  

road quality saves 

travel time and makes 

the areas accessible to 

motorised transport.



Developing rural road network to connect villages to social facilities

Boost School Attendance

According to World Bank statistics, primary school net enrolment rates are 

below 60% in poor districts of Indonesia, while net enrolment rates in Senior 

Secondary education are below 50%. To increase access to education, we have 

provided multiple levels of scholarships to more than 66 villagers. Funding 

also covers schools’ facilities and teachers’ wages in South Barito. 

Attendance rates in schools are often hindered by the lack of basic 

facilities and most children are living in remote areas. In 2016, we donated a 

school bus and table and chair sets to a community in Sorong to help remove 

barriers to attending school. Our staff volunteers lead scout activities at a 

junior high school.

It is our regular practice to include

on 30 September of the performance

did not enforce the appraisal process 

for all employees, as we focused on

Assurance Statement 

102-56

Independent Limited Assurance Report in relation to 

Noble Group Limited’s Sustainability Report 2017 

To the Board of Directors of 

Noble Group Limited 

Scope  

We have been engaged by the 

management of Noble Group Limited 

(“Noble”) to perform a limited assurance 

engagement on the information in 

Noble’s Sustainability Report 2017 (the 

“Report”). Noble has defined the scope 

of the Report in the GRI Index on pages 

28-30 in the Report.

Subject Matter and Applicable 

Criteria

The Subject Matter for our limited 

assurance engagement included:

• 

The selected sustainability 

performance indicators listed on 

pages 28-30 (except for indicators 

under “Energy” and “Emissions”) for 

the year ended 31 December 2016. 

• 

Disclosures on  

stakeholder engagement and 

materiality assessment.

• 

Reported alignment to the self-

declared ‘Core Option’ of the ‘in 

accordance’ requirements of the 

Global Reporting Initiative’s (‘GRI’) 

Sustainability Reporting Standards.

The following criteria have been applied:

• 

The principles of Inclusivity, 

Materiality and Responsiveness 

(“the Principles”), in AA1000 

AccountAbility Principles Standard 

2008 (“AA1000APS(2008)”) issued 

by AccountAbility.

• 

Specific criteria from the ‘Core 

Option’ of the GRI Sustainability 

Reporting Standards (the “GRI 

Standards”) issued by the GRI.

Management’s Responsibility

The Report has been prepared 

by management of Noble (the 

“Management”), who are responsible 

for the collection and presentation 

of the information within the Report 

in accordance with the reporting 

criteria, namely the Principles in 

AA1000APS(2008), and the specific 

criteria from the ‘Core Option’ of the 

GRI Standards. 

Further, Noble’s management 

is responsible for establishing and 

maintaining internal controls relevant to 

the preparation and presentation of the 

information contained within the Report 

that is free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error, selecting 

and applying appropriate criteria, 

maintaining adequate records and 

making estimates that are reasonable in 

the circumstances. 

Assurance Practitioner’s 

Responsibility

Our responsibility, in accordance with 

Noble management’s instructions, 

is to carry out a limited assurance 

engagement in respect of the Subject 

Matter contained within the Report, 

and to express a limited assurance 

conclusion based on our engagement.

Our assurance engagement has been 

planned and performed in accordance 

with International Standard on 

Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 

(Revised), Assurance Engagements 

Other than Audits or Reviews of 

Historical Financial Information, 

issued by the International Auditing 

and Assurance Standards Board and 

in accordance with the requirements 

of a Type 2 assurance engagement 

in AA1000 Assurance Standard 

2008 (“AA1000AS(2008)”) issued by 

AccountAbility. The reporting criteria 

as set out in the ‘Core Option’ of the 

GRI Standards and the Principles as 

set out in AA1000APS(2008) have 

been used as criteria against which to 

evaluate the Report. 

Work Performed 

The limited assurance procedures 

performed included, but were not 

limited to: 

• 

Conducting a site visit to  

Noble’s headquarters in Hong 

Kong and interviewing selected 

business units and group 

level personnel to understand 

the current overall status of 

sustainability activities and the 

report information collection and 

compilation approach; 

• 

Determining whether material 

topics and performance issues 

identified during our procedures 

had been adequately disclosed, 

by benchmarking against the key 

issues raised in external media 

reports, sustainability reports 

of Noble’s peers and Noble’s 

stakeholder dialogues; 

• 

Understanding the expectations 

and needs of Noble’s major 

stakeholders, how Noble responds 

to these expectations and needs, 

and the communication channels 

between the stakeholders and Noble 

through interview and checking 

related supporting documents; 

• 

Performing analytical tests and 

detailed testing for material 


32

Sustainability Report 2017 

qualitative and quantitative 

information on a sample basis; 

• 

Checking the arithmetical accuracy 

of the calculations performed; 

• 

Checking if data and statements 

had been correctly transcribed 

from corporate systems and/or 

supporting evidence into  

the Report; 

• 

Sample testing of reported data, 

performance statements, claims and 

case studies in the Report, against 

the relevant reporting criteria as set 

out in GRI Standards; and 

• 

Assessing Noble’s disclosures 

associated with the alignment to the 

Principles in AA1000APS(2008). 

Inherent Limitations 

There are inherent limitations in 

performing assurance. Assurance 

engagements are based on selective 

testing of the information being 

examined, and it is possible that 

fraud, error, or non-compliance may 

occur and not be detected. Adherence 

to AA1000APS(2008) and the GRI 

principles is subjective and will be 

interpreted differently by different 

stakeholder groups. 

Our assurance was limited to 

Noble’s Sustainability Report 2017. We 

have only sought evidence to support 

key information and data contained 

in the Report. We did not assess 

the accuracy or fairness of financial 

information or forward-looking 

statements made by the Management. 

Level of Assurance

Our evidence gathering procedures 

have been designed to obtain a limited 

level of assurance (as set out in ISAE 

3000) to draw our conclusion. The 

procedures conducted do not provide 

all the evidence that would be required 

in a reasonable assurance engagement 

and, accordingly, we do not express a 

reasonable assurance conclusion or an 

audit opinion, as the level of assurance 

obtained in a limited assurance 

engagement is substantially lower than 

the assurance that would be obtained 

had a reasonable assurance engagement 

been performed. While we considered 

the effectiveness of the Management’s 

internal controls when determining the 

nature and extent of our procedures, 

our review was not designed to provide 

assurance on internal controls. 

Limited Assurance Conclusion

Based on the limited assurance 

procedures specified above, nothing has 

come to our attention that causes us to 

believe that the Subject Matter has not 

been reported and presented fairly, in 

all material respects, in accordance with 

the applicable criteria.

Use of Report 

Our responsibility in performing our 

assurance activities is to the directors 

of Noble only and in accordance 

with the terms of reference for this 

engagement as agreed with them. We 

do not therefore accept or assume any 

responsibility for any other purpose or 

to any other person or organisation. Any 

reliance any such third party may place 

on this report is entirely at its own risk. 

The applicable criteria are designed 

solely for the purpose of the preparation 

of the Subject Matter included in the 

Report and, as a result, the subject 

matter information may not be suitable 

for another purpose. 

Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the 

independence and ethical requirements 

of the Code of Ethics for Professional 

Accountants issued by the Hong Kong 

Institute of Certified Public Accountants 

and the Code of Ethics issued by the 

International Ethics Standards Board 

for Accountants which are founded on 

fundamental principles of integrity, 

objectivity, professional competence 

and due care, confidentiality and 

professional behavior. 

Our firm applies Hong Kong 

Standard on Quality Control (HKSQC) 1, 

 “Quality Control for Firms that 

Perform Audits and Reviews of 

Historical Financial Information, and 

Other Assurance and Related Services 

Engagements” which conforms with 

International Standard on Quality 

Control (ISQC) 1, “Quality Control for 

Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 

of Historical Financial Information, 

and other Assurance and Related 

Services Engagements”.
