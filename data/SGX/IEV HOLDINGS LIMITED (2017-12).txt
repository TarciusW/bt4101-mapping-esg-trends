ABOUT THIS REPORT



IEV Holdings Limited’s (“IEV” and together 

with 

its 

subsidiaries, 

the 

“Group”) 

inaugural sustainability report (“Report”) 

covers economic, environmental, social 

and governance (“EESG”) related factors 

identified for the financial year ended 31 

December 2017 (“FY2017”). 

Sustainability at IEV means providing 

infrastructure and engineering services 

in a responsible manner that respects 

people, their safety, and the environment. 

This Report identifies the key sustainability 

challenges that IEV faces in its day to day 

operations and the ways in which the Group 

has responded to such challenges. The 

Group strives to proactively improve on its 

sustainability efforts in future and remains 

committed to maintaining environmentally 

sustainable business practices. 

This Report is set out on a “comply or 

explain” basis in accordance with Listing 

Rule 711B and Practice Note 7F of the 

Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist 

(“Catalist 

Rules”) 

of 

the 

Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-

ST”). IEV has adopted the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option 

for the preparation of this Report, which 

provides a globally recognised framework 

for companies to measure and communicate 

EESG performance.

IEV has not sought external assurance for 

this Report. This Report should be read in 

conjunction with IEV’s annual report for 

FY2017 (“Annual Report 2017”).

MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

Dear Valued Stakeholders,

Welcome to IEV’s inaugural Sustainability Report. 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) recognises 

the importance of sustainability and leads the 

sustainability efforts at the Company. Identifying 

sustainability risks and opportunities is key to 

developing effective organisational strategies that 

ensures the Group’s ability to improve operating 

efficiency while minimising negative impacts. 

In preparation of our first Report, the Board has 

commissioned an internal working team comprising 

of senior management to manage and drive the 

Group’s sustainability efforts.

We believe sustainability disclosure can serve as a 

differentiator in competitive industries and foster 

investor confidence, trust, and employee loyalty. 

Also, at the heart of this exercise is our commitment 

to work without causing harm to people and the 

environment. We want to do the right thing, and we 

welcome this exercise as a move in that direction.

As a provider of products and services for the oil 

and gas industry, safety in our operations is a top 

priority. We work to ensure our people are alert 

to their own safety, care about the safety of their 

colleagues, and look out for any potential safety 

risks in our operations, however small. The Group 

continues to improve its safety processes and 

has in place an effective internal communication 

network where employees are able to quickly 

escalate incidents or provide feedback on 

improving safety standards. 

We also aim to maintain positive relations with 

all stakeholders and are committed to upholding 

regulatory compliance. These values are intrinsic 

in helping us avoid or mitigate risks that may have 

material financial impacts on our business. In 

essence, we believe responsible companies make 

for more efficient delivery of better business, social, 

environmental, and financial value.

The Group is also cognisant of the need to be 

aware of its weaknesses, and see sustainability 

reporting as a means to gather information about 

processes and impacts that may not have been 

previously measured. Such new data, in addition 

to creating greater transparency about the Group’s 

performance, can provide us with knowledge 

necessary to reduce unnecessary use of natural 

resources, 

increase 

efficiency, 

and 

improve 

operational performance.

We put forward this Report to shed light on our 

sustainability efforts, and we welcome feedback 

from our stakeholders so that we can continue to 

improve and remain transparent and accountable.

On behalf of the Board,

Christopher Nghia Do

President and Chief Executive Officer

ABOUT IEV

Background

IEV was listed on SGX in 2011 and is 

headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

In FY2017, our operations span 5 countries 

in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, 

and Hong Kong, and has a multinational 

workforce of 184 people. 

IEV provides innovative and advanced 

engineering products and services for the 

offshore and onshore oil and gas industry 

aimed at increasing clients’ operational 

efficiency. In FY2017, these products and 

services can be categorised into two sectors: 

Asset Integrity Management (“AIM”) and 

Mobile Natural Gas (“MNG”). 

Asset Integrity Management

Under the AIM Sector, IEV developed and 

implemented 8 services aimed at inspecting, 

assessing, repairing, and maintaining fixed 

assets such as oil rigs. These services are:

1. Structural Integrity Solutions

2. Corrosion Control Solutions

3. Advanced Inspection Solutions

4. Subsea Engineering Solutions

5. Structural Integrity Management

6. Pipeline Integrity Management

7. Corrosion Under Insulation 

Management

8. Infrastructure Integrity Management

For more information on these services, 

please visit our website at www.iev-group.

com.

Mobile Natural Gas

Under the MNG Sector, IEV developed 

turnkey infrastructure that delivered natural 

gas through “mobile pipelines” to customers 

without access to conventional gas supplies 

or fixed pipeline networks. 

In FY2017, IEV took concrete steps to 

discontinue, divest, and impair parts of its 

business that were adversely affected by low 

oil prices, specifically in its Exploration and 

Production and Renewable Energy sectors. 

While the Group was active in the MNG Sector 

during FY2017, the Group wishes to highlight 

that, following the extraordinary general 

meeting held on 14 November 2018 whereby 

shareholders approved the disposal of PT IEV 

Gas, the Group will be exiting the MNG Sector. 

IEV also decided not to pursue investing in 

rice husk silica and nano-silica. These steps 

were deemed necessary to remove loss-

making sectors and improve cash flow.

Moving forward, IEV looks at targeting the 

AIM business in the global brownfield market 

of offshore production facilities, refineries, 

petrochemical plants, chemical plants, 

fertiliser plants, and power plants.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

IEV’s sustainability journey begins with a 

robust and rigorous process of engaging 

our stakeholders. This involves talking to 

and opening communication channels 

with various groups and individuals to 

understand specific concerns about our 

business and its impact, particularly 

in relation to the health and safety of 

our employees and our impact on the 

environment. These include, but are 

not limited to: internal stakeholders 

such as employees, managers, senior 

management, Board of Directors, and 

owners; and external stakeholders such 

as suppliers, communities, regulators, 

creditors, shareholders, and customers.

We gather opinions and advice in various 

ways 

including 

formal 

and 

informal 

meetings, surveys, site visits, feedback 

channels. These opinions and advice are 

then incorporated into our corporate 

strategies to achieve mutually beneficial 

outcomes.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

To identify and prioritise sustainability factors for inclusion in this Report, IEV conducted a 

materiality assessment.

Main Steps in Selecting Material Factors



1

Identify and understand factors that are important to our 

stakeholders



2

Identify factors that are important to IEV’s business strategy



3

Rank the importance of the factors using a materiality matrix that 

weighs factors according to a) importance to stakeholders and b) 

significance of impacts



4

Present list of material factors to the Board of Directors for validation 

and approval



5

Identify mitigation and enhancement measures/targets for material 

factors



6

Review material factors in reporting periods for relevance and 

success in meeting measures/targets

Applying these steps, and following 

GRI 

guidelines 

for 

material 

disclosures, we have identified the 

following as our material factors:

IEV endeavours to review these factors as and when 

there is a change to our business model. If there is 

no change to our model, we will review these factors 

annually.

ECONOMIC

Economic Performance

IEV believes financial sustainability is critical 

to our survival and business progression. 

We aim to ensure long-term profitability 

by taking into account the interests of 

all stakeholders, such as employees, 

shareholders, suppliers, and society as a 

whole; minimise risk by identifying early 

opportunities and obstacles and putting 

in place clear measures that maximise 

opportunities and mitigate obstacles; and 

adhere to laws and regulations that protect 

and enhance employee welfare.

For detailed financial results, please refer to 

the following sections in our Annual Report 

2017:

• Directors’ Statement

• Independent Auditor’s Report

• Statements of Financial Position

• Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss 

and Other Comprehensive Income

• Statements of Changes in Equity

• Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

• Notes to Financial Statements

Climate change may disrupt our operations 

and business. Currently, our AIM sector can 

be subject to weather disruptions, which may 

delay the start and completion of work. We 

have put into place contingencies in our work 

schedule and budgeting that compensate 

for possible weather disruptions. 

IEV adheres to local labour laws, in the 

countries where we operate, regarding 

defined contribution plans that we must 

provide to our employees’ retirement funds. 

We will continue to follow local labour laws 

in providing our employees with benefit plan 

obligations and other retirement plans.

ECONOMIC

Anti-Corruption

IEV operates across different countries and 

engages numerous contractors, suppliers, 

agents, and other partners. This exposes 

us to numerous vulnerable points for 

corruption. 

Preventing 

and 

managing 

risks associated with corrupt practices is 

therefore a material factor.

We prevent and manage these risks with a 

zero-tolerance policy towards accepting gifts 

or favours from individuals, organisation, 

vendors, or contractors doing or seeking 

to do business with IEV. While employees 

may be given tokens or gifts with nominal 

value, such as pens, diaries, caps, they 

can only receive them if the tokens/gifts 

were not given with the intent or prospect 

of influencing the employees’ business 

decisions.

We also have in place a whistle-blowing 

policy that supports our anti-corruption 

commitment by enabling employees to, in 

confidence, raise concerns internally and 

disclose any impropriety through well-

defined and accessible channels. Should 

there be any reported impropriety, we 

have an audit committee that conducts 

independent 

investigations 

and 

enact 

appropriate 

follow-up 

actions 

where 

necessary.

Our 

policies 

are 

communicated 

to 

employees in all countries we operate in 

and can be accessed easily via our company 

intranet. We also notify our employees 

on changes to such policies via internal 

notices and emails. Our employees are also 

encouraged to consult or seek clarification 

from 

human 

resource 

and/or senior 

management personnel.

Senior management in each country have 

been tasked with ensuring the appropriate 

controls and monitoring systems have been 

put in place to prevent improper payments/

bribery/corrupt practices. We have also 

engaged our internal auditors and external 

auditors to assess gaps and evaluate if 

improper payments/procedures have been 

made.

No incidents of corruption were identified 

in 2017. We aim to maintain zero incidents of 

corruption in the next financial year.

Effluents and Waste

There is a risk that IEV’s marine growth 

control products installed on offshore 

structures may, after a prolonged period, 

break apart or detach from the structures 

and drift into the open sea. These products 

are made of high-density poly-ethylene and 

can be considered plastic waste when they 

break apart or detach from structures. 

To ensure better recovery or eradication of 

our waste, IEV’s research and development 

arm has assessed the life expectancy of our 

products and we are therefore cognizant 

when our products will reach the end 

of their cycle. We aim to improve on the 

robustness of our products to lengthen their 

service life and reduce the risk of product 

failure. For instance, our latest generation of 

marine growth control products is currently 

undergoing endurance testing that will 

eventually be certified by an independent 

third party body. The stronger the product, 

the longer its service life, which will mean the 

products will be less prone to breakage and 

less likely to end up as waste in the ocean. 

We aim to complete this process in 2019.    

IEV 

adheres 

to 

environmental 

laws 

pertaining to waste and waste removal 

in the countries we operate in, and in 

FY2017, there were no incidences of such 

non-compliance or sanctions. We aim to 

continue this in the next financial year.

Environmental Compliance

IEV believes in reducing our footprint and 

impact to as low as reasonably practicable. 

As such, we support the precautionary 

principle and aim to avoid negative impacts 

on the environment where feasible. To this 

end, we aim to ensure all risks generated 

from 

our 

operations 

are 

identified, 

assessed, and mitigated to a reasonably 

practicable level.

We have adhered to all relevant Codes and 

Regulations on the environment. In FY2017, 

there were no incidences of non-compliance 

with laws and regulations that resulted in 

significant fines or sanctions, and we aim to 

maintain this in the next financial year.

SOCIAL

Occupational Health and Safety

GRI 400

GRI 403



Occupational Health and Safety

Providing engineering services to offshore 

and onshore oil facilities carries a certain 

degree of risk that requires the installation 

of carefully calibrated processes to minimise 

injury and danger. As such, occupational 

health and safety is of great importance to 

IEV and we have put in place robust systems 

for engendering a safety culture that goes 

beyond compliance to one where our people 

feel listened to, cared for, and comfortable 

raising concerns.

As a basic requirement, we adhere to 

applicable health and safety laws in the 

countries we operate in and have integrated 

a health and safety culture that runs 

throughout all levels of our organisation. We 

believe putting in place proper training and 

effective communication and consultation 

can ensure all accidents and incidents are 

preventable. 

Before embarking on any engineering 

service work, our project management team 

will conduct a job safety induction. We also 

have a dedicated occupational health and 

safety department that ensures health and 

safety practices are carried out across all our 

operations from corporate to manufacturing 

and engineering services.

Our whistle-blowing policy supports our 

health and safety commitment by enabling 

employees to, in confidence, raise concerns 

internally and disclose any impropriety 

through 

well-defined 

and 

accessible 

channels. Our people need not fear reprisal 

for reporting any shortfalls in our health and 

safety practices. 

We also encourage all our stakeholders to 

question and observe our practices. Our 

health and safety management system is 

audited annually and outcomes are analysed 

to generate strategies for improvement.

Between January and December 2017, we 

recorded 4.38 million man-hours across our 

operations with 4 Loss Time Incidents and 2 

Medical Treatment Injuries. Moving forward, 

we aim to achieve zero Loss Time Incidents 

and zero Medical Treatment Injuries at our 

work sites.

SOCIAL

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

GRI 400

GRI 405



Diversity and Equal Opportunity

IEV considers our employees our most 

valuable asset, and as such, endeavour 

to offer our people a fair and safe work 

environment. We do not discriminate 

against race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, 

nationality, or physical abilities. This is 

codified in our employee handbook, which 

is disseminated to all our people when they 

start working with us. 

In addition, we have put in place a strict 

policy against sexual harassment in order 

to ensure a safe and conducive work 

environment. We define sexual harassment 

as conduct of a sexual nature which can take 

verbal (e.g. innuendoes, comments), non-

verbal (e.g. leering, obscene gesticulations), 

visual (e.g. posters, signs), physical (e.g. 

touching, coerced sexual act), and textual/

electronic (e.g. e-mails, texts) forms. A 

thorough investigation is launched when a 

complaint is received and those found guilty 

will be meted punishments, ranging from a 

warning to dismissal.

In 2017, we received zero complaints for 

discrimination and we aim to replicate this 

in future.

We are in the process of conducting a detailed 

analysis of the breakdown of our employees 

in terms of gender and age group (under 

30 years old, 30-50 years old, over 50 years 

old). However, as our resources are currently 

engaged in expediting the process of closing 

down the MNG Sector, we will endeavour to 

to provide such statistics in the next report.

GOVERNANCE

Ethics and Integrity

IEV has an internal Code of Conduct that 

stipulates how we conduct our business and 

practices. Our Code of Conduct provides 

guidance to our employees on our key 

commitments, which include:

We recognise that the creation and 

maintenance of a safe and secure workplace, 

free of risk or exposure to personal harm, 

property damage, or adverse impacts on 

the environment, hinges on keeping our 

employees informed of the Code of Conduct. 

The Code of Conduct is disseminated to 

our employees via our company’s intranet, 

bulletin boards, employee handbooks, 

and regular briefings. Senior management 

is also responsible for ensuring that 

guidelines set out in the Code of Conduct 

are communicated to and understood by all 

employees, and for ensuring compliance.

We endeavour to remain cognizant and 

ever-vigilant of the needs of our employees, 

stakeholders, and environment. In that 

regard, we review our Code of Conduct 

annually so as to ensure they remain true 

to our core values of respect, integrity, 

professionalism, and accountability.
