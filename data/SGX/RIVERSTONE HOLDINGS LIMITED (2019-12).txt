Sustainability Statement 

Sustainability Governance and Commitment 

The Board of Directors recognises that sound corporate governance practices are important to 

the proper functioning of The Group and is committed to enhancing shareholder value by 

maintaining high standards of integrity and complying with all applicable laws and regulations.  

The Board comprises five directors of which more than half of the Board members are 

independent directors with strong financial and business background, providing the necessary 

experience and expertise to direct and lead The Group in relation to overall business 

management.   Our senior management team that leads The Group’s Sustainability Committee, is 

assigned the responsibility for overseeing sustainability and reports to The Group CEO and Board

of the core sustainability values. Sustainability forms an integral part of its corporate strategy 

and decision-making process in achieving its vision of becoming a global leader in the 

manufacture of cleanroom and healthcare gloves.  The Group ensures that the concerns and 

opinion of the key stakeholders are taken into consideration in the course of achieving its vision.   

 

Value Chain Sustainability and Management 

A sustainable supply chain is important in ensuring continuing success for business and as such, 

The Group endorses the following sustainable practices across its entire supply chain.  

&gt;&gt; Group Procurement Policy 

The procurement activities are guided by our Group Procurement Policy to ensure the goal of 

cost-effective, efficient and sustainable deliverability procurement is attained.   The Group 

Procurement Policy guidelines entail the supplier selection and evaluation criteria like good 

quality products, competitive pricing and service and support reliability are required to minimise

Environmental	Material	Factors	

The Group continues to carry out environmentally friendly practices to protect the environment 

for the well-being of future generations.   The principal operating plant of The Group is in 

compliance with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management and we constantly engage our ISO 

auditors and in-house engineering team to conduct on-going examination and discussion to 

independently verify that the applicable environmental laws and regulations are complied with.  

The Group is committed to taking continuous effort to minimise the possible adverse impact on 

the environment.  

Water Conservation 

Water is a limited resource and The Group continues to work on water saving initiatives.  The 

Group strives to reuse and recycle water where applicable through innovation and water saving 

features as follows: 

1) To reduce the water consumption by developing new formulation which requires lesser 

leaching. 

 

2) To reuse the water from leaching to former cleaning. 

 

 

 

 

Water	is	recycled	and	reused	

 

Effluent Treatment Plant is in place to purify our industrial waste water for its reuse and its aim 

is to release safe water to the environment.   In addition, The Group built a rain collection system 

in FY2018 that runs the collected water through filtration at raw water treatment plant before 

releases to the production plant for manufacturing use.  

As reported previously, The Group aims to recycle up to 30% of water gradually year by year and 

ultimately to reduce excessive withdrawal from water system by 5%. 

With reference to the main plant of The Group, total water consumption amounted to 

1,775,000m3 or 0.33m3 per 1000 units of output (FY2018: 1,623,000m3or 0.37m3 per 1000 units 

of output).  

Recycled water from the leaching process totaled to 132,000m3 during FY2019 (FY2018: 

120,000m3).

Energy Usage 

The Group continues to make conscious efforts in conserving energy by using energy efficiently 

and opting for renewable energy in an attempt to tackle the rapid global climate change by 

reducing our overall carbon footprint. We are constantly on the lookout for energy efficiency 

improving means.   We began installing one unit of high-efficient industrial burner for glove 

curing at a production line  in FY2018 which could typically reduce the natural gas consumption 

by 10% compared to the regular packaged burner and would continue with the installation 

progressively upon successful commissioning of new production lines in stages.  

Natural gas usage in FY2019 amounted to 2,084,000MMBtu or 0.39MMBtu per 1000 units of 

output (FY2018: 1,742,000MMBtu or 0.40MMBtu per 1000 units of output), reflecting a slight 

improvement in efficiency  despite that our production consistently requires higher-than-usual 

heat temperature generated for glove curing in the oven system to better meet the glove quality 

demand. 

With respect to electricity saving, The Group regularly reminds employees of the basic electricity 

saving practices through internal memo and daily briefing. We have been using the high efficiency 

motor or IE2 (with reference to Standard IEC/EN 60034-30-1 on efficiency classes of line 

operated AC motors published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on March 

6, 2014) to operate the dipping machine ovens aiming to reduce the electricity consumption.  

Electricity usage in FY2019 amounted to 56,177,000kWh or 10.5kWh per 1000 units of output 

(FY2018:  45,842,000kWh or 10.5 kWh per 1000 units of output). 

Effluents and Scheduled Waste 

Hazardous waste generated by The Group is handled in accordance with the applicable 

environmental laws and regulations.  Policies and work instructions are reviewed from time to 

time by the management to ensure compliance with Departmental of Environment (“DOE”) 

requirements pertaining to the management of storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous 

waste generated from our manufacturing activities.  Amongst others, scheduled waste is stored 

with its movement being monitored by certified Competent Person.  We will only engage licensed 

and qualified contractors to collect our scheduled waste that is sent to facilities approved by DOE 

for chemical or recovery treatment.  Effluents are discharged strictly according to DOE 

requirements. 

The waste intensity in FY2019 improved to 0.24kg per 1000 units of output (FY2018: 0.27kg per 

1000 units). 

The Group engaged an in-house Competent Person with respect to management of effluents and 

scheduled waste.  

 

 








 

 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 | RIVERSTONE HOLDINGS LIMITED | Page 11  

 

Social	Material	Factors	

Occupational Health and Safety 

Workplace safety is always The Group’s main priority.  A safe workplace reflects a more 

productive and injury free workforce thereby reducing the healthcare costs.  The Group obtained 

Occupational Safety and Health Management System (“OHSAS”) accreditation ISO18001: 2007 

which is subject to annual audit by professional independent consulting firm.  

Compliance with safety rules and procedures is overseen by a registered Competent Safety and 

Health officer who leads the Safety Committee consisting of executive staff.   Regular safety talks 

and trainings are provided to workers from time to time to ensure best safety practices are 

communicated across the entire workplace.  Safety signs and messages are put in the right work 

places. 

As manufacturing plants are exposed to industrial fire risk, The Group regularly conducts fire 

drills involving our effective Emergency Response Team (ERT) to ensure all workers know how 

to exit safely as quickly as possible.  We have the right type and quantity of firefighting equipment, 

fire hose and extinguishers are in place complying with Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department.  

Factory firefighting system is also installed by the government approved contractor, who is also 

engaged to service the firefighting equipment on a monthly basis.  

The Group aims to work towards zero accidents and loss time injuries and the following are the 

health and safety highlights of FY2019 and FY2018:

Labour Relations – Respect Human &amp; Labour Rights and Fair Remuneration 

Globally, The Group employed over 3,900 workers and we are committed to ensuring that the 

rights of all workers are respected according to national and international laws and our 

commitment is evident by the award of Business Social Compliance Initiative (“BSCI”) for being 

compliant with BSCI Code of Conduct.   

The Group adopts code of conduct that spells out our core values in relation to employment, that 

we are committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all with a working 

environment that is free of discrimination and harassment and we do not discriminate on the 

basis of creed and colour, religion, gender, origin, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, 

ancestry or sexual orientation. Child labour is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing and 

no workers under the age of 16 shall be employed. Workers under the age of 18 shall not perform 

hazardous work.  Employees’ privacy is protected and there will be no unauthorised access to 

employee records. 

We have a good and attractive remuneration system in place to reward and retain our employees. 

Wages are paid at the competitive rates and compliant with the Malaysia minimum wage law.  

Salary increment and bonus are granted annually in line with The Group’s financial performance 

and monetary incentives are given periodically to encourage productivity increase. 

The Group is well equipped with facilities for employees’ convenience such as an in-house clinic 

with full time paramedics, 24-hour canteens, hostel accommodation, gymnasium, first aid room, 

laundry, grocery shop and indoor sports arena.

Gymnasium	and	in-house	clinic 

 

 

Grocery	Shop	and	Indoor	Sports	Arena 

Hostel management service is outsourced to a facilities management specialist to ensure the 

hostel facilities are well maintained at all times so that good living conditions and well-being of 

the workers are taken care of.        

Our labour policy, which is published on The Group’s website is in place reflecting The Group’s 

pledge to uphold the human rights of workers. 

Labour Relations – Training &amp; Education 

We ensure that our employees have the skills they need to do their jobs and as they build their 

career with us.  We value our employees as the human capital asset and as the backbone of our 

operations and hence, we continue to develop our human capital by having them sent for 

professional training to equip them with skills relevant to their job requirement.   Our training 

policy requires that all heads of department review and prepare Training Needs Identification 

(TNI) for their staff at the start of each year. 

Orientation briefings for new joiners and other in-house trainings are conducted on a need basis 

by our senior executives.  On average, employees of The Group requiring external training 

received 13 hours of training in FY2019 (FY2018: 35), lower by 63% due mainly to a lengthy Fire 

Safety course conducted in FY2018 involving plant wide departmental Safety personnel, who 

would then provide on-site training to new staff from time to time.   

 
























 

 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 | RIVERSTONE HOLDINGS LIMITED | Page 14  

 

Governance	Material	Factors	

Anti-Bribery &amp; Anti-Corruption 

 

The Group seeks to foster an environment where honesty, integrity and ethical practices are 

maintained. We do not authorise and condone, directly or indirectly through others any unlawful 

or unethical behaviour, which serves the interests of all stakeholders.  

We have zero tolerance for any form of financial misconduct including bribery and corruption 

and we have put in place a Code of Conduct including anti-corruption policy which entails the 

prohibition of accepting and offering of bribes, kickbacks, customary facilitation payments and 

gifts.  Employees must also avoid situations giving rise to personal interests that are in conflict 

with The Group’s interests. Declaration forms to pledge for anti-bribery and anti-corruption 

practices are signed by all employees and vendors aiming to assure all dealings are conducted in 

an even-handed manner.  

There were no incidents of bribery and corruption reported during the sustainability reporting 

period of FY2018 and FY2019. 

Whistle Blowing Policy  

Whistle blowing policy and arrangement is also implemented requiring stakeholders to raise 

legitimate concern in relation to criminal activities, breach of legal obligation, miscarriage of 

justice, activities posing risk of danger to health and safety.  The communication channel guide is 

included in the policy for whistle blowers whose identity will be protected if they elect to remain 

anonymous.  Genuine and legitimate complaint will be investigated, progress updates and 

outcome of the investigation will be made known to the complainant.  Both Code of Conduct and 

whistle blowing policies are available for download on The Group’s website.
