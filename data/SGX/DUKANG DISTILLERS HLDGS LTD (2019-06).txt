Named after the forefather of baijiu (白酒) and drawing upon a long history and rich cultural heritage of over 

five thousand years, the「Dukang」brand is poised to target the mid-to-high end baijiu market in the PRC.

The Group’s products are sold via distributors mainly to supermarkets, flagship stores, specialty stores and 

restaurants.

The Group currently has an annual grain alcohol production capacity of 4,684 tonnes from 2,428 

fermentation pools for the「Dukang」brand. 

With its distinctive taste and brewed using traditional methods, the「Dukang」brand has clinched national 

awards including China Intangible Cultural Heritage (2008), Henan Well-known Trademark (2008), China 

Well-known Trademark (2005), China Time-honoured Brand (2005), Top 10 Chinese Wine Brands (2001) and 

Star Enterprise of The National Wine Industry (1994).

MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

Dear Stakeholders, 

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to announce the publication of our Sustainability Report 2019 that is 

in compliance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, in relation to the financial year ended 

30 June 2019 (“FY2019”). 

With stakeholders’ growing expectations in engaging global issues, the Board believes that being 

sustainable and dynamic in the ever-changing world of business is the way to sustain growth. We believe 

that this demonstrates our commitment to our stakeholders. 

The Group takes pride in its assurance of the range of quality baijiu products, to cater to the needs of a 

wide spectrum of consumer profile. We have, in our employment, technical experts who have between 20 

to 30 years of experience in the baijiu industry including our brewmasters. Our brewmasters are proficient in 

baijiu tasting and brewing and have been accredited for their proficiency at national or provincial levels.

We believe that having an established quality management system is instrumental to our success and to 

maintain our brand recognition as a producer of quality baijiu products. We have established a stringent 

quality management system to ensure adherence to and consistency in quality, cleanliness and hygiene 

standards for our raw ingredients, taste, packaging and other product quality attributes. 

We place strong importance in the relationship between customers and stakeholders and have steadily 

continue to improve in strengthening our current position in the market. Our sales staff visit our customers

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Responsible drinking

Moderate consumption of alcohol can be part of a balanced lifestyle. As a premium baijiu brand in the PRC, 

Dukang Distillers has both the opportunity and the responsibility to make moderate drinking aspirational. 

As an industry leader we implement a consistent, effective approach to encouraging responsible attitudes 

to alcohol and actively discourage abuse of alcohol. By doing so, we play an active role to support the 

reduction of irresponsible drinking.

laws, as well as other relevant regulations (for example, TV and cinema advertising, sponsorship and internet 

regulations). 

Labels of all our products will include wordings that states that excessive drinking is harmful to health  

(过量饮酒  有害健康) to inform consumers about responsible drinking. This is in accordance to Food label 

management regulations (食品标识管理规定) and General Rules for Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods (预包装

食品标签通则).

The Group places utmost importance on ensuring food safety for all our products, and we are committed to

Safety Office and the Quality Control Department are responsible for managing the production process 

according to the “Quality and Safety Management Manual”, to ensure hygiene conditions are in compliance 

with relevant laws and regulations.

From the procurement of raw materials like sorghum to the packing and distribution of our products, we 

exercise extreme caution in evaluating the quality of our suppliers’ products to ensure food safety along our 

value chain.

The Group abides by laws and regulations in relation to food safety and production safety, including but not 

limited to the following:

General Rules for Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods (预包装食品标签通则)

• 

Food Label Management Regulations (食品标识管理规定)

In order to ensure the safe production of our baijiu products, the Quality Assurance Department conducts 

weekly supervision and inspection of food safety and organizes monthly food safety emergency drills. The 

Quality Assurance Department also conducts a self-assessment assessment of the food safety protection 

plan every six months to evaluate the suitability of food safety and security strategies. Last but not least, the 

Group will conduct quality system inspection annually to ensure the effective implementation of the quality 

and food safety management systems in place. 

The Group did not identify any non-compliance with local laws and regulations relating to customer health 

and safety during the reporting period.

ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION

Respect for the environment is fundamental to ensure the excellence of the Group’s products. We abide by 

the Environmental Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (中华人民共和国环境保护法) and the 

Environmental Protection Regulations of Henan Province (河南省环境保护条例).

During the period under review, the water and energy consumption of the company were as follows:

Resource

FY2018

FY2019

Water (m3)

188,203*

280,051

Electricity (kWh)

3,907,104

3,170,986

Gas (m3)

0

820,796

* 1 January 2018 till 30 June 2018

Previously, the Group has taken the initiative to convert all coal-fired boilers to fire natural gas to ensure 

energy conservation and emission reduction. For FY2018, no gas was used as there was no grain alcohol 

production in view of the tepid market demand. The Group began to produce grain alcohol again in 

FY2019.

Water plays a vital role in the ecosystem of the Group’s production. Its collection, use and treatment are 

subject to attentive oversight. Starting from 2018, the Group’s distilleries will be paying water conservation 

fee to the local authority for underground water extraction for productions. Previously, the usage of 

groundwater by industrial users at Ruyang County and Yichuan County were unmetered. Going forward, the 

Group will be working towards optimizing its water usage and reducing its ecological footprint.
