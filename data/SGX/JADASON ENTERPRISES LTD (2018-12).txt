MESSAGE FROM THE 

GROUP CEO

Dear Stakeholders,  

We are pleased to release Jadason 

Enterprises’ second annual 

Sustainability Report, subscribing to 

the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards, in accordance with the 

Core option. 

In FY2018, several major events 

which impacted the global economy, 

including the trade war between 

China and its main trading partner, 

the United States putting a 

downward pressure to the Group, 

which operates mainly in China, 

reported a loss after taxation for the 

year ended in 31 December 2018.  

The Group and many other factories in China have faced increasing labour cost and difficulties in retaining 

the workers. Turnover of workers at the Group’s plant in China was high in FY2018, which negatively affected 

the growth and expansion at these plants.  

With the challenging operating conditions, the Group continues to position its “Manufacturing and Support 

Services” operations and “Equipment and Supplies” business for long term growth.  

In this report, we will continue to focus on the two plants in Dongguan, China as they generated the highest 

revenue in the Group and have the widest material impact on sustainability issues. We undertook an in-depth 

materiality assessment in FY2017 for our business operation in Dongguan, China and identified the 

materiality issues that were deemed important.  

We aim to conduct reviews on our materiality issues every three years, as we recognise that the materiality 

issues of our business may evolve over time.

The materiality issues that were identified from the material topic in FY2017 on Corporate Governance, 

Environmental, Economic, and Social can be found on page 14 in this report.  

Our plants in Dongguan, China focus on “Manufacturing and Support Services” segment, rely heavily on 

energy, water and material usage in their day-to-day operation. The rising challenge of increasing labour cost 

and retaining of manpower, leading the Group to be progressively investing in automation equipments and 

processes to reduce manpower needs and enhance operational efficiency. We are well aware that the 

investment in automation equipments and processes will add-on to the energy and water usage creating an 

impact on the environment.  

Doing our part in sustainability, we had integrated our sustainability practices into our business process in 

both plants. We are actively monitoring and improving on our sustainability practices to reduce the overall 

environmental impact that we had created.  

We are committed to providing high quality and maintaining stringent controls striving for continuous 

operational excellence without compromising on the environment.

JADASON ENTERPRISES LTD

In Jadason Enterprises, our people are the most valuable assets 

that we have in the Group. Our people contributed endlessly to 

provide a high and reliable quality as well as good services to our 

customers across our network in Asia. Jadason Enterprises will not 

be where we are today without the selfless contribution and effort of 

each and every employees that we employed throughout the years.  

In FY2017, the total employees hire and turnover rate and diversification profile only reflected on 

the two plants in Dongguan, China. From FY2018 onwards, Jadason Enterprises will consolidate 

and report the Group’s total employees hire and turnover rate and diversification profile.  

The Group and many other factories in China have faced increasing labour cost and difficulties in 

retaining the workforce. The turnover of workers at the Group’s plant in China was at its high in 

FY2018, which negatively affected the growth and expansion at these plants.

OUR 

PEOPLE

4.1 Employment Profile 

In 2018, our total employment headcount 

across Asia had drop about 8.85% to 700 

employees in 2018. The total permanent 

contract employees had decreased in 

percentage as the total employment decreased 

and the increased in the number of supervised 

worker in FY2018. 

We are mindful of our fair and inclusive 

commitment to have a diversified workforce in 

the Group to support our business growth.  

China had accounted for the highest 

headcount of the Group in FY2018, follow by 

Thailand and Singapore.

4.2 Diversification 

The Group values each and every employee, despite on their age, gender, religion and position.  

The Group provides equal opportunities to all of our employees and do not discriminate them regardless on 

their age or gender. During our employee recruitment, we hire on the basis of value and competency on the 

job instead of their age or gender.  

We believe that a diversified group of employees working and learning together can bring growth to the 

organisation. The younger employees tend to be energetic and ingenuity, while the older employees tend to 

be mature and reliable, bring a wealth of experience with them.  

Our business in China, especially the plants in Dongguan, China is traditionally male-dominated due to the 

nature of the work being more physical demanding. This does not stop us from hiring female employees 

whom are competent for the job. The Group 

operates mainly in China accounted for 86.73% of 

the total headcount in the Group with 74.7% male 

employees. This had put a great weightage to the 

total male employee to female employee in the 

Group to 70.8% and 29.2% respectively.  

From this year onwards, employee diversification 

will be reported as a Group instead of focusing 

mainly on the plants in Dongguan, China. This 

results in a limitation of reporting history for this 

segment. 

Similar to FY2017, the Group has three male and two female directors in the Board for FY2018.

4.3 Hire and Turnover 

In FY2018, the hire and turnover rate for Jadason Enterprises was at its high due to the challenge of 

increasing labour cost and the difficulties in retaining the workers. The plants in China had accounted for 

around 97% of the total hire and turnover rate in the Group for FY2018.  

The vast employment opportunities in China put employing and retaining employees a challenge to the many 

factories and plants in China, including Jadason Enterprises Ltd. The Group will continuously review its 

processes to reduce its manpower requirement and its incentives schemes to retain workers at its facilities.   

During our recruitment or dismissal of employees, we do not discriminate individuals base on their race, age, 

gender, religion and nationality. From FY2018 onwards, the hire and turnover rate will be reported as a Group 

instead of focusing on the plants in Dongguan, China alone. There will not be any historical data for this 

segment.

5.2 Stakeholders’ Engagement 

We engaged with our stakeholders regularly to assess on their interest and potential impact on our 

business. The regular engagement will help to improve our decision-making process and how we assess 

materiality issues.  

We identified our key stakeholders and how we engaged with them as shown on he table below.

5.1 Boundary Setting 

In Jadason Enterprises’ first 

standalone Sustainability Report back 

in FY2017, the management had come to a decision to set the Group’s reporting boundary to the two 

plants in Dongguan, China.

The decision for setting the two plants in Dongguan, China as the reporting boundary was based on the 

fact that they accounted for the highest revenue in the Group and has the widest material impact on the 

sustainability issues. 

In this second standalone Sustainability Report, there will not be any changes to the reporting boundary 

having it being set to the two plants in Dongguan, China. The Group will review on the reporting boundary 

when the reporting matures over time.

5.3 Materiality Assessment 

Materiality issues identified from the assessment marked as a guide for Jadason Enterprises to focus on 

sustainability in a long run. In FY2017, we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis identifying and 

prioritising on the materiality issues that were deemed as important to our business practice and our 

stakeholders. The materiality issues 

identified in FY2017 remain 

important to our business practice 

and our stakeholder for FY2018. 

The materiality issues that were 

identified as important to us are 

namely Corporate Governance, 

Economic, Environmental and 

Social, for Dongguan, China as 

shown on the table beside.   

We aim to conduct reviews of our 

materiality issues every three year, 

as we recognise that the materiality

5.3.1 Economic Performance 

The economic performance and financial 

contribution of Jadason Enterprises had been 

tabulated and published in Jadason Enterprises 

Annual Report 2018.  

The Group Financial Highlight and Operating 

Review can be found on page 4 to 10 of 

Jadason Enterprises Annual Report 2018, while 

the Financial Statement can be found on page 

38 to 97 of Jadason Enterprises Annual Report 

2018.

5.3.2 Anti-corruption 

Jadason Enterprises does not tolerate 

corruption in any part of its business. The Group 

is committed to act professionally, fairly and with 

integrity in all our business dealings and 

relationship.  

Jadason Enterprises had a standard procedure 

to manage and monitor its internal resource 

flow. The Group had strengthen its supervision 

in each department to identify the possibilities of 

corruption. 

5.3.3 Child Labour 

In Jadason Enterprises, we comply with the 

labour laws on wages, working hours, child 

labour and minimum employment age of the 

countries that we operate in. 




To meet the outsourcing needs of 

PCB manufacturers operating in 

China, we provide a “one-stop” 

service in Dongguan, China, 

specialising in PCB, FPC drilling, 

laser drilling, PCB contour routing 

machining, drill pointing and PCB 

inner layer mass lamination. 

These two plants in Dongguan, China focus on the business segment of “Manufacturing and 

Support Services” and rely a lot on energy, water and materials for their daily operation and 

accounted for majority of the consumption in the Group. We are well aware that our business 

operation in a long run will cause a great impact to the 

environment. This will in turn affect the sustainability of 

our business as a Group. 

In FY2018, we have almost 500 employees working with 

us in the two plants in Dongguan, China showing a drop of 

9.36% of employee strength from FY2017. The increasing 

labour cost and difficulties in retaining the workers, 

resulting in a high turnover rate in our plants had 

negatively affected the growth and expansion of these 

plants.  

The Group continuously review its process to reduce 

manpower requirement, and its incentive schemes to 

retain workers at its plant. The Group has also progressively invested in automation equipments 

and processes to reduce its manpower needs and enhanced operational effectiveness in its plant.

6.1 Environmental 

Jadason Enterprises manage the impact of our business operation and activities to the environment by 

integrating our sustainability practices into our business process.  

With the progressive investment in automated equipments 

and processes, adding stress to the environment due to 

the increase in energy and water requirement, the Group 

constantly review on its energy reduction plan in the plants 

to lighten the stress on energy usage in the plants.    

One of the plants in Dongguan, China is governed by ISO 

14001 guidelines on the environmental management 

systems. We are committed to minimise the environmental 

impact of the business operation for the other plant in Dongguan, China with our best effort.  

In FY2018, the two plants in Dongguan, China have one new suppliers that underwent screening based on 

the environmental criteria. 

“Jadason Enterprises aims to 

continuously drive operational 

excellence without 

compromising on the 

environment.”

6.1.1 Materials &amp; Waste 

Our business operation in the two plants in 

Dongguan, China, requires high volume of 

materials which are mainly procured across 

China.  

The materials used in the two plants in 

Dongguan, China are categorised according to 

“raw material”, “associated process material” 

and “materials for packaging”. We measure 

directly on the materials we used to collect the 

volume of our usage of materials identified. 

We recognised that the usage on materials in 

our business operation in Dongguan, China will 

inevitably create an impact to the environment. 

We fully utilise our materials before disposing 

them in the factories in Dongguan, China. 

The tabulated figures of the material usage in 

FY2018 will be higher than FY2017 due to the 

undervalue information collected for “associated 

process material” and “materials for packaging” 

despite the decrease in total production yield. 

We will assure that all future measurements for 

material usage will be uniformed.

“We aim to minimise the impact on 

the environment without producing 

sub quality product. “

Waste material generated by the two plants in Dongguan, China, are disposed according to China

For FY2018, non-renewable waste collected by 

third party waste treatment contractor was 

increased to 88.3% from 80.2% in FY2017. This 

was due to the increase in reporting of non-

renewable material used in the plant resulting in 

the decrease in percentage of renewable waste 

generated and collected.  

The difference in the figure for FY2018 is due to 

the undervalue information collected in FY2017.  

We will assure that the future figures collected 

will be uniform to provide an accurate 

comparison and monitoring of our material 

usage and waste disposal.

The waste materials generated in the plants 

from the daily operations are stored and 

categorised in an easily understandable manner 

in the plants. The waste materials are then 

scheduled and collected by our third party 

waste treatment contractor accordingly. 

For renewable materials that were identified, we 

stored the waste materials that were generated 

from the daily operations in a separate area 

from non-renewable waste. These renewable 

waste will be sold to a third party collector in 

Dongguan, China for recycling process.

6.1.2 Energy Consumption 

Our business operation in the two plants in Dongguan, China generally work around machineries and 

equipments on daily basis consuming high amount of electric energy. We are well aware that the high 

amount of energy consumption in the plants will create an impact to our environment. In a long run, it will 

affect the sustainability of our business. 

We purchase our electric energy directly from municipal electric supplier situated in Dongguan, China. 

Periodical checking and recording on the electric usage from electric meters in the two plants were arranged 

by the electric supplier. 

A drop of energy consumption was observed in 

FY2018, compared to the record in FY2017 for 

the two plants in Dongguan, China. The 

measurement record had been changed to “tce” 

from “kwh” in FY2017 due to the standardisation 

on the reporting units for the reports for both 

China and Singapore.  

The likelihood on the effectiveness of electrical 

reduction plan in FY2018 may be 

undeterminable due to several factors. A 

decreased in the total manpower and total 

production yield in FY2018, may directly or 

indirectly drives the reduction of total energy 

consumption.   

The plants in Dongguan, China subscribe to 

GB/T13234-2009 on the methodologies and 

assumptions used for the calculation of energy 

consumption.



FY2017

35kwh/m2

FY2018

1034.21 tce 

From FY2018 onwards, we will standardise the calculation unit for energy consumption at “tce”. The 

calculation method for “tce” is shown as follow: 

(12 months x 30 days x KWh) / 10000 x 1.229 = tce 

We will strictly adhere to the standards on our electric energy consumption and reduction in the plants to 

achieve our energy reduction goal in FY2020. We continuously review our energy saving plan through 

monitoring, analysing and optimising the energy consumption in the plants.  

We are committed to the continual reduction of energy consumption plan in the plants without penalising our 

customer’s expectations.

JADASON ENTERPRISES LTD

We subscribed to Dongguan Province, China on the Five-Year Plan on energy saving for the two plants 

in Dongguan, China. To achieve our energy reduction target, we draw up an energy reduction plan for the 

two plants in Dongguan, China. 

ENERGY REDUCTION PLAN

TRANSFORMATION

ADJUST AND OPTIMISE ENERGY STRUCTURE

PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL AND BUILDING ENERGY 

RETROFIT

PROMOTE INNOVATIVE ENERGY CONSERVATION IN 

TRANSPORTATION

PROMOTE EQUIPMENT RETROFIT

LAUCH ONLINE ENERGY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT

CULTIVATE ENERGY CONSERVATION AND 

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

The Five-Year Plan calls for a total 

energy reduction of 19.3% energy 

consumption per unit of GDP by 

FY2020.  

Some arrangements that we made 

for the reduction plan are (1) to 

turn on the air conditional half an 

hour after the workers start work, 

maintain the temperature at 25 

degree Celcius and turn off the air 

conditional half an hour before 

ending work, (2) upgrade 

equipments and machines to 

minimise the usage of electricity, 

(3) changes the light tubes to LED, 

etc.

6.1.3 Water Withdrawal 

We recorded substantially high amount of water 

withdrawal for our business operation in 

Dongguan, China. The water are mainly used in 

our operation process, periodical machinery 

upkeep and maintenance.  

The two plants in Dongguan, China rely their 

water supply from two sources. The main water 

supply source is purchasing from municipal 

water supplier situated in Dongguan, while the 

other water supply source is from our own water 

recycle plant situated in one of our plants. 

We subscribe to the PCB industrial water 

standard, methodology and assumption to 

operate our water recycle plant. This standard is 

relevant to our business operation of the plant 

where the water recycle plant is situated.  

For FY2018, an estimation of 217,440 tonnes of 

water was withdrawn from our municipal water 

supplier, while 72,400 tonnes of water was 

withdrawn from our water recycling plant. 

The figures represented for FY2018 is lower 

than FY2017, due to the decrease in production 

yield in FY2018 resulting in the decrease in 

recycled water usage.  

Tabulating to 75.02% and 24.98% of purchased 

water and recycled water.

6.2 Our People in Dongguan, China 

Our two plants in Dongguan, China employed almost 500 employees in FY2018 which is 9.36% decrease 

from FY2017. 

The vast work opportunities in China results in a rapid turnover of manpower in the two plants. Retaining 

manpower in China became one of our priority issues to maintaining a sustainable business.  

Our employees play an important role to the 

continual growth of Jadason Enterprises. We 

continuously review our incentives schemes to 

retain manpower in the plants. 

We work towards providing a happy and 

engaging workforce throughout their 

employment with Jadason Enterprises. We 

believe that a happy and engaged workforce 

will ultimately translate to happy and satisfied 

customers and this may in turn promote the 

growth of our business in this segment as well 

as Jadason Enterprises as a whole.

6.2.2 Employee Wellness 

In Jadason Enterprises, we believe that the 

well-being of our employees will lead to a 

productive workforce.  

China has been rapidly growing over the years, 

with more business setting up in the country 

creating more work opportunities for the people 

in China. This results in the growing importance 

on employee welfare, incentives and well-being 

in the plants to better retaining the employees 

The two plants in Dongguan, China, provides 

benefits such as insurance (maternity, industrial 

injury, medical and pension/retirement), housing 

provident fund, and leaves (annual, marriage, 

maternity) to our full-time employees. An additional 

retirement plan is being drawn up for male 

employees above 60 years old, and female 

employees above 50 years old working in the 

plants. 

Our part-time or temporary employees do not 

enjoy most of the benefits compared to our full-

time employees.































We provide a well-facilitated dormitory that is 

situated near the plants for our employees. Our 

employees are able to utilise places like the 

Reading Room, Entertainment Room, TV 

Room, etc during their spare time. 

To cultivate and encourage team work and 

communication, activities such as basketball 

match, tug-of-war or table tennis, etc were 

organised for the employees.  

We recognise the importance for having our 

employees to feel a sense of belonging in the 

company throughout their employment in 

Jadason Enterprises.
