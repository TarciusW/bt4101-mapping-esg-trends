BOARD STATEMENT 

GRI 102-14 

Heeton prides itself on its international portfolio of distinctive, high-quality properties in the 

residential, commercial and hospitality sectors, and its success in delivering stakeholder value by 

converting opportunity into growth. 

With 14 hotels in our property portfolio as at December 2020, we are on track to become a strategic 

player on the international hospitality stage. We are, however, very aware of the environmental and 

societal responsibility that this growth brings. Heeton recognises that its development strategy must 

consider the wider expectations of all its stakeholders, including customers, employees and investors. 

We will continue to create value for our shareholders while benefitting all stakeholders through 

actions to reduce negative societal and environmental impact. 

We regularly review key aspects of our real estate and hospitality operations – including workplace 

health and safety, and our consumption of natural resources – to ensure our conformity to global 

standards and local regulatory requirements. As well as benefitting society and the environment, such 

reviews also improve our economic efficiency. Our evolution towards more sustainable practices also 

attracts a new generation of talent, and customers who are more environmentally conscious. 

In addition to strong internal governance policies that ensure high ethical standards in compliance, 

transparency and business conduct, Heeton adheres to management approaches and targets for 

talent retention, health and safety, supplier assessment, and energy and water efficiency. 

Heeton’s Board oversees the Group’s sustainability strategy and the development of policies and 

management structures to monitor and report our social and environmental performance.  

This Sustainability Report highlights our achievements and targets in key material areas and efforts to 

positively impact our stakeholders. It is based on 10 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 

factors that represent key risks and opportunities for our business and address the concerns of our 

stakeholders.  

While we continue expanding our hospitality business, we will strive to improve sustainability 

reporting in our global operations and throughout our value chain. 

Thank you for your interest in Heeton’s 2020 Sustainability Report. We welcome feedback from all our 

stakeholders and look forward to continuing our journey towards a more sustainable future.

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2020 

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS  

 

FY2020 was not a typical operating year. The Covid-19 pandemic created a global economic downturn 

that forced many businesses into survival mode. Movement restrictions and nation-wide lockdowns 

added to pressure and Heeton, like many companies, were forced to close their business premises for 

large stretches of time, invariably affecting overall performance and profitability. Figures reported for 

the year 2020 should be reviewed in this light.

Heeton Holdings Limited is a real estate company focused on property development, investment and 

management. Established in 1976, the Company was listed on the Singapore Exchange in September 

2003, and has since extended its business frontiers beyond Singapore to Thailand, Australia, Japan, 

Malaysia, Vietnam and the United Kingdom. As a boutique property developer, Heeton enjoys a 

reputation for distinctive and high quality developments in the choicest districts of some of the world’s 

major cities including Singapore, London and Bangkok. Heeton Has also formed strong partnerships 

with other established real estate groups to develop properties locally and internationally.  

Heeton’s growth in the property industry is underpinned by a stable real estate portfolio that includes 

commercial properties (shopping malls and serviced offices) and hotels. Heeton entered the 

hospitality sector in 2011 with the acquisition of the Mercure Hotel Pattaya, Thailand. Following an 

aggressive expansion programme the Group’s hotel portfolio has now increased to 14 properties 

worldwide, as at December 2020.

OUR GOVERNANCE  

GRI 102-16, 102-18 

Heeton considers high ethical standards in compliance, transparency, and business conduct to be the 

key to lasting stakeholder trust and confidence. To ensure that we run our operations and grow our 

business with integrity, we have implemented robust governance-related policies and procedures. 

Our Board oversees the corporate governance structure and sustainability strategy of the Group. It is 

also responsible for the overall management and reporting of sustainability performance and receives 

regular reports on sustainability-related issues from the relevant heads of business units. These 

managers also participate in the development of Heeton’s sustainability policies and are in charge of 

integrating appropriate practices and procedures into our operations. 

Our employees are expected to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity at work. Heeton’s code 

of conduct is included in the Group’s Employee Handbook, together with regulations and guidelines 

on issues such as discipline, confidentiality, and intellectual property. 

PREVENTING CORRUPTION 

GRI 205-2, 205-3 

Heeton is committed to upholding a high level of business ethics and integrity, including amongst our 

suppliers and business partners. We believe that the prevention of corruption in our value chain is 

vital to safeguard the interests of our stakeholders and Heeton’s reputation. All forms of corruption 

are forbidden: this encompasses dishonest business practices such as conflict of interest, acceptance 

of gifts, or improper use of insider information.  

Employees are required to adhere to our corporate policies on anti-corruption, anti-money 

laundering, whistle-blowing, and blackout periods. All new hires are required to go through a 

mandatory induction programme where they are made aware of these policies, and our code of 

conduct and procedures.  

We are pleased to report that there were no incidents of corruption at our headquarters or managed 

hotels during FY2020. 

Our whistleblowing policy aims to encourage responsible and secure reporting of any incident of 

violation or suspected violation of our code of conduct, such as unethical or illegal practices. Should 

such an incident occur, it should be reported to a member of Heeton’s management.  

In case of any dissatisfaction with the handling of such a report, the matter can be escalated to the 

Executive Deputy Chairman or the Audit Committee Chairman.

 Heeton Holdings Limited Sustainability Report FY2020 

ENSURING COMPLIANCE  

GRI 307-1, 419-1 

Compliance with environmental and social laws is the baseline to meet stakeholders’ expectations and 

maintain the license to operate.  

Our operations and properties in Singapore are subject to multiple laws and regulations, such as the 

Workplace Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection and Management Act and the Energy 

Conservation Act, covering air pollution, noise, wastewater discharge and other environmental 

impacts. For our overseas portfolio, including our property developments, we abide by all applicable 

environmental and social legislations.  

We actively identify and manage our regulatory risks and we keep abreast of developments in 

sustainability-related law and related legislative updates. We also ensure that our suppliers and 

partners abide by all relevant regulations. 

In FY2020, our operations bore no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the 

environmental social and economic areas resulting in significant fines or sanctions. Looking forward, 

we will continue our efforts to ensure full environmental and social compliance in all our operations 

and to further reduce our environmental impacts.  

MANAGING ESG ISSUES IN OUR VALUE CHAIN 

Heeton promotes sustainability across its value chain. The nature of our real estate business often 

requires the appointment of a third-party service provider, or collaboration with a joint venture 

partner. We recognise the importance of maintaining transparency and working responsibly with 

these external parties and others in our value chain.  

We prioritise suppliers and contractors who engage in sustainable practices to ensure safe working 

conditions and respect worker rights. All Heeton’s suppliers are encouraged to adhere to best 

practices and industry standards, such as obtaining Building and Construction Authority (BCA) 

certifications.  

We also conduct regular checks on our suppliers and business partners for anti-money laundering or 

other unethical practices. This includes keeping a close watch on news coverage related to our joint 

venture partners, and ensuring that any ESG issues are addressed promptly.  

Our supply chain 

GRI 102-9 

In Singapore, the majority of our suppliers are locally based and comprise utilities providers and 

agencies for office supply, information technology, travel and maintenance tasks at our 

headquarters. Our two managed investment properties in Singapore rely on external providers for 

cleaning, security, pest control and other maintenance services. Our eight managed hotels in the 

UK rely on hundreds of small-to-large suppliers, including food, beverage and professional service 

providers.  

We ensure that suppliers’ personnel are covered by our internal policies and requirements, such as 

safety and security, when they are working at our premises.

GROWING WITH OUR PEOPLE  

In our rapidly changing business landscape, the attraction, recruitment and retention of skilled 

employees with relevant and current expertise is important. We recognise the value that our 

employees bring to the Group and are proud of their contribution to our on-going success and 

sustainability. 

DIVERSIFYING OUR WORKFORCE 

GRI 102-7, 102-8, 405-1 

Heeton’s human resource policies are grounded in equal opportunities and fair employment practices. 

In our recruitment process, all qualified candidates are considered without discrimination of gender, 

age, ethnicity, religion and national origin. Our employees are promoted based on merit and 

performance. We also value the expertise of older employees and continue to employ individuals over 

the national retirement age. 

As at 31 December 2020, our headquarters had 48 employees and our eight hotels in the UK employed  

103 people, making a total workforce of 151 for the Group. Of these, six (4% of total workforce) held 

a senior management position, 80 (53%) held manager or executive roles, and 65 (43%) were non-

executives. The proportion of non-executive staff was significantly higher at the UK hotels compared 

to at our headquarters, being 60 (58.3% of their workforce), and 5 (10.4%) respectively.  

In terms of employment types, the ratio of full-time over part-time employees was 42:6(87.5%:12.5%) 

for the headquarters and 71:32 (69.0%:31.0%) for the UK hotels. The proportion of temporary 

employees was relatively similar at headquarters as in the UK hotels, with respectively eight 

employees (16.7%) and 18 employees (17.5%) under a temporary contract. 

Women made up 64.6% (31 women compared to 17 males) and 49.5% (51 women compared to 52 

males) of our headquarters and UK hotels’ workforce respectively. As shown in the charts below, the 

proportion of women at Group level was essentially higher in manager and executive positions, while 

employees aged 30 years and above held most of the senior management, manager and executive 

roles.

VALUING AND RETAINING OUR EMPLOYEES 

GRI 401-1, 403-3 

In recognition of their contribution to the success of Heeton’s business, and to retain our skilled 

workforce, we reward employees with competitive salaries in line with market standards. 

Compensation to individual employees is determined by their position, competency and performance. 

Furthermore, employees are entitled to a variety of benefits, such as medical care, paid annual leave 

and birthday leave. They can also opt for a flexible work arrangement.  

Our Employee Handbook provides general guidelines about our policies, procedures and practices, 

terms and conditions, as well as the compensation and benefits package available to them. 

In FY2020, the Group hire rate4 was 52.3%, with a total of 79 new employees hired during the year. At 

the headquarters, the hire rate was 12.5% (six new employees), while the hire rate was 70.9% (73 new 

employees) at the UK hotels. The hire rates for female employees were 16.1% (five new employees) 

for the headquarters and 64.7% (33 new employees) for the UK hotels. Comparatively, the hire rates 

for male employees were 5.9% (one new employee) for the headquarters and 76.9% (40 new 

employees) for the UK hotels. 

The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the economies of the world for most of 2020 and 

the travel and tourism industry was and remains one of the worst-hit sectors. All the Group’s hotels 

worldwide were badly affected by travel and movement restrictions both foreign and domestic were 

imposed by the government sporadically throughout the year, leaving hotels to fight for their share of 

a market limited to domestic key workers, front-liners and those with exceptional reasons for travel. 

 

During this time, the management of the eight hotels in the UK undertook a redundancy exercise and 

restructured the workforce to remain competitive during this turbulent times. The high employee 

turnover rate in the UK hotels is by no means a permanent matter and the management will look into 

strengthening its workforce once the pandemic is under controlled and borders are reopened to 

international travel 

 

In FY2020, our headquarters had a turnover rate of 31.3% with 15 employees leaving the company, 

while the turnover rate at our UK hotels was 96.1% with 99 leavers, making a global rate of 75.5% for 

the entire Group. In terms of gender, female employees had the highest turnover with a global rate 

of 76.8% (63 leavers), close to the 73.9% (51 leavers) for the male employees.

ENHANCING THE SKILLS OF OUR EMPLOYEES 

GRI 404-1, 404-3 

In a dynamic business environment, Heeton recognises the need to arm its employees with the new 

skills necessary to sustain our growth.  

Our active approach to learning supports the personal and professional development of our 

employees through training programmes designed to empower them to reach their full potential and 

keep them abreast of new technologies and opportunities in the real estate sector. Training is carried 

out on topics including management and leadership, information technology (e.g. cybersecurity) and 

safety (e.g. first aid). 

We also encourage employees to attend external courses for their professional development. Our 

employees can apply for financial sponsorship for eligible courses and be granted up to seven days of 

study leave per year. 

Our Human Resources Department tracks and monitors the training records of employees. One-on-

one reviews are conducted post-training to highlight any gaps in the programme or identify new 

training needs. Globally, each of Heeton’s employees completed an average of 5.05 training hours 

during FY2020. This represents a significant decrease compared to FY2019’s global average of 15.25 

hours per employee. Much of this decrease can be attributed to the challenges brought about by the 

Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in many redundancies and put many non-essential programmes 

on hold as survival of the business became the priority.   

Non-executive personnel at our headquarters benefitted from the highest number of training hours, 

with an average of 15 hours in FY2020, while UK hotels non-executive employees received an average 

of 4.0 training hours each. For FY2021, we aim to maintain or exceed the current average figures. 

We conduct annual reviews with employees during which we discuss performance and career goals 

to support their professional growth. In FY2020, 70% of our global workforce received feedback on 

their performance and suggestions on improvement from their supervisors.  

We will continue to engage with our employees to fine-tune our training programmes and align them 

to their learning needs.

OUR SAFETY PRACTICES  

GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-7, 403-9, 416-1, 416-2 

As an employer and landlord, Heeton recognises its responsibility to ensure that our employees, 

customers and all other users of our premises can enjoy a safe and healthy environment.  

We regularly assess our safety practices to identify potential hazards within our operations. Risk 

assessment is reviewed and updated to follow preventive and corrective action plans.  

We provide an open channel of communication across all levels of the Group to gather feedback on 

issues relating to health and safety. In addition, we aim to inculcate a culture of ownership for health 

and safety among employees and tenants through regular safety education and training, including fire 

drills and first aid courses.  

As part of their induction, operational teams complete an on-line health and safety training 

programme and must familiarise themselves with their workplace. They are also instructed to report 

any hazards identified. Where required, suppliers and visitors to the premises must sign in and are 

supervised by our trained employees.  

Standard safety procedures and contingency plans have been established at all our properties and 

hotels. This includes internal and external audits, fire safety practices and regular fire safety audits 

and drills led by our property managers. Equipment is inspected and upgraded whenever necessary 

to ensure that it is in sound working condition. The property managers also ensure timely renewal of 

operating permits and licenses for fire safety installations, lifts and escalators and areas of high safety 

risks. 

Moreover, the importance of safety is emphasised during engagements with third-party service 

providers. In our development projects, weekly health and safety meetings are conducted by the main 

contractor along with Heeton’s project manager. We also conduct regular site visits to ensure that our 

main contractor is complying with all health and safety requirements. Corrective actions are enforced 

for any on-site safety concerns.  

In FY2020, no Heeton employees suffered workplace fatalities. Neither were there any incidents of 

non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our 

managed developments.  

Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, Heeton has taken employee safety seriously by ensuring 

all non-essential member of staff work from home during the nationwide Circuit Breaker initiative. 

Following the relaxation of the safe distancing measures, staff members who could work from home 

continued to do so, and those who had to travel to the office were given flexible work arrangements.  

In the workplace, Heeton have ensured all employees work in a safe space by taking all necessary 

measurements including flexible work arrangements, working from home if possible, ensuring 

employees keep to the safe distancing measures in accordance with government regulations and 

temperature taking for any individual entering the building premises.   

Going forward, Heeton will stay committed to promoting occupational and customer health and 

safety, preventing non-compliance, and maintaining zero fatalities among our employees and other 

users of our buildings.

OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT  

GRI 102-11 

Both the real estate and the hospitality sectors are high consumers of resources, such as energy and 

water. Heeton recognises that it should not delay taking appropriate actions to reduce its 

environmental impact.  

In this respect, we have already adopted green practices to improve resource conservation. These 

include energy and water usage reduction measures such as LED lighting, motion-sensor light switches 

water saving practices and water-efficient equipment, implemented at our properties and hotels.  

Monthly reports on energy and water consumption at our investment properties are reviewed by our 

management to detect any irregularities and take appropriate actions. At our hotels, tracking of 

energy and water consumption is done via an online tool to ensure the efficiency of implemented 

resource conservation measures. 

We promote environmental awareness among our employees and tenants through e-mails on best 

practices to help reduce their environmental footprint at work. 

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS 

GRI 302-1, 302-3, 305-1, 305-2, 305-4 

In FY2020, Heeton consumed a total of 93,409 GJ in energy, 39% of which was consumed by our 

activities in Singapore and 61% by our UK properties. 51.7% of the total energy consumed comprised 

natural gas used by our UK hotels, while the remaining 48.3% was purchased electricity. Our two 

managed investment properties in Singapore were our biggest electricity consumers with 36,309 GJ 

(over 10 million kWh). Comparatively, our eight UK hotels consumed 8,594 GJ (about 2.4 million kWh) 

of electricity. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION5 (GLOBAL - FY2020) 

 

Our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions amounted to 7,163 tCO2e (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) in 

FY2020. This included 34.4% or 2,461 tCO2e of Scope 1 emissions6 that generated from natural gas 

consumption by our hotels, while 65.6% or 4,702 tCO2e represented Scope 2 emissions7 generated 

 

5 Energy and emissions figures are compiled using the latest Singapore’s grid emission factors published by Energy Market 

Authority and relevant conversion factors from the UK Government’s DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural 

Affairs). 

6 Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions of GHG produced from sources that are owned or controlled by an organisation. 

7 Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions of GHG produced from the consumption of purchased electricity.

from our overall electricity consumption. Despite a lower amount of energy consumed compared to 

our UK operations, our activities in Singapore remained our largest emitters of GHG. This is due to a 

high proportion of fossil fuels used to produce Singapore’s grid electricity.  

GHG EMISSIONS (GLOBAL - FY2020) 

 

In FY2020, the average electricity intensity of our two investment properties in Singapore was 352.5 

kWh (1.27 GJ) per square meter (m2) of floor area, corresponding to an emission intensity of 0.144 

tCO2e/m2.  

WATER 

GRI 303-1, 303-2, 303-3 

Our investment properties and office headquarters in Singapore withdraw water from public networks 

and all used water is discharged back into the city’s sewerage system, where it is treated and recycled 

according to local regulations. No used water is discharged directly into the environment.  

In FY2020, our headquarters consumed 306 m3 of water, which represented only 0.4% of our Group’s 

total water consumption of 83,600 m3 during the year. Due to their high retail activity, our two 

investment properties in Singapore used the largest amount of water, with 57,702 m3 or 69.0% of the 

total. Comparatively, our six hotels in the UK consumed 25,592 m3, or 30.6% of the total, during the 

year.   

The water intensity of the investment properties was 2.02 m3 per m2 of floor area during the year.
