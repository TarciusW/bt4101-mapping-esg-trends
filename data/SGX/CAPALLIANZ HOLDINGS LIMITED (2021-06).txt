CORPORATE PROFILE 

CapAllianz Holdings Limited 共享资本集团 (“CapAllianz” or the “Company”, and together with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group”) is an investment holding company focusing on the oversight and 

management of a portfolio of investments, held through its subsidiaries and associated companies. 

The Group’s strategy is to leverage the strengths of its team of professionals to identify and invest 

in promising businesses and improve the business operations of the investee companies to 

maximise investment returns for its portfolio of investments. 

 

The Group’s current portfolio of investments comprises (i) the Oil and Gas sector; and (ii) the 

Consumer sector. 

 

Under the Oil and Gas portfolio, the Group holds a 20% stake in the Thailand onshore oil 

concessions located at Phetchabun Basin. These concessions currently generate steady income 

from its existing oil producing wells. With substantial proven reserves for development as well as 

significant potential exploration upside, this investment holds the promise of value enhancement 

and sustainable long-term growth as the joint operators continue to work towards unlocking the 

untapped reserves.  

 

The Group’s Consumer portfolio consists of a 40% stake in Preferred Mart Pte. Ltd. (“Preferred 

Mart”), which holds a 100% stake in a supermarket business in Singapore, as well as a 40% stake 

in a health and wellness business in Singapore. The supermarket business currently operates 

through a retail outlet and e-commerce platforms where it has a growing subscriber base of more 

than 150,000 in Singapore. Preferred Mart intends to grow this business mainly through broadening 

its online sales channels and working with partners to increase distribution channels. The health 

and wellness business is a new business, which is being set up currently. It aims to offer affordable 

hyperbaric oxygen therapy (“HBOT”) using patented Japanese technology. As it uses atmospheric 

pressure of 1.3 atmosphere absolute (ATA), the HBOT is able to deliver optimal and targeted 

benefits without the risks and medical supervision required of higher ATA versions, to help improve 

the overall health and wellness of consumers.  

 

CapAllianz Holdings is listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited under stock code 594.

 BOARD STATEMENT 

The board of directors of CapAllianz Holdings Limited (“CapAllianz” or the “Company”, and together 

with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to present the 2021 Sustainability Report (the “Report”) 

for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 (“FY2021”).  

This Report covers the Group's two core business segments, namely (i) investments and trading 

activities under CWX Investments Pte. Ltd. (“CWX Investments”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 

Company, which holds a 40% stake in Preferred Mart Pte. Ltd. (“Preferred Mart”) operating a 

supermarket business (100% stake) and a health and wellness business (40% stake) in Singapore; 

and (ii) oil and gas business under Loyz Oil Thailand Pte. Ltd. (“Loyz Thailand”), a wholly-owned 

subsidiary of the Company, which is the holder of a 20% stake in three oil-producing onshore 

concessions – SW1, L44/43, and L33/43s located in the Phetchabun Basin, Thailand (the 

“Concessions”). The Group’s primary income flow is from the sale of oil extracted from the 

Concessions.  

 

The Group takes effective corporate governance at all levels to ensure sound business decisions 

are made. Corporate governance also ensures business operations are carried out properly and 

with a proper monitoring feedback system to enhance future strategic formulations. 

 

As responsible corporate citizens, we consider sustainability issues from the perspective of our 

own business growth. We will grow our sustainability approach in the medium and long term to 

bring in more Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors to measure sustainability and 

ethical impact of our key investments under CWX Investments and Loyz Thailand. 

 

This Report is set out on a comply or explain basis in accordance with Rule 711B and Practice Note 

7F on “Sustainability Reporting Guide” of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-

ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”). It is based on the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards (2016) (Core option) which provides a framework for the reporting of 

economic, environmental and social impact. In this Report, we have also described our 

commitments, governance, policies, performance and targets in relation to managing the 

sustainability risks and opportunities during FY2021.

 OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 

Report Scope 

 

While the Group has a number of subsidiaries, this Report will focus on the Group’s key investments 

under CWX Investments and Loyz Thailand (collectively, the “Companies”), which are the two key 

subsidiaries of the Company undertaking the Group’s two core business segments, as described 

above.   

 

Materiality Assessment 

 

This Report uses a targeted approach to identify ESG factors which are of high importance to our 

stakeholders and essential for the Companies. Our materiality approach is closely guided by our 

core values of creating stakeholders’ value and long-term sustainability of the Group’s businesses. 

The criteria were determined through an internal survey of managerial staff and compiled into this 

Report. 

 

The Companies adhere to the GRI Standards’ principle on materiality and have adopted a three-

step approach to identify, prioritise and validate various ESG factors significant to both the 

businesses and stakeholders of the Group.

Material Factors 

As part of this Report, the Group has conducted an internal survey and has determined the following 

key material factors. Please refer to Diagram 1: Material Factors below for more information. 

 

Diagram 1: Material Factors 

 

Management Approach 

 

Here at CapAllianz, we value integrity, professionalism, enterprise and mutual respect. We expect 

all our staff to adhere to these principles and strictly adhere to laws and regulations wherever we 

operate in the world. Please refer to Diagram 2: CapAllianz Business Method for more information. 

 

While the Company is, first and foremost, an investment company, we are acutely aware of the 

environmental impact of the industries we invest in and through our shareholdings and 

participation in meetings, we share our values of professionalism and adherence to all laws and 




 

9 | Page 

 

regulations, especially environmental regulations, in relation to our oil and gas business segment, 

to relevant stakeholders. 

 

 

Diagram 2: CapAllianz Business Method 

 

As mentioned in the Board Statement, the Group operates principally in two core business 

segments, namely (i) investments and trading activities under CWX Investments and Preferred 

Mart; and (ii) oil and gas business under Loyz Thailand, which is primarily held through its 20% 

stake in the Concessions. As the Group is a minority stakeholder, the Group is thus reliant upon the 

operator and holder of a 60% stake in the Concessions (namely ECO Orient (as defined herein)) for 

all technical reporting and sustainability efforts. 

 

Investments and Trading Activities 

 

CWX Investments currently undertakes the Group’s investments and trading activities. CWX 

Investments has a 40% stake in Preferred Mart which has direct investments in a 100% stake in a 

supermarket business in Singapore that operates through a retail outlet and established e-

commerce platforms, and a 40% stake in a healthcare and wellness business in Singapore that 

offers affordable HBOT using patented Japanese technology. Whilst these new businesses are at 

their initial stage of operations, we believe these essential services are in the defensive consumer 

sector and are likely to pave the way for the Group to obtain a more balanced risk exposure on its 

investment portfolio. 




 

10 | Page 

 

 

Oil and Gas Business  

 

Loyz Thailand holds a 20% participating interest in three producing Concessions – SW1, L44/43, 

and L33/43, a strategic joint operation located in the Phetchabun Basin in Thailand, which currently 

generates a steady income stream from its existing oil producing wells.  

 

Loyz Thailand’s partners in the Concessions are ECO Orient Energy (Thailand) Limited, ECO Orient 

Resources (Thailand) Limited and the Berlanga Group (together with Loyz Thailand, collectively 

known as the “Joint Operation”). The Concessions are currently run by ECO Orient Energy (Thailand) 

Limited and ECO Orient Resources (Thailand) Limited (collective known as “ECO Orient”). ECO 

Orient are wholly-owned subsidiaries of ECO Environmental Investments Limited, which is a Hong 

Kong based energy company which focuses on the investment and management of a portfolio of 

new energy projects including energy infrastructure, chemical plants, oil and gas resources, as well 

as research and development. 

 

The production license for the SW1 Concession was renewed for another 10 years from July 2016, 

while production licenses for L44/43 and L33/43 Concessions are due to expire in 2032. Currently, 

there are thirteen production licenses covering an area of 124.7 square kilometres under these 

Concessions. 

 

Loyz Thailand will continue to harness the potential of the Concessions which have proven reserves 

for production within the untapped areas of the Concessions. This asset holds substantial proven 

reserves for development as well as significant potential for further exploration, promising value 

enhancement and sustainable long-term growth. 

 

The Group has diversified its business into the Consumer sector, and will continue to diversify its 

business to reduce reliance on the Concessions by diversifying its revenue stream, as well as 

improving prospects and better support the growth of the Group, in order to enhance shareholders’ 

value for the Group. 

Oil’s Supply Chain

Diagram 3: Oil’s Supply Chain Flowchart 

 

Financial Assistance Received from the Government 

 

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have dampened demand in local and global markets. 

This created multiple effects on the supply chains and has affected the Group’s revenue.  The 

Singapore government has stepped in to offer financial assistance to the local companies. 

Jobs Support Scheme  

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, the Singapore 

government had rolled out its Jobs Support Scheme (“JSS”) to provide wage support to employers 

to help them retain their local employees, comprising Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, 

during this period of economic uncertainty. This scheme was further extended till March 2021. 

Under the JSS, the Singapore government co-funded between 25% and 75% of the first S$4,600 of 

gross monthly wages paid to each local employee in a 10-month period up to August 2020 and 

between 10% and 50% of the same in the subsequent 7-month period from September 2020 to 

March 2021. Employers received five main JSS payouts in April 2020, July 2020, October 2020, 

March 2021 and June 2021 with an additional special payout in May 2020. The level and duration 

of support each employer receives depends on the sector in which the employer operates. 




 

12 | Page 

 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions continuing into 2021, the Singapore government rolled 

out an enhanced payout corresponding to wages paid between August and October 2021, which 

will be disbursed in December 2021.  

Rental Rebate 

As announced by the Ministry of Finance, to support businesses with rental costs during the two 

Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) (“P2(HA)”) periods, the Singapore government will provide rental 

support to Small and Medium Enterprises (“SMEs”) and eligible Non-Profit Organisations with an 

annual revenue not exceeding S$100 million, who are tenant-occupiers of qualifying commercial 

properties. For privately-owned commercial properties, some landlords have given rental waivers 

or rebates to support their tenants during the P2(HA) periods. In order to provide additional support, 

Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will disburse rental support cash payouts directly to 

qualifying tenants and owner-occupiers under the Rental Support Scheme. The first payout 

disbursed since 6 August 2021, while the second payout will be disbursed from 22 September 2021.

 ECONOMIC 

 

Markets Served 

Investments and Trading Activities 

CWX Investments is a Singapore-based investment company with key investments in Singapore. 

 

Oil and Gas Business 

The Group’s key asset is its 20% stake in the Concessions, which currently generates a steady 

income stream from its existing oil producing wells. The Joint Operation sells all of its produced oil 

to a single customer in Thailand. 

 

There are currently thirteen production licenses under the Concessions, covering an area of 124.7 

square kilometers. This asset holds significant proven reserves for development as well as 

significant potential exploration upside that may create value enhancement and sustainable long-

term growth. 

 

Through continual cost optimization efforts, coupled with higher oil prices in 2021, the operations 

of the Concessions are able to generate positive operating cash flows despite low oil production 

volume. This has spurred the Joint Operation to expedite plans to conduct a drilling campaign for 

five wells. The drilling campaign, which aims to increase oil reserves and oil production, is 

scheduled to commence in the last quarter of 2021, subject to the current state of COVID-19 

pandemic restrictions in Thailand. 

 

Please refer to the following sections in the Company’s Annual Report for FY2021 for detailed 

information on our financial results for FY2021: 

● Letter to Shareholders 

● Operations and Financial Review 

● Two-Year Key Financial Highlights 

● Independent Auditor’s Report (including the Notes to the Financial Statements)

 ENVIRONMENTAL 

 

The Group is acutely aware of the environmental impact on its business operations. Through our 

influence in the Group’s subsidiaries’ operations, we ensure that our environmental impact is 

minimized, health and safety standards are upheld and that all current laws and regulations are 

fully adhered to. We have stood firm and required that each of the Group’s subsidiaries meets the 

following (where applicable) in its operations: 

● Conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) prior to commencement of any 

development activity; 

● Assess energy efficiency at every level of operations, with the objective of minimizing 

energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases; 

● Ensure tracking, monitoring and reviewing of our environmental impact; 

● Implement a strict asset maintenance regime to eliminate spills and other contamination; 

● Educate and train our staff and subcontractors on our environmental policy and goals; 

● Meet or exceed the required environmental or regulatory legislation during our operational 

and development activities; 

● Implement office recycling, repurposing and upcycling especially usage of office paper 

printing; 

● Support creative design concepts for our development activities that utilize alternative fuels, 

reduce flaring and minimize facility size; and 

● Minimise carbon footprint by reducing electricity usage. 

 

When it comes to seismic and extraction operations, the Joint Operation has a strict corporate 

policy to reduce risks to as low as practicable and aims to continue to closely monitor our 

environmental targets both against legal limits and internal targets going forward.

Managing Exploration, Appraisal and Development Well 

Operations 

 

The following summarizes the activities undertaken by the Joint Operation in connection with 

exploration and appraisal drilling operations: 

 

● Well design and planning; 

● Well construction and handover or abandonment; 

● Prepare drilling facilities and worksites; 

● Management of well equipment and materials; 

● Selection and management of contractors; 

● Logistics management; and 

● Environmental and waste management. 

 

Waste Management 

 

The Joint Operation has a wastewater management plan that complies with all local laws and 

regulations. Each type of waste is segregated according to Thailand’s Department of Mineral Fuel 

(“DMF”), Ministry of Energy waste codes and management protocol. The quantity of each type of 

waste is carefully logged in the waste manifest system before being transported and treated by 

registered waste transporters and waste disposers respectively. 

 

Drilling cutting waste, which is non-hazardous, will be sent to the landfill to comply with the waste 

management plan, while mud/clay drilling waste, which is hazardous, will be sent to a cement kiln 

to be used as a raw material for the construction industry. 

 

DMF’s waste codes and management protocol go far beyond drilling operations with different 

codes for toxic water and various drilling muds, but also extends to the disposal of drilling hardware, 

filters, lubricants and containers. All our waste processing is expected to meet or exceed the 

guidelines set out in the initial EIA. 


 

 

16 | Page 

 

DMF’s waste codes and management protocol also extend to office waste, such as using different 

codes for different types of AA and AAA batteries as well as different classes of paper and 

cardboard for recycling. Office waste on site uses a septic tank in accordance with local regulations.  

 

The Joint Operation aims to continue to meet legal and regulatory requirements going forward.  

 

Biodiversity 

 

The Joint Operation has a reforestation programme around all the well sites within the 

Concessions, upon termination of the extraction, to encourage biodiversity. 

 

Emissions 

 

The laws of Thailand do not require air quality to be part of the EIA report. However, the Joint 

Operation goes above and beyond these environmental regulations and has put in place a system 

to monitor the air quality in the villages and communities near the drill sites to compare them with 

an established baseline before the project was started. To date, the Joint Operation has not 

recorded any deterioration in air quality attributed to the extraction operations within the 

Concessions. 

 

The Joint Operation will continue to monitor these environmental concerns going forward into 2022 

and beyond.

 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  

 

Health and Safety Policy 

 

The Joint Operation has a Safety Management System (“SMS”) policy in place with regular 

inspections and audits. The Joint Operation has designated three levels of responses, with an 

emergency response group with each level. The Joint Operation has a database of personnel 

charged with emergency management responsibilities. 

 

An Incident Response Team (“IRT”), which is located at the drill site in Wichian Buri, is trained to 

handle all envisaged incidents and emergencies alongside a country-level Emergency Response 

Group (“ERG”), which is based in Bangkok, Thailand. 

 

The ERG conducts regular tests of both procedures and equipment to ensure that they are always 

in a state of readiness along with regular training of all personnel to ensure everyone knows how 

to respond to an emergency. 

 

The IRT is the first responder to deal with all incidents and emergencies. The ERG provides 

support, advice and off-location assistance, communicates with authorities and next-of-kin and 

coordinates specialist support and recovery. Please refer to Diagram 4: Flowchart of Emergency 

Response for more information. 


 

 

18 | Page 

 

Diagram 4:  Flowchart of Emergency Response 

 

Control of Substances Hazardous to Health 

 

The Joint Operation is committed to eliminate, or control risks arising from the use of any 

hazardous substances that may present a health risk to employees. All such substances in use are 

carefully identified and any potential risks are evaluated. Internal controls will then be put in place 

to reduce that risk to an acceptable level. 

 

Although the Joint Operation provides suitable personal protective equipment (Personal Protective 

Equipment HSE-PM-004) for use by employees, this is not considered to be the primary control 

measure. Elimination or substitution with a less harmful substance is the preferred management 

option. 

 

The Production Assets Manager, or Project Manager, is responsible for implementing all the 

necessary precautions and controls and to ensure that the product has been assessed and any 

hazards/risks evaluated. 

 




 

 

19 | Page 

 

The Joint Operation provides all employees with an annual health check-up programme in 

accordance with the local laws and regulations in Thailand. Furthermore, all employees, who are 

involved with extraction and who may come into contact with crude oil, have to undergo additional 

periodic checks for benzene exposure through monitoring of their urine samples. 

 

The Joint Operation has an Environmental Management System with its own Health Safety and 

Environmental policy with clear procedures on oil spills, blowouts and chemical leakages. The Joint 

Operation understands its legal and financial responsibilities to clean up any pollution arising from 

its operations. The Joint Operation has contingency plans in place, which cover everything from 

exploration, drilling to loading. 

 

The drill sites are designed to protect underground water but nevertheless water quality is carefully 

monitored in case of any unforeseen contamination. Water samples are taken as a baseline before 

drilling and further samples are tested after drilling and after any level 2 oil spills. Samples are taken 

and tested in areas near to the drilling site. Regular annual testing is also performed. All drainage 

effluents are monitored and are currently within the limits of the pollution control department 

standards of Thailand. 

 

Similarly, surface water is monitored for contaminants with a baseline before and after drilling, after 

any incident and annually to ensure safety. 

 

Soil monitoring is conducted outside the boundary of the drill site, one upstream and one 

downstream. Soil samples are checked for a list of pollutants at the end of the first year of 

operations and every five years thereafter. 

 

The Joint Operation uses non-toxic drilling fluids in its operations. Muds are stored in a polyvinyl 

chloride (PVC)-lined sump that is constructed one meter above the site to ensure that they will not 

leak into groundwater or soils. 

 

Consideration is given to nearby residents, the closest of which are those living in a village two 

kilometers from the site. Trucks deliveries are minimised and limited to during daylight hours. 

 


 

 

20 | Page 

 

The majority of waste gas is re-used for heating in the separation process though a small amount 

is flared. Flaring has much less environmental and health impacts than venting of volatile 

hydrocarbons. Air quality samples are taken at regular intervals around the clock, not just at the 

site but also at three locations in three nearby villages. These results are carefully monitored for 

traces of toxics, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, and are reported to 

the local community. To date, there have been no incidents regarding pollution from flaring. The 

site also monitors and analyses PM10 soot as a by-product of flaring. 

 

The Joint Operation has set procedures for the end-of-life of a well once the project is at a close. 

Wellsite abandonment involves re-injecting sump liquids into the well or solidifying in a cement 

mixture, capping the well with cement and planting trees over the entire area as part of introducing 

biodiversity.

 PEOPLE 

 

Labour Practices and Decent Work 

 

The Group has a clear non-discrimination policy and also a strict anti-slavery and zero tolerance 

child labour policy which is communicated within the Group. 

 

We aim to continue our policies of zero child labour and anti-slavery and pay all employees their 

contractual salaries promptly. 

 

Employment 

 

The Group has a fair, non-discriminatory employment policy through a formally structured interview 

procedure. The Group recognizes the importance of training our entire staff in order to improve 

standards and boost morale. As the Group operates in the oil and gas industry, specific Health and 

Safety training is carried out and strictly overseen by both public and private bodies and this 

certification certifies not just our full time employees but also our contractors to ensure safety at 

all times. 

 

 

Labour/Management Relations 

 

Efficient communication within the organization, is essential for the SMS and other management 

systems to function effectively. The communication structure is designed not only for the passage 

of information but to motivate people through their involvement and understanding. It is recognized 

that well motivated employees contribute more towards the overall success of the Group. Regular 

meetings are held at the site, management and corporate levels to ensure operational safety as 

well as to motivate our employees.

Training and Education 

 

Here at CapAllianz, we believe in our employees and help them reach their fullest potential. The 

Group has regular training for employees at all levels. For instance, office staff are trained and kept 

up to date with the latest accounting standards, rules and regulations of the SGX-ST and related 

courses under the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and SkillFuture. At the end of each 

training programme, participants are asked to summarize and circulate key points learnt to the rest 

of the organization. In addition, the Group provides extensive safety training programmes to ensure 

that all staff are up to date with the latest safety procedures and new staff are made aware of the 

safety procedures in place.  We also encourage employees to further develop their skills by allowing 

for study leave. 

 

In FY2021, the Group conducted over 30 man-hours of training. Please refer to Table 1: Training of 

Staff for more information.

 GOVERNANCE  

 

Anti-Corruption 

 

CapAllianz will always act honestly, openly, fairly and ethically wherever we do business. We are 

committed to preventing corruption in all its forms and do not tolerate it in the course of our 

business or in those with whom we do business with. 

 

We strive to uphold all laws aimed at countering corruption in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 

 

CapAllianz has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and expects this of all staff, suppliers and 

business partners.  

 

Our policies encourage any employee who has any suspicion of bribery or other form of corruption 

to report the suspicion to the audit committee chairman where it will be dealt with appropriately 

and without fear of reprisal. 

 

The Group has instinctively known that a good and caring social programme is key to employee 

retention, which in turn, likely to improve employee productivity. We will continue to monitor these 

criteria and formalize our data collection going forward. 

 

The Group had zero corruption issues during FY2021 and aims to maintain this zero corruption 

record in 2022 and beyond. 

 

Enterprise Risk Management 

 

The Group has in place several risk management measures to manage its exposure to risks that 

are associated with the conduct of its business. Please refer to our financial statements set out in 

the Company’s Annual Report for FY2021 for more details. Going forward, we endeavor to further 

develop our risk management measures as our business diversifies.
