O

ver the past year, there has been an 

increasing focus on a green and 

resilient recovery from COVID-19 

globally and in Singapore. In February 2021, 

Singapore launched the national blueprint 

for sustainable development, the Singapore 

Green Plan 2030, signalling the nation’s 

resolve to work towards a net-zero aspiration. 

SIAEC recognises the importance and is fully 

committed to supporting decarbonisation. 

As part of the aviation ecosystem, we play an 

important role in contributing to the collective 

efforts to reduce carbon emissions generated 

by the aviation industry. In FY2020/21, 

we established the Sustainability Steering 

Committee to work closely with the Board on 

the sustainability strategy and direction, and to 

accelerate the implementation of sustainability 

initiatives in SIAEC. 

During the year, we achieved an important 

milestone of our plan to reduce SIAEC’s carbon 

footprint with the adoption of renewable 

energy in our operations. We installed solar 

photovoltaic systems on the roofs of our 

buildings and hangars, which would reduce 

our 

electricity 

consumption 

from 

non-

renewable sources by 20%. In addition, one 

of our hangars achieved the Building and 

Construction Authority’s Green Mark Platinum 

rating and Super Low Energy Building status, as 

well as Public Utilities Board’s Water Efficient 

Building certification. We have also enhanced 

our waste recycling programme and started to 

report waste and water data in this report. 

Our sustainability drive goes beyond SIAEC 

and extends to our Group companies. Our 

subsidiary in the Philippines has installed a 

solar photovoltaic system, which will be able 

to supply 15% of its electricity requirements. 

Several of our joint venture and associated 

companies 

have 

also 

installed 

solar 

photovoltaic systems at their facilities or are 

planning to embark on similar projects to tap 

solar energy for their operations.   

The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the 

lives and livelihoods of many people and 

economies globally. SIAEC Group’s businesses 

had not been spared and were severely 

impacted by the sharp reduction in flight 

activities. In response to this unprecedented 

crisis, tight cost controls were implemented. 

As the situation escalated, we had to introduce 

difficult measures including compulsory no-

pay leave, furlough and salary cuts. Surplus 

manpower was redeployed to support areas 

with increased demand, such as aircraft 

disinfection and preservation maintenance. 

Schemes were also rolled out to reskill and 

upskill employees during the downturn. These 

measures and support from the Singapore 

government have protected jobs and avoided 

layoffs. Throughout this difficult period, we 

maintained close communication with the 

unions and provided support to released 

contract employees, such as arranging job 

placement fairs to help them seek alternative 

employment opportunities. We are grateful 

to have received strong support from our 

employees and unions to manage costs, as 

well as the Singapore government for the 

wage support.

Protecting the health and safety of our 

workforce remains a priority during the 

pandemic. To safeguard the health and well-

being of our stakeholders, the Company 

implemented safe management measures and 

processes to keep our workplace safe. Under a 

rostered routine testing programme, frontline 

employees who are at risk of exposure to 

COVID-19 have to undergo regular testing, 

for early detection and to prevent spread 

of infections. Employees were also strongly 

encouraged 

to 

sign 

up 

for 

COVID-19 

vaccination when priority was given to the 

aviation community. As of July 2021, 92% of 

our workforce has received at least one dose 

of the vaccine. We have also set up a one-stop 

COVID-19 support portal for employees to 

access consolidated information on relevant 

regulatory updates, industry news, health and 

mental wellness tips and helplines. 

Arising from changes in the operating 

environment, we continually identify and 

put in place measures to manage new safety 

risks, such as aircraft towing in the congested 

airport due to the large number of parked 

aircraft. Following the success of our Aviation 

Safety Promotion Centre in 2019, we have set 

up the Workplace Safety Promotion Centre in 

FY2020/21 to augment existing safety training 

and programmes with the aim to reinforce 

workplace safety culture and mindset amongst 

our workforce.

In spite of the challenges brought about 

by the pandemic, we have not forgotten 

our commitment to contributing to the 

community. While several of our Corporate 

Social Responsibility (CSR) activities had to be 

suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions, our 

employee volunteers participated in community 

events where permissible. We continued to hold 

our annual charity run virtually and raised funds 

for beneficiaries of our CSR partner. 

Our focus on sustainable growth was not 

disrupted by the pandemic as we forged ahead 

with our vision to be the MRO service provider 

of choice. In January 2021, phase two of our 

Transformation programme was launched to 

better strengthen SIAEC’s value creation for 

our stakeholders, and support the aviation 

community’s recovery from the crisis. We 

are positioning ourselves to emerge stronger 

by optimising our operational processes 

through 

Lean 

methodology 

and 

digital 

tools, developing new technology-enabled 

products and services for customers and 

industry partners, and continually reskilling 

and upskilling our people. To this end, we are 

honoured and encouraged to be recognised 

and awarded the 2021 Asia-Pacific MRO of the 

Year Award by Airline Economics magazine. 

The recovery of the MRO business is 

contingent on the resumption of global air 

travel. The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations 

globally has provided some encouraging signs 

of growing confidence in international air 

travel, a more meaningful increase in flight 

frequencies and the subsequent demand 

for MRO services. Countries that are well-

advanced in their vaccination programmes 

and with effective containment measures 

in place are easing travel restrictions and 

re-opening their economies. Through our 

initiatives to drive sustainability, productivity 

and innovation, we aim to emerge from this 

crisis stronger and greener.

JV Portfolio

SIAEC has formed JVs and partnerships with original 

equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and strategic partners over 

the years to enhance our service offerings to customers. 

Together with our network of JVs covering different locations, 

we offer our customers a comprehensive suite of MRO 

services in the region and worldwide. 

To ensure a sustainable return on our investments, we are 

constantly reviewing our JV portfolio. In the year, we acquired

customers, employees, shareholders and local economies. The drive to enhance value creation provides impetus for continual 

innovation and transformation.  

Our operations also generate employment and contribute to the economies in the countries that we operate. In FY2020/21, 

the SIAEC Group generated S$443.0 million in revenue, and distributed S$247.5 million in operating costs, employee wages and 

benefits, interest payments and taxes. Please refer to the FY2020/21 Annual Report for more details on the economic value

CASE STUDY 

New Business Unit to  

Tap on Growth in the  

Engine Services Market

In February 2021, SIAEC set up 

a new business unit, Engine 

Services Division (ESD), to tap 

on growth in the aircraft engine 

services market. ESD will focus 

on increasing value to its OEM 

partners and airline customers, 

enhancing its integration in 

the engine MRO value chain 

and 

strengthening 

SIAEC’s 

engine 

services 

ecosystem. 

All 

engine-related 

services 

performed by the Company will 

be consolidated and developed 

under ESD, which will be 

the lead business channel to 

complement SIAEC’s network 

of engine JVs in Singapore. 

ESD will develop and provide 

a comprehensive portfolio of 

engine-related 

value-added 

services, 

including 

engine 

maintenance, 

parts 

repair, 

storage 

and 

preservation, 

material management, on-wing 

services and engine testing. 

ESD will also invest in a facility 

to 

accommodate 

growing 

demand in engine quick turn 

maintenance, 

where 

engine 

shop visits are driven by specific 

work to minimise engine time 

off-wing, thereby optimising 

both engine availability and 

reliability on-wing.

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

The Company’s push for digitalisation and the increase 

in telecommuting have underscored the importance of 

protection against cybersecurity threats and data privacy 

breaches. SIAEC is committed to proactively managing 

its information technology (IT) risks and maintaining high 

standards of data confidentiality through robust policies and 

governance structures. All employees are required to attend 

recurrent online training on information security. 

SIAEC adopts the SIA Group’s information security policy, 

which takes reference from the ISO/IEC 27001 standard on 

information security management. In addition, the Company 

leverages on the SIA Group’s IT infrastructure and maintains 

oversight of the systems relevant to SIAEC and conducts 

independent review to monitor that IT security infrastructure 

and networks are continually kept up with evolving 

threats. A Cyber Incident Response Team within the Crisis 

Management Directorate is in place to manage IT-related 

crises and responses in the event of a cybersecurity incident. 

Annually, the business units and support divisions conduct 

tests of business continuity plans to ensure preparedness 

and effectiveness of responses to disruptions on critical IT 

systems. Internal and external IT security audits, which include 

vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, are also 

conducted on SIAEC’s systems and platforms. To ensure cyber 

resilience of the SIAEC Group, IT audits and assessments are 

conducted on selected Group companies to ensure compliance 

with IT controls and where required, follow-up actions are 

introduced to improve standards and resilience.  

The management and use of our employees’, customers’ and 

suppliers’ data are governed by SIAEC’s Personal Data Protection 

Policy to ensure compliance with the Personal Data Protection 

Act. Any data privacy concerns can be raised to SIAEC’s Data 

Protection Officer. 

In view of COVID-19 and work-from-home arrangements, SIAEC 

has introduced various digital workflows in place of previous 

hardcopy approval workflows, such as in the area of invoice 

verification and approval. Employees working from home are 

given secure virtual private network (VPN) and virtual desktop 

infrastructure (VDI) access to office applications and resources. 

This provides an added measure of security over the Company’s 

data and resources when employees access them from home.

Thrust 2: Safety Management Systems

[403-1] [403-2] [403-7] [416-1] 

Safety Management System 

SIAEC’s Safety Management System focuses on 

effective safety management at the workplace and 

promotes safety ownership among our employees. 

Our Safety Management System is certified under 

ISO 45001: 2018 Occupational Health and Safety 

Management System (OHSMS) Standard, which 

covers all our MRO activities in Singapore.  

Our 

Safety 

Management 

System 

includes 

components such as safety roles and responsibilities, 

hazard identification and risk assessment process, 

training requirements, performance monitoring, 

audits and inspections, investigation process and 

the key safety procedures. To ensure continued 

relevance and effectiveness, the Safety Management 

System is reviewed annually.

Reporting safety-related matters is another important 

component of the Safety Management System.  All 

employees are required to report work-related 

incidents promptly to their immediate supervisor or 

section head. In addition, a confidential reporting 

hotline for quality or safety concerns is also available 

for our employees to provide anonymous feedback. 

These inputs facilitate analysis and safety intervention 

to be implemented. 

All work-related incidents4 are investigated under the 

supervision of the Vice President of Workplace Safety 

and Facilities. This includes issuance of a preliminary 

accident/incident report based on the initial 

investigation, and a final report which will identify risks 

and factors associated with the incident, corrective 

actions to be implemented and recommendations to 

improve the Safety Management System.

CASE STUDY 

SIAEC Workplace Safety Promotion Centre

Following the successful launch of the Aviation Safety 

Promotion Centre in 2019, SIAEC established the 

Workplace Safety Promotion Centre in FY2020/21 

to augment existing programmes and training on 

workplace safety with the aim to reinforce workplace 

safety culture and mindset amongst our workforce. 

The Centre focuses on workplace hazards and 

includes lessons learnt from past workplace accidents 

in the industry. The Centre offers an integrated 

learning environment combining classroom-based 

lessons and experiential and visual learning for 

participants. All employees are scheduled to attend 

the training at the Workplace Safety Promotion 

Centre. 

CASE STUDY

SIAEC  

Aviation Safety  

Promotion Centre

In 2019, SIAEC launched the Aviation Safety 

Promotion Centre, which is dedicated 

to raising awareness and importance of 

aviation safety. Being the first-of-its-kind 

in the MRO industry, the Centre highlights 

important lessons from past maintenance-

related aviation incidents through immersive 

media, informational displays and interactive 

activities. 

All employees are required to undergo an 

instructor-led training at the Aviation Safety 

Promotion Centre. As of 31 March 2021, 88% 

of operational employees and 39% of non-

operational employees have undergone the 

training. 

Maintenance  

Line Operations  

Safety Assessment

In 

FY2019/20, 

the 

Maintenance 

Line 

Operations Safety Assessment (M-LOSA) 

programme was introduced. The programme 

adopts a non-punitive and proactive approach 

to identify threats and errors, and address 

issues before incidents occur. To date, more 

than 80 employees have been trained as 

observers, with more than 1,440 observations 

gathered. All observations are analysed and 

addressed through action plans formulated. 

Thrust 3: Training and Communication 

[403-3] [403-4] [403-5] 

Training and Communication on Occupational Health and Safety 

SIAEC recognises the importance of having open communication with our employees 

to allow them to voice their concerns regarding occupational health and safety issues. 

As such, we actively involve our employees in the implementation and review of our 

safety management systems. This includes engaging our employees to identify and 

mitigate any potential work-related hazards, develop and review occupational health 

and safety procedures, and involve them in the discussions on occupational health and 

safety at Safety, Health and Environment Committee meetings, etc. We also promote 

a Just Culture and encourage employees to report errors so that the organisation can 

learn from the mistakes. 

To ensure all key stakeholders are kept informed and up to date with the latest 

occupational safety practices and requirements, the Safety, Health and Environment 

Handbooks are made available to all employees and contractors. All new employees 

and contractors are required to undergo safety awareness training conducted by 

qualified workplace safety and health officers before commencing work. For existing 

employees, we also conduct targeted health and safety courses for certain job 

functions to ensure employees carry out their work activities safely.

Training and Communication to Ensure Service Quality

To raise awareness on the importance of ensuring quality service and aviation safety, we 

provide regular training to our employees and communicate the latest information related 

to aviation safety via Quality &amp; Safety Briefing Sheets, Quality Notices, etc. Operational 

employees have to undergo specific training that are mandatory and recurrent, to refresh 

their knowledge and to keep them to date with the latest regulations and procedures. 

Listening to our customers’ needs is an important aspect of improving our service quality. 

We conduct annual customer engagement surveys to gather feedback, which will help 

us improve our services and enhance customers’ satisfaction.

Thrust 4: Partnering our Stakeholders on Safety

[403-7] 

SIAEC collaborates with our stakeholders through various partnerships and joint programmes to promote safety. Some of our key partners include the 

Changi Airport Group (CAG) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. SIAEC is also a member of the Singapore Airside Operations Safety Committee 

(SAOSC), which is chaired by the CAG. The main objective of the SAOSC is to provide a platform to discuss, resolve and decide on airside operational 

matters. 

The Airport Safety Awards is an initiative by the CAG to recognise the safety efforts of employees and partners of the airport community. SIAEC has 

been participating in the Airport Safety Awards since 2017 and is honoured to receive five awards in 2020. The awards are a testament to the Company’s 

commitment to building a strong safety culture.



EXAMPLES OF AWARD-WINNING SOLUTIONS 

• 

SIAEC’s Aviation Safety Promotion Centre, which focuses on educating employees on 

aviation safety through past maintenance-related aviation incidents, was recognised by 

CAG for demonstrating a positive disposition towards building a strong safety culture. 

• 

SIAEC’s Line Maintenance and Innovation &amp; Technology Divisions designed a system to 

prevent vehicular accidents that may be caused by driver fatigue. The system includes 

infrared detectors that can identify signs of fatigue or lack of attention, through eye-tracking 

algorithms and monitoring of facial movements. Upon detection of signs of possible fatigue, 

an audio alarm and seat vibrators will be activated to alert drivers. The system is also capable 

of generating reports for analysis. 

• 

A team of SIAEC employees came up with an initiative to install cameras at the rear end of 

the mobile lifts with markers displayed on the monitors. The cameras and markers serve to 

guide the drivers to position the mobile lifts accurately and safely.



Team members who spearheaded the establishment of 

the Aviation Safety Promotion Centre

SIAEC also seeks to promote a strong safety culture within our JVs, in particular the subsidiaries and JVs with management control. We actively engage 

the JVs on their safety performance, and render support and assistance as necessary.  These include conducting audits, providing training and advices and 

sharing of best practices and lessons learnt.

Ensuring Workplace Safety and Health amidst COVID-19

Working in the airport environment, our frontline employees face a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19. To prevent workplace infections, SIAEC coordinates 

with the authorities to schedule our frontline employees for regular rostered routine testing for early detection of COVID-19. In January 2021, Singapore’s 

aviation community was given priority for the COVID-19 vaccination. SIAEC encourages all employees to sign up for the vaccination to protect themselves 

and their families. A webinar was also organised to address employees’ concerns and queries regarding the vaccination. As of July 2021, 92% of our workforce 

has received at least first dose of the vaccine. We have also implemented safe management measures to ensure the safety of our employees. Underpinning 

our safe management measures are three pillars – Protection, Facilities and Monitoring.

Ensuring Service Quality amidst COVID-19

SIAEC is not spared from the business and operational disruptions arising from COVID-19. As part of our Aviation Safety Management System, we have conducted 

hazard identification and risk assessments and implemented mitigating measures to ensure that the quality of our services would not be compromised. 

As a result of reduced air travel in FY2020/21, there was a large number of parked aircraft, posing a challenge to carry out maintenance and towing activities 

in a congested airport. Some of the measures implemented include ensuring adequate marshallers during aircraft towing and limiting maintenance activities 

on aircraft parked at taxiways. 

In addition, as we redeploy our employees to areas with higher work demand, we are mindful of risks such as unfamiliarity with the new working environment 

and inherent safety hazards. To prevent these risks, all redeployed employees have to go through a safety induction training before commencing work in 

the new areas.  

Safe Management Officers:

• Appointed Safe Management Officers across all divisions to oversee and enforce 

safe management measures 

Personal protective equipment:

• Provided face masks for all employees 

• Provided full personal protective equipment for employees accessing aircraft cabin 

Safe distancing measures:

• Reduced number of employees on-site; for on-site employees, segregated teams 

to prevent risk of cross-infections 

• Implemented work-from-home arrangements for non-operational employees 

• Staggered mealtimes for crowd control 

• Virtual meetings by default

Handling suspect or confirmed infections: 

• Developed guidelines for employees who have come into contact with confirmed/

suspect cases, as well as employees who are unwell and exhibit relevant symptoms

Increased cleaning  

and disinfecting:

• Frequent cleaning 

and disinfection of 

high-touch areas 

(door handles, lift 

buttons, etc.) 

Social distancing:

• Reduced capacity 

of meeting 

rooms and set up 

demarcations in 

common areas 

• Limited canteen 

dine-in to reduce 

crowds and 

gatherings

Monitoring of safe 

management measures: 

• Inspection of work areas by 

Safe Management Officers 

to ensure adherence 

Monitoring of employees 

and screening of visitors:

• Implemented SafeEntry and 

subsequently, TraceTogether 

requirements 

• Temperature-taking and 

health screening for visitors

• Regular tests for COVID-19 

for frontline employees

resources and industrial relations risks.

Board’s Governance of Risk

[102-30] 

The Board, supported by various Board 

committees, maintains oversight of the key 

risks to the Group’s business. Annually, the 

Board reviews the adequacy and effectiveness 

of the risk management and internal control 

systems. In particular, the Board Safety and Risk 

Committee assists the Board in overseeing the 

adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 

management framework and policies.

The 

Management 

is 

responsible 

for 

the 

identification and management of risks, and 

ensuring that key risks are proactively identified, 

addressed and reviewed on an ongoing basis. To 

ensure the continuing relevance and adequacy of 

identified risks and the effectiveness of preventive 

and mitigating measures, the Group’s risk registers 

are reviewed every six months. During these half-

yearly reviews, close attention is also paid to the 

identification of new and emerging risks.

PERFORMANCE 

● Electricity consumption in FY2020/21 was 28% 

lower than FY2013/14 level

Note: Although electricity consumption surpassed 

the long-term target ahead of FY2021/22, the 

reduction was mainly attributed to reduced 

business activities caused by COVID-19. In 

FY2019/20 prior to COVID-19, the electricity 

consumption was 14% lower compared to 

FY2013/14 level and on track to exceed the long-

term target by FY2021/22.

● Carbon emissions intensity in FY2020/21 was 1% 

higher than FY2013/14 level

Note: Although carbon emissions were 45% lower 

in FY2020/21 compared to the previous year, 

a significant reduction in revenue resulted in 

an increase in the carbon emissions intensity. 

In FY2019/20 prior to COVID-19, the carbon 

emissions intensity was 18% lower compared to 

FY2013/14 level and on track to meet the long-

term target by FY2030/31.

● No environmental-related fines or non-monetary

Every Climate Action Matters

The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2021 shows that “failure of climate-change mitigation and adaption” has been rated as the number one 

long-term risk by impact8. The consequences of climate change are increasingly widespread, with more governments and businesses declaring “climate 

emergency” and taking actions to tackle climate change. Locally, the Singapore government has announced the Singapore Green Plan 2030 in February 20219 

which aims to secure a green, liveable and sustainable home for Singaporeans. 

SIAEC acknowledges that we have the responsibility to protect and preserve the environment for future generations. We are committed to operate in an 

environmentally responsible manner, continually explore sustainable solutions and contribute to the global efforts to combat climate change.

Energy and Emissions 

Management of Energy and Emissions 

A majority of SIAEC’s energy and emissions arises from the use of electricity to 

support daily MRO activities in our hangars, workshops and offices. 

To manage SIAEC’s energy and emissions, the Energy Management 

Committee comprising the Facilities Department and our building 

contractor, was set up in 2018 to monitor energy consumption and drive 

energy management programmes across SIAEC. 

SIAEC’s approach towards energy and emissions management includes 

reducing energy consumption and wastage and shifting towards cleaner 

sources of energy. Underscoring our commitment towards Singapore’s 

ambition to green 80% of Singapore’s buildings by 20309, SIAEC plans 

to achieve the Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) Green Mark 

Certification for all facilities moving forward. We also plan to deepen the 

engagement with our JVs to reduce the carbon footprint of the Group.

9 By gross floor area

Energy and emissions reduction initiatives at facilities: 

• Implemented an energy management control system that monitors energy consumption 

on an ongoing basis. In FY2020/21, SIAEC installed electricity submeters on our chiller 

systems and air compressors in our hangars to identify areas with high consumption

• Ongoing energy improvement plans to reduce energy consumption and wastage: 

&gt; Installation of motion sensors and replacement to light-emitting diode (LED) lightings at 

common areas and offices – approximately 35% in energy savings  

&gt; Use of efficient central chilled water system for buildings’ air-conditioning – 

approximately 45% in energy savings  

&gt; Installation of variable speed drives system on pumps – approximately 15% in energy 

savings 

Promote energy conservation 

• Encourage employees’ participation in “Earth Hour” event, a worldwide movement 

held annually where individuals, communities and businesses are encouraged to turn 

off non-essential lightings for one hour to raise awareness of the environmental issues 

facing our planet 

Adoption of solar photovoltaic systems: 

• Collaborated with Sembcorp Solar to 

install solar photovoltaic systems on the 

roofs of five hangars and the Engine Test 

Facility in FY2020/21. The system was 

operational as of January 2021

Shifting towards cleaner vehicles

• Undertook a feasibility study to replace 

our petrol and diesel-operated vehicles 

with electric vehicles

• Embarked on an operational trial of 

electric tow tractors, which emit 55% 

less carbon emissions compared to 

conventional tractors

CASE STUDY 

Greening our Operations

Singapore 

In 2020, SIAEC signed an agreement with Sembcorp 

Solar to install solar photovoltaic systems on the 

roofs of SIAEC’s hangars and Engine Test Facility. 

The system is made up of 8,206 solar panels 

covering about 17,000 sqm of roof space area. It is 

expected to generate 4,500 MWh of clean energy 

yearly, equivalent to powering 1,000 four-room 

HDB a year, and reduce the consumption of fossil 

fuel-generated electricity by 20%. 

Philippines  

In FY2020/21, our operations in the Philippines 

also embarked on a rooftop solar photovoltaic 

system project, which was commissioned in April 

2021. The system comprises 1,260 solar panels and 

is expected to supply 15% of the SIA Engineering 

(Philippines)’s electricity needs.  

CASE STUDY 

Greening our Buildings

In April 2021, SIAEC’s Hangar 2 was awarded the 

BCA Green Mark Platinum rating, the highest rating 

for Green Mark Certification by BCA. In addition, 

Hangar 2 was also awarded the Super Low Energy 

Building status, a category for recognition of best-

in-class energy performing Green Mark Building 

that achieves at least 40%* energy savings based 

on prevailing code.

10 Please refer to the Appendix for definitions and methodologies

* Equivalent to 60% energy savings above the 2005 

building code

In FY2020/21, the total energy consumption by SIAEC was 145 TJ, a 48% decrease from 279 TJ in FY2019/20. Correspondingly, 

our total GHG emissions was 13,323 tonnes of CO2e in FY2020/21, a 45% decrease from 24,177 tonnes of CO2e in FY2019/20. The 

reduction in total energy consumed and GHG emissions was largely attributed to a decline in MRO activities arising from the adverse 

impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry. The significant decrease in revenue has also impacted the GHG emissions 

intensity performance, which may not provide a meaningful comparison with previous financial years. In FY2020/21, our GHG 

emissions intensity was 30 tonnes CO2e/$million revenue. We will continue to monitor the performance in subsequent periods.

Towards Resource Circularity and Zero Waste

As with any country with a growing economy and population, Singapore 

is facing an impending waste and resource management issue. In 

response, Singapore has designated 2019 as the Year Towards Zero Waste 

and published a Zero Waste Masterplan to raise awareness on the waste 

situation in Singapore, and to articulate key policies and strategies that 

the government will be implementing to enable sustainable waste and 

resource management. 

Conscious that Singapore’s only landfill in Pulau Semakau is expected to 

run out of space a decade earlier than planned by 2035, SIAEC seeks to 

align ourselves with the Singapore government’s agenda. To play our part 

in advancing towards a zero-waste nation, SIAEC is committed to reducing 

our waste generated and to adopt a circular economy approach to increase 

our waste diversion. 

Management of Waste

[306-1] [306-2]

SIAEC’s waste is mainly generated from the MRO activities in our hangars 

and workshops. The three main pillars driving waste management at 

SIAEC include:

• Ensuring responsible disposal of waste 

• Reducing waste from our offices and operational activities 

• Raising awareness on the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) 

SIAEC’s waste journey started with paper conservation and recycling. Since 

then, we have expanded our focus to other types of waste including plastic, 

cardboard, scrap metal and electronic waste. The Recycling Committee 

comprising representatives from various divisions was established in May 

2019 to implement waste initiatives across the organisation as we work 

towards reducing waste across our operations.

Management of Supply Chain Risks

[308-1] [414-1]

As part of supply chain management, we have introduced processes to integrate sustainability in our supply chain approach and supplier selection process. 

SIAEC has in place a formalised process to identify and monitor sustainability risks in our supply chain. This involves conducting supplier risk assessments 

during the selection phase, requiring suppliers to adhere to SIAEC’s Supplier Code of Conduct and ongoing monitoring of suppliers’ compliance through 

questionnaires, audits and site visits by SIAEC’s personnel. For aircraft-related parts and services, there are stringent evaluation criteria to assess the 

qualifications and capabilities of the non-OEM suppliers or service providers before they can be appointed. 

Upon the award of contracts, all suppliers are expected to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct which sets out our ethical and business conduct 

requirements and is made publicly available to all suppliers (refer to our website for details). It covers areas relating to environmental standards for suppliers’ 

processes, products or services, child labour, working conditions, remuneration, occupational health and safety, anti-corruption/anti-bribery and business 

ethics. Compliance with this policy is an essential component for all our quotations, tenders and agreements. Any suppliers who are found to be in breach 

of the policy must take prompt corrective actions or risk termination of contract. Reinforcing the supply chain risk management process is our whistle-

blowing programme, which allows internal and external stakeholders to provide confidential feedback on possible improprieties by our suppliers.

In FY2020/21, no suppliers were found to have breached SIAEC’s Supplier Code of Conduct from our reviews. 

In November 2020, SIAEC enhanced the supplier selection process to screen all new suppliers16 on sustainability criteria. This involves suppliers filling up 

a questionnaire, audits and assessing suppliers based on their ability to meet minimum sustainability standards or requirements such as the ISO 14001. 

16 Screenings are performed only for purchases above $500k in contract value

• Suppliers are required to 

submit relevant sustainability 

track records, certifications or 

standards (ISO 14001, ISO 9001, 

ISO 45001, BizSafe Certification, 

etc.) in their proposals  

• New suppliers are required to 

fill up a questionnaire, which 

includes questions relating to 

environment and safety

• Supplier risk assessments are 

conducted during the selection 

phase to identify and mitigate 

sustainability risks and impacts

• Suppliers are required to 

comply with SIAEC’s Supplier 

Code of Conduct. SIAEC 

enforces these requirements 

through our purchase orders 

and agreements

• Ongoing monitoring 

of compliance through 

regular meetings, emails, 

teleconferences with suppliers

• Periodic review of suppliers’ 

performance to ensure suppliers 

comply with the established 

standards, procedures or key 

performance indicators

• Evaluate any breaches of 

Supplier Code of Conduct,

Our Employee Profile

[102-8] 

Our competent and talented workforce of executives, licensed aircraft 

engineers and technicians remain a cornerstone of SIAEC’s success. We 

are committed to building a fair and supportive work environment and 

culture for our people and organisation. The decrease in the number of 

our employees in FY2020/21 compared to the previous year was mainly 

due to manpower rationalisation measures taken to mitigate the surplus 

situation arising from the severe reduction in business activities during 

the year.

New Employee Hires and Employee Turnover 17 18

[401-1]

In FY2020/21, our hiring rate was 3.6% (FY2019/20: 5.3%) and our turnover 

rate was 8.9% (FY2019/20: 4.9%). The voluntary employee turnover rate 

was unchanged from FY2019/20 at 2.6%. The decline in hiring and increase 

in turnover rate were due to the Company’s measures to protect jobs and 

manage costs. We remain committed to inclusive recruitment practices and 

retaining diverse, qualified employees. For more information, please refer to 

Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Non-discrimination section.

Employee Satisfaction and Well-being

[403-6]

Our employees are SIAEC’s greatest asset. We seek to retain our human capital by ensuring employee satisfaction, welfare and well-being. To better 

understand our employees’ needs, SIAEC engages our employees through various activities, including biennial organisational climate surveys and regular 

employee pulse surveys. Our employee pulse surveys provide a channel for our people to voice their concerns and views. These surveys cover a range of 

topics including mindset shifts, operational improvements, employees’ sentiment towards changes and SIAEC’s Transformation initiatives. 

There are also initiatives to promote employee health and well-being, especially during COVID-19.  

• Complimentary basic health screening for 

all employees annually

• Subsidies from the Company for more 

comprehensive health check-ups every 

two years

• Portable Medical Benefits Scheme

• Free recommended vaccinations (yellow 

fever, etc.) for duty travels

• COVID-19 vaccination priority for aviation 

community; arranged shuttle services to 

vaccination facility

• Regular health talks and fitness activities 

(conducted virtually during COVID-19)

• Sharing of health tips via SIAEC’s in-house 

magazines 

• Monthly fruit days (prior to COVID-19)

• Organisation of sports, social and other 

recreational activities for employees, 

including interdivisional sports 

competitions and outdoor excursions 

(prior to COVID-19; most events were 

held virtually during COVID-19)

Performance Review

Our employees are rewarded based on their abilities, performance, contribution and experience. We believe in the importance of having regular performance 

reviews and dialogues between employees and their supervisors, to facilitate two-way feedback and alignment on goals and expectations. To further 

motivate and reward good performance, there are incentive schemes in place.   

Responding to Employees’ Needs During COVID-19 

With economic uncertainty impacting job security and work-from-home arrangements potentially leading to feelings of isolation, there is an increasing focus 

on employees’ mental well-being. In light of these concerns, SIAEC has made it a priority to support our people as they navigate and adjust to the new normal.

When the pandemic first broke out, SIAEC distributed masks 

to all its employees. In May 2020, a COVID-19 support 

portal was set up to facilitate employee engagement. 

Using this portal, employees could stay updated on the 

latest COVID-19 news and advisories, industry happenings, 

and resources for physical and mental well-being. To 

complement the portal, articles promoting mental wellness 

are periodically published in the Company’s newsletter, and 

posters with helplines for employees to reach out on mental 

health matters have also been put up at the work areas. 

Currently, employees have access to counselling services 

through doctor referrals provided by our medical benefits 

administrator. Recognising the importance of mental 

well-being even beyond the pandemic, we are planning 

to engage a dedicated counselling service provider for our 

employees to reach out to moving forward.

With operational activities significantly reduced due to the pandemic, SIAEC 

ramped up its efforts to reskill and upskill workers with an emphasis on 

aircraft-related training and skills in three key areas: Digital, Transformation 

&amp; Innovation, and Lean Process Improvement.

 

To ensure the continuity of training despite constraints posed by the 

pandemic, approval has been obtained from the regulatory authorities 

and government agencies to conduct training through videoconferencing 

platforms. Where in-person training is required, safe management measures 

are in place to safeguard the health of our people. These measures include 

reducing classroom capacity to allow for safe distancing and increasing the 

cleaning frequency of facilities.

Employees are also encouraged to upskill themselves through online courses. 

On a monthly basis, a curated set of recommended LinkedIn Learning 

courses would be disseminated to employees for their self-learning.

Ensuring Employee Well-being 

Upskilling for the Future



OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE FRAMEWORK 

Under the Operational Excellence 

Framework, employees in operations divisions 

are rewarded when they achieve operational 

targets. 

In FY2020/21, S$139,400 worth of grocery 

vouchers were issued to over 2,000 eligible 

employees in our operations divisions. In 

addition, over S$20,000 was disbursed for 

employee get-together sessions at the 

divisions.

STAR EMPLOYEE AWARDS

The quarterly STAR Employee Award 

recognises outstanding engineers, 

technicians and clerical employees. 

These employees have exemplified 

excellence in their work, rendered care 

and service beyond their normal course 

of duty, and consistently demonstrated 

the Company’s core values.

TRANSFORMATION CHAMPIONS

As the Company continues its Transformation journey, 

recognition is given to individuals and/or teams 

who have contributed to their respective divisional 

initiatives. Besides Transformation Champions, 

champions in the areas of Lean, Digital and Innovation 

are also recognised.

In addition, to encourage participation, an EVP 

Challenge Shield has been introduced to award the 

division with the most number of Champions every 

quarter.

CASE STUDY 

Building the Ecosystem through SIAEC Training Academy 

Our Training Academy is an approved Maintenance Training Organisation recognised by 

civil aviation authorities across the world, a training provider recognised by SkillsFuture 

Singapore for continuing education and training, and a Workforce Skills Qualifications 

Approved Training Organisation. Through our robust curriculum of ab-initio and 

specialised aerospace and aircraft-related courses, the Training Academy supports the 

training needs of our employees, JVs and strategic customers/partners, and helps to 

build a pipeline of talents for the growing demand for qualified and skilled technical 

personnel in the aviation industry.  

Aerospace Professional Conversion Programme

The Academy has been appointed by Workforce Singapore as the Programme Manager 

for the Aerospace Professional Conversion Programme. This placement programme 

aims to help professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) transition 

into new occupations by reskilling them for new job roles in fleet management, quality 

assurance, technical services, workshop engineering, structural maintenance and cabin 

retrofitting works.

Integrated Work Study Program in Collaboration with Singapore Institute of 

Technology

SIAEC, in collaboration with Singapore Institute of Technology, jointly delivers a three-year 

direct honours degree programme leading to a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours 

in Aircraft Systems Engineering. The programme incorporates an eight-month Integrated 

Work Study Programme at SIAEC, which also grants qualified students with a Certificate of 

Recognition recognised by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Graduates from this 

programme will help to fulfil the manpower demand from the aviation and MRO industry 

in Singapore, including SIAEC’s need for licensed aircraft engineers. In September 2020, 

the Programme saw an increase in the student intake for the third cohort.

Work Study Certificate and Diploma in Collaboration with Temasek Polytechnic 

and Institute of Technical Education

SIAEC and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Singapore Aero Support Services, are 

collaborating with Temasek Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education in the Work 

Study Certificate and Work Study Diploma respectively. The two programmes create 

additional pathways for local graduates to explore careers in the aviation industry and 

provide a pipeline of cabin trainee technicians for SIAEC. Students undergo a structured 

programme at the institutes of higher learning and SIAEC. The programme at Temasek 

Polytechnic commenced in 2019 and had two trainee intakes to date. The Work Study 

Diploma is set to have its first intake in 2021. 

Building Workforce for the Future

[404-1]

For SIAEC to achieve business resilience and excellence, nurturing a competent workforce 

with a future-ready skillset is essential. Our employees enjoy myriad structured training 

and development programmes that build both technical competencies and soft skills. In 

FY2020/21, S$5.3 million was invested in the training of our people. The average training 

hours per employee increased compared to the previous year as the Company used the 

downturn to ramp up the training of our workforce. The average training hours for male 

employees are higher than female employees as the operations divisions, which consist of 

a higher proportion of male engineers and technicians, sent more employees for training 

during the prolonged period of low workload.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to accelerate the retirement of older fleet types, which will 

impact the MRO business demand as newer aircraft require less maintenance. In preparation 

for the post-COVID operating landscape, SIAEC used the opportunity of reduced maintenance 

activities during the pandemic to upskill its workforce with training on new-generation aircraft 

and digital competencies. SIAEC has also been working with the Singapore Polytechnic on a 

structured training needs analysis framework that will help our employees attain competencies 

needed for their jobs, enabling them to excel in their career. Additionally, as part of SIAEC’s three-

year Transformation programme which will run from 2021 to 2023, targets have been set for a 

number of employees to attend applicable training programs in the following three key areas:

DIVERSITY, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

[405-1] [406-1]

Operating in an increasingly diverse environment with employees of various backgrounds, ensuring diversity and equal opportunity is an important aspect of 

SIAEC’s human capital management. 

Our people management policies and processes are guided by the principles of inclusion and equal opportunity. Notwithstanding the nature of MRO work which 

typically attracts more males to join the industry as engineers and technicians, we are committed to increasing the proportion of our female workforce and 

retaining female talents at all levels. We welcome Women in Aviation International, a non-profit organisation dedicated to the encouragement and advancement 

of women in all aviation career fields and interests, in the establishment of its Singapore Chapter, which will further advocate for more women to join the industry.  

We seek to prevent the occurrence of discriminatory practices not limited to nationality, ethnicity, gender, religion, age and disability. Alleged incidents of 

discrimination can be reported to the employees’ superiors or via our whistle-blowing channels, which will be duly investigated. In FY2020/21, there were no 

reported cases of discrimination.

SIAEC is committed to ensuring fair employment terms for all our employees and maintaining good industrial relations with our union partners. 86% of SIAEC’s 

executive employees, engineers, technicians and general employees are currently covered by collective agreements with our unions. We actively involve our 

unions through formal and informal engagement, including regular meetings between Management and unions to discuss workforce-related matters and to 

provide updates on SIAEC’s business outlook and initiatives. 

In support of the National Trade Union Congress’s goal to form Company Training Committees (CTCs) with at least 1,000 companies to provide workers with 

training co-developed by unions, training providers and institutes of higher learning, SIAEC has formed a CTC with our unions in 2019. The CTC serves as a 

platform for the Company and our unions to discuss matters relating to the training needs and programmes for our employees.

All our labour practices adhere to the Employment Act and other employment-related laws. SIAEC ensures that reasonable advance notices are provided 

to employees and unions before implementation of any significant operational changes. These notice periods are not detailed in the collective agreements 

as they could vary depending on circumstances. The collective agreements also set out the labour grievance mechanisms. 

Since the start of the pandemic, Management has been providing regular updates to the unions. These updates include industry news, the impact of 

COVID-19 on SIAEC’s performance and the manpower situation amidst the challenging operating environment. We are grateful for the support from the 

unions on the operational and cost management measures that the Company has taken.

Unions are also kept abreast of the latest initiatives and progress of Phase 2 of SIAEC’s Transformation programme through monthly Transformation 

Steering Committee meetings and periodic meetings with the Management.

Local Communities 

Action Against Poverty and Hunger

[413-1] 

In the spirit of our CSR motto of ‘Enabling People, Improving Lives’, we strive to make a difference to the lives of the underprivileged in the communities 

where SIAEC operates. The two pillars driving our CSR strategy are access to food and having a decent place to live. Our CSR activities are centred around 

providing food and housing aid to communities in Singapore and Southeast Asia through our partnerships with organisations such as Food from the Heart, 

Community Chest and Habitat for Humanity. We have plans to expand our CSR initiatives to include environmental outreach activities.    

As a result of the restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, SIAEC had to scale down our community development efforts in FY2020/21 to protect 

the health and safety of our employees and beneficiaries. In spite of the challenges, SIAEC remains committed to giving back to the local communities. 

Access to Food 





SIAEC’s Annual Charity Run is typically held at one of the Wildlife 

Reserve Parks in Singapore. Due to COVID-19, we held a month-

long charity run virtually in November 2020. All proceeds raised were 

donated to our adopted charity, Food from the Heart. 

Founded in 2003, Food from the Heart is an independent non-profit organisation with a 

vision to alleviate hunger in Singapore through food distribution programmes. As of end-

2020, Food from the Heart has reached out to over 53,000 beneficiaries across Singapore.

A Decent Place to Live





Founded in 2004, Habitat for Humanity is an international non-profit 

organisation that helps families build and improve homes. 

Annually, a team of employee volunteers from SIAEC will participate in overseas 

outreach programme in Southeast Asia. During these outreach programmes, 

volunteers will help to improve the living conditions of the less fortunate by 

constructing new homes. Due to the travel restrictions this year, the overseas 

outreach programme was suspended. 

Staying true to our commitment, SIAEC organised a team of volunteers to 

participate in Habitat for Humanity’s local programme, Project HomeWorks in 

FY2020/21. The team worked with vulnerable persons and families who needed 

help to clean up their homes. 

Established in 1983, Community Chest was set up to raise funds for social service agencies in Singapore. The public 

funds raised are channelled to programmes that provide direct social support services to the disadvantaged in 

Singapore. These include children with special needs, youths-at-risk, low-income families, adults with disabilities, 

isolated seniors and persons with mental health conditions.

In FY2020/21, SIAEC was a bronze sponsor for Community Chest Fú Dài. This is an annual event where volunteers 

pack and deliver Fú Dài to more than 6,000 seniors and families. Volunteers from SIAEC participated in this event 

and delivered Fú Dài to seniors and low-income families. All donations raised through this event were channelled 

to more than 80 social service agencies supported by Community Chest.

Greenhouse 

Gas (GHG) 

Emissions and 

GHG Intensity

Definition and boundary: 

GHG emissions refer to gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation. The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard was 

adopted for the reporting of SIAEC’s GHG emissions. SIAEC accounts for GHG emissions using operational control criteria to report its direct (Scope 1) and electricity indirect 

(Scope 2) GHG emissions. GHG emissions reported covers SIAEC’s operations in Singapore.

• Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions: Direct GHG emissions occur from sources that 

are owned or controlled by SIAEC, expressed in kilograms of carbon dioxide 

(kgCO2), kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (kgCO2e) or multiples. These 

include emissions from fuel consumption. Emission factors used are as follows: 

For diesel, petrol and jet kerosene, CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were 

included in the GHG calculation. Default emissions factors were sourced from the 

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories while the global 

warming potential (GWP) values were sourced from the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment 

Report (AR5).

• Electricity indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions:  Indirect GHG emissions from the 

generation of purchased electricity consumed by SIAEC Hangars 1 to 6, Engine 

Test Facility, airport operations at Changi Airport and Training Academy, expressed 

in kilograms of carbon dioxide (kgCO2) or multiples. A location-based method was 

adopted to reflect the average emissions intensity of the national grid on which 

energy consumption occurs. 

Emission factors were sourced from Energy Market Authority’s (EMA) Grid Emission 

Factor (GEF) annual publication on energy statistics in Singapore. For consistency,  

the grid emissions factor (GEF) used for the reporting year was sourced from the 

latest published factor at time of publication. SIAEC adopted the Average Operating 

Margin figures which measures Singapore’s system-wide emissions factor.

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK


Greenhouse 

Gas (GHG) 

Emissions and 

GHG Intensity 

(Cont’d)

Definition and boundary (Cont’d):

• Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions: Other indirect GHG emissions that 

are a consequence of SIAEC’s activities but occur from sources that are not 

owned or controlled by SIAEC. SIAEC currently does not report on Scope 3 

GHG emissions but may be monitoring and reporting on our Scope 3 GHG 

emissions moving forward. 

GHG emissions intensity methodology: 

Total GHG emissions intensity ratio for SIAEC is expressed in kgCO2e/$mil. The 

organisation-specific metric (the denominator) used was SIAEC Group revenue 

(includes subsidiaries) in the reporting year to align with financial reporting. 

Types of GHG emissions included in the intensity ratio are direct Scope 1 and 

energy indirect Scope 2 emissions. Gases considered in calculation includes 

CO2, CH4 and N2O.

Restatement:  

Direct (Scope 1) and Electricity Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions for past 

reporting cycles (FY2017/18, FY2018/19, FY2019/20) have been restated to 

reflect updated emission factors. 

Changes in reporting scope:  

In FY2020/21, we redefined our reporting boundary for GHG emissions and 

GHG emissions intensity to include SIAEC Hangars 1 to 6, Engine Test Facility, 

airport operations at Changi Airport and Training Academy. 

Water and 

Effluents

Definition: 

Refers to total water drawn for the organisation’s use, expressed in cubic metre 

(m3) or multiples. All water withdrawn by SIAEC is water drawn from the Public 

Utilities Board (PUB), a third-party water provider in Singapore. Water provided by 

PUB is considered freshwater as Singapore’s quality of drinking water is regulated 

by the Environmental Public Health (EPH) (Water Suitable for Drinking) (No.2) 

Regulations 2019 which follows the World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines 

for Drinking-water Quality (≤1,000 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids).

Boundary:   

Water withdrawal reported covers SIAEC’s operations in Singapore including 

SIAEC Hangars 1 to 6, Engine Test Facility, airport operations at Changi Airport and 

Training Academy.

Definition of effluents: 

Refers to treated or untreated wastewater that is discharged such as any liquid, 

including particles of matter and other substances in suspension in the liquid, 

which is the outflow from any trade, business or manufacture or of any works of 

engineering or building construction. 

This definition is based on the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), AWS 

International Water Stewardship Standard, Version 1.0, 2014 and Singapore’s 

Sewerage and Drainage Act (Chapter 294).

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK


Waste

Definition: 

Refers to anything that the holder discards, intends to discard, or is required to discard expressed in kilograms (kg) or multiples and excludes effluents. 

This definition is based on the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their 

Disposal, 1989. 

• Hazardous waste:  Waste that possesses any of the characteristics contained in 

Annex III of the Basel Convention, or that is considered to be hazardous by national 

legislation. This includes toxic industry waste as defined by the National Environment 

Agency as wastes which by their nature and quality may be potentially detrimental 

to human health and/or the environment and which require special management, 

treatment and disposal.

This definition comes from the UNEP, Basel Convention on the Control of 

Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, 1989.

In Singapore, the handling of toxic waste is highly regulated and only licensed toxic 

waste contractors can collect, treat and dispose toxic industrial waste. 

• Waste diverted from disposal:  Any operation wherein products, components of 

products, or materials that have become waste are prepared to fulfil a purpose in 

place of new products, components, or materials that would otherwise have been 

used for that purpose (reuse, recycling, etc).

This definition comes from the UNEP, Basel Convention on the Control of 

Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, 1989.

At SIAEC, most of our waste are diverted through recycling activities. Recycling refers 

to any operation wherein products, components of products, or materials that have 

become waste are prepared to fulfil a purpose in place of new products, components, 

or materials that would otherwise have been used for that purpose. 

This definition is based on the UNEP, Basel Convention on the Control of 

Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, 1989.

• Waste directed to disposal:  Refers to the end-of-life management of discarded 

products, materials, and resources in a sink or through a chemical or thermal 

transformation that makes these products, materials, and resources unavailable for 

further use (incineration with or without energy recovery, landfilling, etc).

This definition is based on the European Union (EU), Waste Framework Directive, 2008.

In Singapore, licensed waste contractors transport incinerable solid waste to the 

waste-to-energy plants for incineration (Tuas, Senoko, Tuas South and Keppel 

Seghers Tuas Waste-To-Energy Plant). Incinerated ash and other non-incinerable 

wastes are then disposed at Singapore’s offshore landfill, Semakau Landfill. 

Boundary: 

Waste generated, diverted from disposal and directed to disposal reported covers SIAEC’s operations in Singapore including SIAEC Hangars 1 to 6, Engine Test Facility, airport 

operations at Changi Airport and Training Academy.

Turnover or 

Resignees

Definition:

Refers to employees who leave the organisation voluntarily or due to 

dismissal, retirement, or death in service.

Boundary:  

Turnover levels reported covers SIAEC’s operations in Singapore. 

Turnover rate methodology: 

Computation of employee turnover rates is based on number of resignees 

divided by total employee strength at the end of the reporting period.

Restatement: 

In FY2020/21, prior year turnover rates were restated. Turnover rates in prior 

years’ sustainability reports were computed based on voluntary employee 

resignations divided by total employee strength at the end of the reporting 

period. These have been recomputed in FY2020/21, based on the number 

of employees who leave the organisation voluntarily or due to dismissal, 

retirement or death in service divided by total employee strength at the end 

of the reporting period. 

Health 

Promotion  

Definition:

Refers to any initiatives to enable employees to increase control over and 

improve their health. These activities are identified by terms and phrases

of training hours provided to employees divided by total employee strength at 

the end of the reporting period. 

The breakdown of average training hours per employee by gender is tracked 

and reported starting FY2020/21.

Total training spend includes overheads incurred by SIAEC Training Academy. 

Overheads in FY2020/21 were lower due to the wage support provided by the 

Singapore government through the Jobs Support Scheme.

Restatement:  

In FY2020/21, prior year average training hours per employee were restated. 

Average training hours per employee in prior years’ sustainability reports were 

computed based on total training hours divided by average of the employee 

headcount as at the end of each quarter. For alignment with GRI 404-1 

reporting recommendations, the computation methodology has been revised 

from this reporting year onwards.

Discrimination

Definition:

Refers to act and result of treating persons unequally by imposing unequal 

burdens or denying benefits instead of treating each person fairly on the 

basis of individual merit. Also includes harassment, defined as a course of 

comments or actions that are unwelcome, or should reasonably be known to 

be unwelcome, to the person towards whom they are addressed.

Boundary:
