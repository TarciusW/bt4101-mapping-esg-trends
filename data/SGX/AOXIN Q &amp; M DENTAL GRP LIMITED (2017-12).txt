Board Statement

We are pleased to publish and share with you our inaugural

Sustainability Report which is in accordance with the Global

Reporting Initiative (GRI). We concluded our first materiality

assessment which helped us to identify topics which are

it demonstrates how we incorporate our sustainability effort

into our strategy and business operations, as well as our

commitment to engage with our stakeholders.

We take pride in being one of the leading providers of dental

services, equipment and supplies in the Liaoning Province,

Northern People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) with 11 dental

centres, comprising 4 dental hospitals and 7 polyclinics, as at

31 December 2017. As such, we recognise the importance in

maintaining close ties with the community.

We treat our customers as partners of our business and we

have continuously form strong collaborations with synergistic

parties that continue to aid us in solidifying our future

prospects, giving us greater market presence and access to

the latest dental and oral health developments.

This Sustainability Report provides an overview of the

Group’s vision, strategic approach and performance in the

material sustainability topics related to our business. The

products and services. This also serves as the foundation of our organisation as one of the

leading providers of private dental healthcare.








Organisational Profile

Supply Chain Management

Maintaining sustainability throughout our

supply chain requires regular monitoring

and review of our suppliers’ performance

against

the

Group’s

sustainability

principles.

We have a Procurement Policy in place

which sets our guiding principles on our

suppliers’ assessment against the Group’s

sustainability criteria.

We

have

entered

into

long-term

distribution agreements of one (1) to four

(4) years with suppliers such as Songfeng

Dental Equipments (Shanghai) Trading Co.,

Ltd.（松风齿科器械贸易（上海）有限

公 司 ） ,

Shanghai

Pinrui

Medical

Equipment Co., Ltd (上海品瑞医疗器械设

备有限公司) and Satelec （赛特力）.

Under these distribution agreements, we

have distribution rights for brands such as

Acteon-Satelec

and

Shofu

Dental

for

certain provinces such as the Liaoning

Province in Northern PRC.

From time to time, we may bid for tender

contracts with hospitals to deliver dental

equipment and supplies. Such contracts

may either have a contractual obligation to

deliver a fixed number of products or have

a fixed tenure to supply dental equipment

and supplies as and when required.

In addition, we intend to consolidate the

infrastructure of our dental equipment and

supplies business with the supply chain of

our dental centres. By managing our dental

equipment and supplies business as well as

the procurement needs of our dental

centres, we are better positioned to obtain

volume discounts from our suppliers and

ensure continued sustainability of our

supply chain.

External Initiatives

Bearing Aoxin Q &amp; M’s spirit in mind, we

are

making

an

effort

to

integrate

sustainability into our operations. Where

possible, we will consider sustainability

issues in our decision-making processes.

We have increased our exposure to the

paediatric dental health market as well as

the medical insurance market. We will hold

free clinic and treatment sessions on

holidays and on “Oral Care Day”. Paired

with our marketing and media campaigns

through online and traditional methods,

we are able to adopt a complete approach

towards our outreach program, as well as

raising dental health awareness and our

reputation in the region. These initiatives

are in line with our corporate concept of

giving back to the community and allow us

to integrate Aoxin Q &amp; M’s values into our

business decisions such as being creative in

our methods, and at the same time,

ensuring top quality service.

We have also collaborated with leading

academic institutions and often paid visits

to kindergartens, schools and communal

space to organize educational talks on oral

care. With the relationships forged, we are

collaborating

with

Jinzhou

Medical

University, to provide, amongst others,

instruction and training to students and

dental professionals. Notably, pursuant to

such collaboration, a few of our dental

centres are designated as training centres.


Organisational Profile

9

Our

stomatology

training

centre

at

Shenyang is equipped with a multimedia

teaching hall, a multi-function simulation

laboratory and a technical laboratory to

ensure that aspiring dentists are equipped

with the relevant technical skills before we

allow them to practise on patients.

Dr. Shao, who is also the Dean of Jinzhou

Medical University, Shenyang Department

of Stomatology, actively participates in the

learning and growth of the undergraduates

through conducting lectures and reviewing

their progress.

The

stomatology

training

centre

at

Shenyang is also accredited by Jinzhou

Medical University for undergraduate and

post-graduate training. Students graduate

from this training centre with dental

qualifications

will

be

recognised

by

universities in China. Currently, this is the

only

training

centre

accredited

by

university in China.

Award of Certificates and Recognition

Aoxin Q &amp; M is committed to conduct our business in a responsible and sustainable manner.

We have therefore aligned our operations and business practices with industry/market

accepted principles and standards. In recognition of our efforts, the Group was awarded the

ISO 9001:2008 certification in 2015, which demonstrated our ability to be consistent in

providing our services that meets the customers and the relevant statutory and regulatory

requirements.

In 2009, approval was given by Liaoning Medical College for the establishment of a clinical

skills training centre based in Shenyang to provide training and to continuously uphold the

standard of dental professionals. Furthermore, approval was also given by Liaoning Medical

College to establish the Liaoning Medical Institute of Stomatology for Aoxin Q &amp; M to provide

training and opportunities for graduates.

In 2015, Shenyang Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Branch Hospital met the standards set by

Liaoning Medical College and qualities reviewed by experts in the field. As such, approval was

given for the establishment of Shenyang Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Branch Hospital.

In 2016, Shenyang Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Branch Hospital entered into a mutual

agreement with Liaoning Medical College which enables the ease of sharing of knowledge in

the field of dentistry. Given the medical facilities and resources that Liaoning Medical College

has, and the training opportunities we provide to aspiring dental professionals, the

agreement proved to be beneficial to both parties. At the same time, it ensures that the

professional standards of our dental professionals and services are always improving.

Governance and Sustainability Approach

15

Our governance of sustainability of the

Group

encompasses

two

business

segments, i) provision of dental services;

and ii) distribution of dental equipment

and supplies.

Our

Board

of

Directors

oversees

sustainability issues and key governance

processes across the Group, including

policies,

procedures

and

engagement

activities for material ESG factors. Senior

management

will

coordinate

and

implement

ESG

factor

management,

including coordination and communication

to the Board.

To enhance our corporate governance

structure,

we

have

established

a

committee to oversee the standards of our

dental

professionals

and

our

dental

services. The roles and responsibilities of

this committee includes the following:

a)

the provision of clinical governance for

our dental professionals and staff;

b)

e)

the resolution of any disputes and

complaints by patients.

Our

experienced

technicians and engineers, who routinely

check the dental equipment and supplies

from our suppliers. We provide strong

aftersales support to ensure customer

satisfaction. These are our approaches

towards

risk

management

in

daily

operations.

We

comply

with

all

PRC

laws

and

regulations in relation to quality standards,

and we constantly seek feedback from our

dental

Accountability to Stakeholders

The feedback arising from our stakeholder engagements, which includes inputs on our

sustainability reporting and materiality of topics, has helped strengthen the relevance of our

reporting and approach to managing the Group’s material issues. We understand the need to

maintain close relationships with our stakeholders to support us in addressing sustainability

challenges. Hence, we regularly engage with and consult our diverse groups of stakeholders.

We seek to understand more of our stakeholders’ expectations to identify areas which could

be improved on.

Material Topics

17

Our material issues are identified based on the economic impacts and the degree of influence

they have on stakeholder assessments and decisions. In light of fresh stakeholder feedback,

new trends in sustainability, challenges facing the industry, experts’ views and our own

business goals, we considered several topics that are material to our stakeholders. Therefore,

we focus our sustainability efforts on these issues.

The following Materiality Matrix summarises our list of relevant sustainability topics and

ranking results. The topics are ranked and evaluated based on our engagement process with

respective stakeholder groups. We will review our material topics yearly in light of fresh

stakeholders’ feedback and updates to our business objectives and developments.

Economic Performance

18

At Aoxin Q &amp; M, we constantly seek ways to create value for shareholders and stakeholders

through long term sustainable business growth strategies.

Most notably, we seized the opportunity by entering the growing paediatric dentistry market

and secure our market position as one of the leading dental service providers in the region.

This move contributed to a rise in revenue, and at the same time, pushes demand for large-

scale development of orthodontic and orthographic surgery centres in the future.

For FY2017, the Group’s revenue from healthcare and distribution of dental equipment and

supplies business have increased by 7% and 28% from FY2016 respectively. The growing

demand of private dental healthcare, especially in the areas of paediatric dental care has led

to increase in the Group’s revenue. We received warm welcome from the community that we

currently based our efforts in. This has served as an encouragement to us and we believe that

with our expansion to other provinces, the Group’s revenue will be sustainable in the long

term.

Subsequent reporting for FY2018

For FY2018, the Group hopes to maintain and ensure its financial stability and generate

positive returns to its stakeholders.

Please refer to Annual Report 2017 page 4 to page 9 for the financial highlights and review of

the Group.


Anti-Corruption

19

As noted from Clifford Chance Financial Markets Toolkit “Anti-Bribery and Corruption Review”

dated June 2017, the PRC government has stepped up its anti-bribery efforts to reduce

improper payments and other benefits received by staff in connection with the purchase of

pharmaceutical and medical equipment and supplies, and the provision of healthcare services.

We are pleased to report that Aoxin Q &amp; M does not have any confirmed incidents of

corruption and we intend to maintain this record. We strictly enforce our values and ensure

that our stand on corruption is clear. We recognize the importance of upholding our values

to obtain the trust and respect of our stakeholders.

Aoxin Q &amp; M adopts a strong stand against bribery and corruption. Additionally, we also adopt

a preventive approach to corruption. As such, we have in place a whistle blowing policy for

employees, as employees are usually the first to discover any irregularities within the Group.

This provides proper avenues for employees to raise concerns about actual or suspected

improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters and receive feedback on any

action taken.

We recognise that we can never rule out the possibility of corruption not happening and the

journey to stamp out corruption is a long tedious process. In the early stage of establishing a

code of conduct among employees, we have distributed handbooks on work behavior

standard that we expect employees to conform to. As the Group develops, we will constantly

revise the employee manual and ensure its relevance in today’s world.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2018

The Group hopes to maintain its clean record for corruption cases and continues to cultivate

anti-corruption environment and training for its employees.


Energy

20

After our first materiality assessment, we identified several areas for improvement. We are

optimistic that we can reduce our carbon footprint for subsequent periods. We strive to

innovate and explore ways in which we can reduce water and energy consumption through

energy efficiency usage and encouraging renewable energy sources.

Environmental protection is one of the eight priorities in China’s Government Work Plan for

2016. To help address the issue, China’s National Energy Administration has pushed for more

wind turbines to be installed during the five-year (2016 to 2020) period. Over the next five

years, water consumption, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP

should fall by 23%, 15% and 18% respectively. The number of days with good urban air quality

is targeted to exceed 80% by 2020.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2018

Moving forward as an environmentally conscious player in the dental industry of China, we

pledge to increase our sustainable efforts and communicate our goals to the employees of

Aoxin Q &amp; M. An example would be to have the goals and strategies, such as implementation

of the 3 Rs: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, outlined and displayed in all of our offices to motivate

our staff.

Several initiatives to be implemented include optimizing natural ventilation to reduce air-

conditioning demands and upgrading of air-conditioning units to more energy efficient ones

in our office and dental clinics.


Training and Education

21

Training and Education is important in our business to ensure continuous development of our

employees and to provide quality service to the patients. We are committed in upholding the

standards of our dental professionals. At Aoxin Q &amp; M, new employees will undergo pre-job

training after induction. In addition, all our new hires undergo a mandatory probation period

during which their skills and experience are assessed. During this period, our new hires are

also given on-the-job training and are made to shadow another experienced employee to

familiarise themselves with the Group’s operations.

Subsequent to the probation period, dental professionals and staff who are retained are

provided with regular and continuous training and development. Our training programs

include training internally, bringing in experts externally and expatriation.

Training and Education

22

Dental Professionals

We pride ourselves in having the resources

to prepare several training programs to

ensure the continued employability of our

dental

professionals.

In

providing

a

comprehensive suite of dental services,

our

dental

centres

provide

diverse

exposure and experience through career

advancement

training

and

specialized

training

opportunities

in

different

departments. Besides basic trainings and

teaching classes, we often encourage our

dental professionals to share on academic

platforms to exchange ideas. Our staff also

attend courses and postgraduate training

by specialized institutions (China Medical

University, Jinzhou Medical University, etc).

The dental professionals (i.e. dentists and

nurses) make up 80% of the Group’s

employees,

and

they

receive

regular

performance

and

career

development

review. We will ensure our dentists and

nurses meet the mandatory requirement

under the Shenyang Medical Association

and Health Bureau Act that all junior

practicing dentists or nurse shall pursue a

minimum

of

8

hours

of

continuing

professional education per year and for

senior dentist or nurses shall pursue a

minimum of 5 hours of continuing

professional education per year in order to

renew their practicing certificate.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2018

Our goals for the following years will be to

ensure that our employees receive quality

training and not solely rely on the training

hours provided as a benchmark. In Aoxin Q

&amp; M, we respect and acknowledge the

strengths

and

contribution

of

every

employee. We will also review the training

hours required for each respective role to

ensure highly qualified staff at all levels.

Occupational Health and Safety

23

Our dentists and nurses take on the role of

direct service providers, and as such, their

well-being is one of our primary concerns.

In our line of work, dentists and nurses are

exposed to several health hazards and it is

our responsibility as employers to mitigate

such risks.

Physical Well-being

Infectious hazards are the easiest to

distinguish;

needles

and

other

sharp

objects, spatter and aerosols can transmit

viral infections which are life-threatening

such

as

acquired

immunodeficiency

syndrome

and

hepatitis

B.

Bacterial

infections are also a concern. At Aoxin Q &amp;

M, we strongly emphasize on proper

disposal of used needles. For every patient,

a tray with a set of items will be used. It

includes gloves, needles and apparatus.

After each session, the set of items will be

properly disposed and replaced with a new

set. Other examples of health hazards

include exposure to x-ray radiation - which

we rely on trainings and posters to remind

our employees on safety measures. We are

subject to inspection from government

officials to ensure we adhere to the

country’s safety standards.

Mental Well-being

We also explore ways in which we can

maintain the mental well-being of our

employees. We ensure that dentists have a

reasonable time to rest after completing

the treatment of patients, and to ensure

that the quality of patients is guaranteed.

In addition, we strictly adhere to local

legislations

on

working

hours

of

a

maximum of 8 hours a day; the total

working hours do not exceed 40 hours in a

week.

Every new dentist will be assigned to an

experienced dentist to conduct on-the-job

training. An experienced dentist is not only

trained in dental technology, but also

needs to guide young dentists in other

areas, which includes, among others, the

sitting

position

of

dentists

and

communication with patients. We strive to

reduce the stress levels of our dentists

while not compromising on the service that

we provide.

Privacy

Besides physical and mental well-being, we

recognize privacy to be fundamental to

human rights. The protection of patients'

privacy is an industry consensus, and at

Aoxin Q &amp; M, we take a firm stance in

safeguarding

the

confidentiality

of

personal information. Our IT systems also

have adequate controls in place to restrict

access

to

such

sensitive

information.

Examples includes the computers being

connected internally and our dentists can

only view the information of patients that

they have attended to.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2018

We have a clean record on workplace
