Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of NauticAWT Limited (the “Company” and together with our 

subsidiaries the “Group”) reaffirm our commitment to sustainability with the publication of our sustainability 

report (“Report”). For this Report, we provide insights into the way we do business, while highlighting our 

environmental, social, governance (“ESG”) factors and economic performance. 

 

Whilst mindful of our profit-oriented objective, we are committed to strike a balance between growth, profit, 

governance, environment, the development of our people and well-being of our communities to secure the 

long term future of our Group. In line with our commitment, the Board having considered sustainability 

issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined the material ESG factors and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

 

A sustainability policy (“SR Policy”) covering our sustainability strategies, reporting structure, materiality 

assessment and processes in identifying and monitoring material ESG factors has been established and 

serves as a point of reference in the conduct of our sustainability reporting. Under this SR Policy, we will 

continue to monitor, review and update our material ESG factors from time to time, taking into account the 

feedback that we receive from our engagement with our stakeholders, organisational and external 

developments. 

 

 

2. 

Reporting Framework 

 

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option and published in 

pursuant to 711(A) and 711(B) of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). We have chosen to report using GRI Standards: Core option as it 

is an internationally recognised reporting framework. 

 

As part of our continual efforts to align our sustainability reporting with relevant market standards, we have 

mapped our sustainability efforts to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United 

Nations Member States in 2015 (“UN Sustainability Agenda”). The UN Sustainability Agenda provides a 

shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart 

are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), which form an urgent call for action by all countries 

- developed and developing - in a global partnership. We have incorporated the SDGs, where appropriate, 

as a supporting framework to shape and guide our sustainability strategy. 

 

 

3. 

Reporting Period and Scope 

 

This Report is applicable for our financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2019 (“FY2019” or “reporting 

period”). A sustainability report will be published annually in accordance with our SR Policy.  

 

This Report focuses on our renewables segment1, which will be the focus of our Group going forward. This 

business segment contributed approximately 47% (FY2018: 35%) of the Group’s total revenue for FY2019. 

We plan to widen the coverage of our sustainability reporting in the future.

Policy, Practice and Performance Reporting 

 

6.1 

Reporting Structure 

 

Our sustainability strategy is developed and directed by the senior management in consultation with the 

Board. Our senior management executives, led by our Chief Executive Officer, are tasked to develop the 

sustainability strategy, review our material impacts, consider stakeholder priorities and set goals and 

targets, as well as collect, verify, monitor and report performance data for this Report. 

 

6.2 

Sustainability Reporting Processes 

 

Under our SR policy, the sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant 

factors are then prioritised as material factors which are then validated. The end results of this process are 

a list of material factors disclosed in this Report. Processes involved are as shown in the diagram below:

6.3 

Materiality Assessment 

 

Under our SR Policy, each sustainability factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions 

required as illustrated in the table below: 

Reporting 

priority 

Description 

Criteria 

 

I 

 

High 

Factors with high reporting priority are reported on in detail. 

II 

Medium 

Factors with medium reporting priority are considered for inclusion in 

the Report. They may not be included in this Report if not material. 

III 

 

Low 

Factors with low reporting priority may be reported to fulfil regulatory 

or other reporting requirements. They are not included in this Report 

if not material.  

 

The reporting priority is supported by a material factor matrix which considers the level of concern to 

external stakeholders and potential impact on business.   

 

6.4 

Performance Tracking and Reporting 

 

We track the progress of our material sustainability factors by identifying the relevant data points and 

measuring them. In addition, performance targets that are aligned with our strategy will be set to ensure 

that we maintain the right course in our journey towards sustainability. We consistently seek to enhance 

our performance-monitoring processes and improve our data capture systems.

7.1 

Customer Satisfaction   

 

We are committed to provide value to our customers through the provision of environmentally friendly and 

quality products that meet their requirements. 

 

We are principally involved in the provision of UHPC materials to supply our customers that operate mainly 

in the port, off-shore, energy and mining and renewable energy industries. UHPC is more environmentally 

friendly when compared to conventional concrete as it possesses higher strength and ductility which allow 

for the construction of more material-efficient structures.  

 

Our key initiatives in delivering quality and environmentally friendly products to our customers are as follows: 

▪ 

Our products are certified or verified with leading market certifications on product quality such as CE 

Marking, Ü-sign or DNV. 

▪ 

Our manufacturing facility and processes are certified under the DNV, ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 

and OHSAS 18001:2007 standards. 

▪ 

A robust quality control team is maintained to conduct stringent checks on product quality based on a 

set of standard operating procedures established. 

▪ 

We have an ongoing research and development program with Enterprise Singapore to develop new 

products and enhance the quality of the existing products.  

 

As at 31 December 2019, 2 (FY2018: 2) of our key products are certified or verified with CE Marking, Ü-

sign or DNV whilst our manufacturing facility and processes are certified under the relevant DNV Offshore 

certification and ISO standards.

7.2 

Energy and Water Conservation  

 

We are committed to responsible usage of energy and water resources that helps to preserve the 

environment in which we operate in. As a Group, we operate from various office locations and an 

automated production facility in Malaysia. The facility is currently producing UHPC materials to supply 

our customers mainly in the oil and gas and renewable energy industries. Key statistics on energy and 

water consumption by the production facility during the reporting period are as follows:

Usage 

Consumption 

FY20192 

FY2018

125,793kWh 

143,042kWh 

Water 

Used for cleaning machineries and 

equipment 

764m3 

2,576m3 

 

The Group recorded higher-than-normal water consumption in FY2018 due largely to a leakage in the 

underground piping at one of our operating premises. Meanwhile, the decrease in electricity and water 

consumption can also be attributed to following conservation measures adopted by the Group:  

▪ 

A systematic maintenance program for operating equipment is in place to maintain energy and water 

efficiency. 

▪ 

Energy and water consumption are regularly tracked and analysed. Corrective actions are taken when 

unusual consumption patterns are observed. 

 

 

 

2 Estimated figures due to limited access to the source documents kept at our operating premises due to movement 

restriction measures implemented during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

7.3 

Equality and Diversity in the Workplace 

 

We are committed to diversity and equal opportunity in 

employment to grow human capital. Accordingly, we strive to 

provide a work environment for employees that fosters fairness, 

equity and respect for social and cultural diversity, regardless 

of their gender, age or educational background. The total 

number of employees in the Group as at 31 December 2019 

stood at 49 (FY2018: 77). This decrease is mainly due to 

manpower rightsizing measures implemented to lower costs 

and achieve profitability. 

 

During the reporting period, there are no significant changes in 

workforce diversity data with details as follows: 

▪ 

On gender diversity, the percentage of female to total 

permanent employees as at 31 December 2019 is 22% 

(FY2018: 25%).  Given the nature of industry which 

involves offshore operation and manufacturing activities 

and as such, the gender ratio is geared towards male 

employees. 

▪ 

On age diversity, matured workers are valued for their 

experience knowledge and skills. As at 31 December 

2019, 37% (FY2018: 40%) of our workforce is at least 40 years old.  

 

To promote equal opportunity, we have implemented various human resource measures as follows: 

▪ 

Staff assessment is performed annually and upon probation for new staff to evaluate their performance 

and provides them with a sense of self-awareness on their work performance and also to identify 

training opportunities that will improve their skills and abilities. 

▪ 

Staff recruitment advertisements do not state age, race, gender or religion preferences as requirement. 

▪ 

Employment terms in the employment letter are explained to staff when they join the Group. 

Target for FY2019 

Performance in FY2019 

Target for FY2020 

Move 

towards 

a 

more 

balanced gender and age 

ratios 

No material changes in diversity ratios 

between FY2019 and FY2018 

Maintain existing gender and 

age diversity ratios 

 

7.4 

Employee Retention 

 

The continual success of our business relies on a team of 

professional, skilled and experienced staff and managers. 

Accordingly, we are committed to employee retention through 

the following efforts: 

▪ 

Employee are engaged regularly via various channels such 

as the appraisal exercise which allows employees to gain 

feedback on their career progress.  

▪ 

In-house and external training courses are organised 

regularly for employees to improve their professional skills. 

 

We believe that a low turnover improves the sustainability of operations and allows us to contribute 

positively to the development of social and human capital in a wider community. As at 31 December 2019, 

63% (FY2018: 58%) of our employees have 3 or more years of services with us.

7.5 

Safe Working Environment 

 

In our daily operations, our workers have to handle various machineries in manufacturing our products. 

Such machineries involve processes such as handling of operating equipment such as forklifts which 

expose our employees to risk of injuries or fatalities.  Accordingly, we are committed to maintain a safety-

conscious culture amongst our employees and a safe operating environment to minimise such risks. 

 

The measures implemented to manage health and safety in our operating environment are as follows:  

▪ 

A set of safety rules and regulations is in place. 

▪ 

A safety committee is in place and safety inspections are performed regularly by safety officers and 

reported to senior managers.  

▪ 

All new employees are briefed on safety procedures during orientation. 

▪ 

Regularly track and monitor accidents at the workplace and corrective action plans are established to 

prevent recurrences of the accidents. 

 

We recorded zero incident of workplace fatality (FY2018: zero incident) during the reporting period and one 

(FY2018: zero incident) non-fatal workplace injury3, resulting in 30 man-days (FY2018: zero man-day) lost 

during the reporting period. The non-fatal workplace injury related to a hand injury. Lessons from the non-

fatal workplace injuries are shared across business units to prevent recurrence.
