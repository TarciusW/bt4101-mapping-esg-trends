BOARD

STATEMENT





02

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED









The Board of EnGro Corporation Limited (“EnGro”, or “the 

Company” and together with its subsidiaries “the Group”) 

affirms that it provides strategic direction to the Group 

and specifically considers sustainability issues as part of 

its strategic formulation.

The Board also acknowledges its responsibility for the 

Group’s sustainability reporting and believes that the 

following report provides a reasonable and transparent 

presentation of the Group’s strategy and Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”) Performance.

Scope of This Report(102-46, 102-49, 102-50, 102-51, 102-52)

EnGro is pleased to present its second Sustainability 

Report (the “Report”), which discusses the developments 

and progress of our sustainability journey in the year 

2018. The Report references the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”): Core Option issued by the Global 

Sustainability Standards Board, and is guided by the SGX-

ST Sustainability Reporting Guide (Practice Note 7.6).

In preparing the Report, we continue to focus on 

communicating value creation through our ESG strategies. 

The Report covers the ESG performance of business 

divisions and subsidiaries of EnGro in Singapore 

and Malaysia over the reporting period. Information 

is extracted from primary internal records to ensure 

accuracy and presented using internationally accepted 

measurement units.

Reporting Process(102-53, 102-54)

The Board has assigned the responsibility for monitoring 

and overseeing the Company’s sustainability efforts to 

the Sustainability Committee (the “Committee”). The 

Committee comprises senior executives from major 

functions who provide the direction for reporting. It 

reviews, assesses and determines the sustainability 

context, material topics, scope, boundary, and 

prioritisation of issues included in the Report. It considers 

formal and informal feedback from both internal and 

external stakeholders throughout the year to determine 

the material issues in the Report. The Committee is 

supported by a cross-functional team that gathers and 

verifies the data.


CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE 

ON SUSTAINABILITY



SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

03









EnGro took its first steps to go green nearly two decades 

ago with the intent to promote Ground Granulated 

Blastfurnace Slag (“GGBS”), a low carbon yet high 

performance material that could partially displace Ordinary 

Portland Cement (“OPC”), which had a high carbon 

footprint of almost 20 times that of GGBS. 

By raising environmental awareness among our 

stakeholders, the steel players and the cement players, 

it opened doors to grow our GGBS business in China. 

Our green actions started to bear fruits shortly after we 

submitted our products to be certified with eco-labels 

promoted by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) 

and the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) since 

2007. Subsequently, in year 2008 we were the first 

among our peers to adopt carbon footprint assessment 

for our products, and provide third party assessed carbon 

footprint certificates to our customers for the products 

they procure from us.

PROGRESS AFTER THE PARIS 

AGREEMENT

The Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 set the 

tone for more countries and businesses to step up to 

the call of mitigating reliance on fossil-fuel based energy 

growth to stop the damaging effects of global warming. 

The 196 nations that signed the Paris Agreement in 

2015 are stepping up efforts to tackle climate change. 

Researchers correlate changes in global temperature 

with economic performance. On 2 May 2019, the U.S. 

House of Representatives passed its first climate-change 

bill in a decade, voting 231-190 to require that Trump 

administration keep the US as a party to the Paris Climate 

Agreement. This sends a positive signal to the rest of the 

world that the largest economy of the world recognises 

the seriousness of the climate crisis and its political 

system is committed to play its role to mitigate further 

damage to the environment.

SUSTAINABILITY IS AN 

INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF 

OUR BUSINESS

Concrete, the most widely used man-made material, 

generates eight percent of global carbon dioxide 

emissions. Cement, the primary component of concrete, 

is the major source of emissions related to concrete. 

Researchers continue to conjure innovative solutions such 

as carbon capture or carbon sequestration programs to 

address the reliance on high carbon intensity materials 

such as the OPC. In recent years, while cement 

production capacity continued to grow unabatedly driven 

by rapid urbanisation and population growth across the 

world, the cement industry has also increased the use of 

Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) such as 

GGBS and Pulverised Fly Ash (PFA) to reduce its reliance 

on clinker-based OPC which still dominates the larger 

volume of cementitious materials used in construction. 

Over the past one and a half decade, green building 

certifications, such as the US LEED, Singapore BCA 

Green Mark, and China Three Star, gained prominence 

across the world. These green building certification 

standards recognise the value-add of GGBS and Green 

Cement to reduce the embodied carbon of concrete 

supplied to green developments. This trend is aligned 

with global consensus to reduce over-reliance on fossil 

fuel and products with large carbon footprint. Steel, 

cement and concrete, contribute nearly 70 percent of the 

embodied carbon in buildings across the world. And this 

is where EnGro could contribute, by promoting greater 

adoption of low carbon GGBS. Our 10.8 million tons 

of GGBS produced annually in China and South Korea, 

provides a significant carbon reduction in the construction 

sector. 

As a leading promoter and producer of green building 

materials – GGBS and Green Cement - efforts to strive 

towards low carbon footprint for our materials is reflected 

in our corporate tagline, Building Sustainability. 

Low carbon impact to the environment means that 

our manufacturing presence would not detriment the 

environment and the adjacent community where we 

operate in. The Group’s green initiatives continues to 

accentuate our drive in upholding the Environmental, 

Social and Governance criteria. 

Our core values of Harmony, Trust, Excellence and 

Win-win help strengthen our focus and resolve in 

continuing to make the environment clean and safe for 

our future generations. 

The Group’s GGBS and Green Cement are distinguished 

with independent eco-label certifications and carbon 

footprint certificates to help consumers identify and adopt 

truly green materials. 

Apart from existing applications that our green materials 

address, various programs are on-going to develop new 

applications for a multitude of projects in the region, 

and align with the advent of recycling economy across 

the region. These efforts call for careful planning and 

commitment to soldier on in spite of anticipated hurdles. 

Team EnGro has the perseverance and unbeaten spirit to 

develop innovation projects to fruition. 

This is our second Sustainability Report and we are 

pleased to share that we have also included our subsidiary 

unit in Malaysia in our sustainability reporting. In future 

reporting, we will continue to update the progress of the 

Group’s efforts in promoting sustainability. As the various 

stakeholders attain greater awareness of the impact of 

climate change, we believe in a collective effort with 

the community in going green and going the extra mile, 

while upholding corporate governance practices towards 

achieving a balance between people, planet, and profit.

Investments

EnGro was incorporated on 27 November 1973 under the name SsangYong Cement (S) Pte Ltd. It was originally 

formed as a joint venture between SsangYong Cement Industrial Co Ltd of South Korea, Afro-Asia Shipping Co (Pte) 

Ltd and The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. The Company was converted into a public limited company on 31 

May 1983 and assumed the name SsangYong Cement (S) Ltd.

In 1976, the Company started off with manufacturing OPC but from 2003 onwards, it ceased to produce OPC but 

expanded its product offering to include high performance blended cement, Ready-Mix Concrete (“RMC”), low carbon 

GGBS, microfine cement and other innovative construction materials.

In 2002, the Company marked the beginning of a new chapter as it witnessed the end of the Singapore-Korea 

partnership over the Company’s 30-year history. Afro-Asia International Enterprises Pte Ltd acquired shares divested 

by SsangYong Cement Industrial Co Ltd and subsequently made a mandatory cash offer for shares not owned by 

Afro-Asia International Enterprises Pte Ltd or parties acting in concert.

In 2005, the Company changed its name to EnGro Corporation Limited with a new logo that reflects its vision of growth 

in North Asia and growth through strategic partnerships. The striking blue and orange curves symbolises EnGro and 

its partners. The curve design of the logo simulates the hemisphere of a globe reflecting EnGro’s determination to 

expand globally.

Over the years, EnGro diversified its business by investing in specialty polymer, high-tech venture capital funds, property 

developments as well as food and beverage. At present, the main businesses of the Group are:

The “Building Sustainability” corporate tagline reflects EnGro’s commitment towards promoting green and achieving 

the triple bottom-line equilibrium of PEOPLE, PLANET, and PROFIT.

WHAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS TO ENGRO

buildings. The building and construction industry is a 

labour-intensive industry while the sector is also one of 

the key GDP contributors to the country. Therefore, one 

of the ways to reduce emissions from the sector while 

maintaining growth of the industry is through the greater 

use of green or sustainable materials.

As we continue to be among the leading suppliers of 

building materials in Singapore and realise our vision to be 

the integral partner of innovative and sustainable material 

solutions, EnGro has the responsibility to promote the 

use of environmentally-friendly materials. In the long 

run, we aim to increase the use of recycled materials in 

our products and commit to doing more research and 

development of innovative sustainable building materials, 

leveraging on our success in handling blastfurnance slag 

from iron producing steel mills.

EnGro also continues to provide a safe working 

environment for its employees and contractors. Safety 

is paramount in EnGro’s operations and we have put in 

place policies and initiatives to ensure minimal injuries 

occur in our operations. On these fronts, we are proud 

that we have achieved internal targets for 2018.

The global community’s commitment to limit global 

warming to 2ºC between now and 2100, requires global 

greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions to decrease by 

40 percent to 70 percent by 2050 and achieve net 

zero emissions by the end of the century. As such, 

many countries have committed towards reducing their 

GHG footprints. As part of the contribution to achieving 

this goal, the Singapore government has pledged to 

reduce its emissions intensity by 36 percent from 2005 

levels by 2030. In addition, in early 2017, the Singapore 

government announced its intention to implement the 

carbon taxation scheme beginning 2019. Meanwhile, 

China has eight pilot carbon market schemes and is 

expected to start its national carbon market in year 2020 

to further curb its emissions level on a national scale.

These recent developments clearly justify EnGro’s early 

focus and attention on sustainability. The building and 

construction sector is the second largest contributor of 

GHG emissions as building materials generate significant 

amount of embodied GHG emissions throughout their 

product life cycle due to the substantial amount of 

embodied GHG emissions contributed by the use of 

steel and concrete as the core building elements of

SUPPLY CHAIN

Supply chain forms an important aspect of EnGro’s operations. The Company relies on logistics companies to ship raw 

materials from other countries into Singapore. In Singapore, raw materials are received at EnGro’s Pulau Damar Laut 

bulk terminal and blended into our blended cement products. These products are then transported to our concrete 

batching plants to produce concrete or sold to customers directly while a small volume is sold in bagged form through 

distributors.

In Malaysia, TMM produces RMC with raw materials sourced locally and sold directly to customers. Separately, our 

specialty polymer operation unit, RPT purchases raw material from oil refiners and other suppliers from overseas to 

manufacture and supply to customers outside China.

In our facilities, EnGro primarily utilises its own employees to run the operations. Logistics service providers are 

employed to transport our products to and from Company sites. The latter’s workforce forms around 20 percent of 

our manpower in Singapore. In order to be selected as EnGro’s service providers or suppliers, potential suppliers must 

adhere to the requirements prescribed in EnGro’s Supplier Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct governs suppliers’ 

compliance to various national rules and regulations including on fair labour practices. Suppliers of EnGro are also 

subjected to regular performance appraisal or supplier assessment to ensure compliance to the Code of Conduct. In 

the future, EnGro is considering to carry out supplier audit as the next step towards ensuring compliance to the Code 

of Conduct.

MAPPING OF MATERIAL ISSUES TO GRI

Following materiality assessment, the material issues identified were subsequently mapped to the GRI Topics. The 

mapping of the material issues to GRI Topics are based on the definition of each issue as agreed among the Core 

Group of EnGro’s representatives participating in the materiality assessment.

Following the identification of material issues and mapping to the GRI Topics, EnGro started to conjure processes to 

gather information required by the GRI Standards. Although this is our second Report, we may not have a complete 

set of information required for full disclosure in accordance to the GRI Standards as we are still streamlining the internal 

information gathering process. Nonetheless, we are committed to providing complete and accurate disclosures and 

we are working towards enhancing the quality of our disclosures in subsequent Reports.

GOVERNANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO SUSTAINABILITY

EnGro upholds the highest standard in governance and ethical conduct. We comply with the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 as required by the listing rules of the Singapore Exchange. Please refer to page 24 of the FY2018 

Annual Report for the details of EnGro’s Corporate Governance.

In addition, in light of the SGX listing rule 711(B) on sustainability reporting, EnGro has established a sustainability 

reporting team, which reports directly to the Committee. The Committee consists of representatives from various 

departments of the corporate headquarters. Under the guidance of the Board, the Committee is responsible to integrate 

sustainability principles and policies throughout the business in the coming years.

Healthy economic or financial performance is paramount 

for EnGro’s foundation as a key pillar to support the 

Company’s efforts in other aspects of sustainability. The 

Company recorded a profit before tax of S$7.0 million in 

year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”).

EnGro recorded a revenue of S$144.3 million for FY2018, 

a 1.8 per cent increase compared to the S$141.8 million 

in FY2017, due to higher revenue from Integral Cement 

and RMC segment, offset by a 27.7 per cent drop in 

Specialty Polymer revenue.

The Group reported a higher profit after tax of S$6.0 

million compared to S$3.8 million for FY2017, attributed 

to better performance from Integral Cement and RMC 

segment, a one-off gain from divestment of a subsidiary 

in China and lower foreign currency exchange loss.

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

The majority of EnGro’s workforce is full-time employees 

under our payroll. We rely on logistics service providers 

to transport our products to and from our facilities, which 

make up approximately 20 percent of our total workforce 

in Singapore. Ensuring that each employee and worker 

are treated fairly is important to EnGro to promote welfare 

and talent retention.

EnGro is fully compliant with the Singapore government’s 

employee practices listed under the Ministry of Manpower. 

The Human Resources team at EnGro formulated the 

Human Resource Policies and Procedures which are 

applied to EnGro’s business units in Singapore and 

Malaysia. This ensures consistency of internal practices 

among business units so that EnGro can remain 

competitive by being aligned with industry norms. The 

document communicates grievance procedures, dictates 

employee benefits, reminders on work-life balance, and 

freedom to collective bargaining, and governs our hiring 

and promotion policies, which are reliant on merit-based.

Employees have access to anonymous whistle blowing 

avenues if they find our practices, including remuneration 

to be suspect according to legal and industry standards. 

EnGro’s whistle blowing policy is designed for employees 

raising concerns without fear of reprisal, to an internal 

authority (Chairman of Audit Committee, CEO and the 

Internal Auditor). Employees can choose to voice their 

grievance to their supervisors or anonymously through 

an electronic mail box of the Company. The policy makes 

a commitment to protect the reporter, address issues 

raised and keep the reporter updated on the progress of 

the resolution. The policy is reviewed annually to ensure 

effectiveness and relevance to the dynamic environment.

As demonstration of our commitment towards providing 

transparent and merit-based compensation package, we 

disclose the remunerations of our directors and our top 

five key management personnel in page 42 of our FY2018 

Annual Report.

In order to ensure employees and contractors receive 

proper labour and social protection as entitled by the 

law, before confirming employment of individuals, EnGro 

conducts verification of workers’ legal status. The 

Company also carries out verification of work pass and 

daily roll-call during Toolbox Meeting to ensure workers

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

EnGro places significant emphasis on the health and 

safety of its employees. Management ensures that 

the Company complies with legal requirements for all 

safety and health matters and educate our employees 

to observe safety requirements at all times. Since 2012, 

EnGro’s operations in Singapore have obtained OHSAS 

18001 certification for Occupational Health and Safety 

Management Systems.

At EnGro’s production facility, employees attend toolbox 

meeting on a daily basis, where safety advisories and 

reminders are communicated to employees. Before 

commencing any work, supervisors or project managers 

must complete a hazard analysis/risk assessment of 

the work activities and submit to the appropriate EnGro 

management for approval. This requirement is applicable 

to both EnGro’s employees as well as its contractors.

All accidents, would have to go through the process 

of reporting and follow-up until proper closure of each 

accident case. All accident cases have to be reported 

to the supervisors and plant manager and investigations 

are carried out to ensure corrective actions have been 

identified and implemented.

We aim to maintain a “Zero Accident” record at all sites. 

In order to achieve this target, EnGro has taken the 

following initiatives:

1. 

Employ a Safety Officer to educate and identify safety 

gaps and work towards closing all occupational 

health and safety gaps.

2. 

Develop Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”) 

manual and display the SOP explicitly at all sites with 

safety rules embedded in all the work processes to 

ensure that safety rules are strictly and consistently 

observed.

3. 

Organise regular in-house safety training and have 

safety instruction diagrams available visibly near or 

on starting equipment in both English and Chinese.

4. 

Provide external safety training to supervisors to 

upgrade their skills and to keep abreast of latest 

safety rules and procedures.

EnGro recorded zero case of injuries, lost-time injuries 

and fatality during the reporting year of 2018.

COMPLIANCE

EnGro upholds a relentless commitment towards 

corporate governance which is in accordance with our 

continuing obligation as a company listed on the SGX. 

We are committed to go beyond the basics in regulatory 

compliance and have established a robust internal 

system, governed by the board and senior management, 

that diligently cross-checks our compliance to regulations 

in various countries that we operate in.

EnGro’s goal is to ensure that Management maintains a 

sound system of risk management and internal controls 

to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the Company’s 

assets. We have set up a risk assessment structure in 

the form of an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) 

Committee comprising the key Heads of Departments. 

The ERM Committee convenes every three months to 

discuss the key risk areas that affects the Group’s 

business. The ERM committee submits its findings to the 

AC Chairman and the Board of Directors for review and 

comments on a quarterly basis.

By adhering to laws, regulations, guidelines and 

specifications relevant to EnGro’s businesses, it ensures 

that the Group’s long-standing reputation is intact and 

continues to be preserved. In our view, a strong and 

ethical reputation forms an integral element of our core 

values of “Harmony, Trust, Excellence, and Win-Win”, 

which enhance our ability to attract strong partners 

to expand our various businesses and attract relevant 

personnel to join our ever-growing capable workforce.

EnGro recorded zero non-compliance case against the 

Company in 2018.

Staying true to our vision, EnGro has run its business with 

responsibility to the environment. We implemented green 

initiatives more than a decade ago and today we are seeing 

the results of our efforts. In 2010, EnGro contributed to 

the establishment of Friends of Building Sustainability, an 

independent cross-industry platform for peers to exchange 

information on green practices. EnGro and its subsidiary 

companies have invariably sought to obtain international 

certifications, such as the ISO, to demonstrate our 

environmental commitment. Our Singapore operations were 

certified ISO14001 since 2012 and we aim to attain ISO 

certification for our Malaysia concrete operation.

To communicate the results of our green initiatives, EnGro 

chose to implement carbon footprint assessments at 

product and company level to communicate the GHG 

contribution of our operations and products to our 

stakeholders. In 2011, EnGro engaged the services of a 

professional GHG assessor to analyse the product Life 

Cycle Assessment (LCA) of its products in accordance 

to international standards ISO14040/44 and PAS2050. In 

2012, we were early adopters of the ISO14064 to assess 

the GHG emissions relating to organisational emissions. 

EnGro is also proud to have achieved carbon neutrality 

for China joint venture laboratory building project in 2013 

as per PAS2060 certification by offsetting our carbon 

emissions.

These assessments have enabled EnGro to better 

understand the true emission sources of our products 

and our operations, which have helped us to manage our 

resources more efficiently. Management truly believes in 

the benefits of monitoring EnGro’s GHG footprint and 

continues to assess its emissions.

USE OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS

highest industry standards for a green product. Our products 

also eventually received the “4 ticks” or “Leader” rating from 

the Singapore Green Building Product (“SGBP”) accreditation 

body. This rating is given to eco-friendly products with low-

carbon content. High-rated SGBP products can accrue more 

points in the Singapore BCA Green Mark rating system, with 

the 4 ticks Leader products scoring 1 additional point per 

qualifying product.

EnGro’s products utilise recycled materials as raw materials. 

Moreover, EnGro cement and Top-Mix Concrete use EnGro’s 

low-carbon VCEM product to their mixtures. This results in 

products of lower carbon-content than typical OPC, while 

maintaining the strength and functionality of the products. 

Since 2007, EnGro’s low carbon products have received 

accreditation from the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme 

for its sustainability qualities. In addition, since 2011, our 

products have also been acknowledged to have met the
