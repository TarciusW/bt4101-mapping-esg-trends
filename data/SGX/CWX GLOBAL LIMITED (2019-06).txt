BOARD STATEMENT 

The board of directors of CWX Global Limited (“CWX Global” or the “Company”, and together 

with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to present the 2019 Sustainability Report (the 

“Report”) for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 (“FY2019”).  

The Report covers the Group's two core business segments, namely (i) investments and trading-

related activities under CWX Investments Pte. Ltd. (“CWX Investments”), a wholly-owned 

subsidiary of the Company, and FIT Global Pte. Ltd. (“FIT Global”), a strategic joint venture of 

the Company; and (ii) oil and gas business under Loyz Oil Thailand Pte. Ltd. (“Loyz Thailand”), 

a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which is the holder of a 20% stake in three oil-

producing onshore concessions – SW1, L44/43, and L33/43s located in the Phetchabun Basin, 

Thailand (the “Concessions”). CWX Global’s primary income flow is from the sale of oil extracted 

from the Concessions.  

The Group takes effective corporate governance close to heart at all levels to ensure sound 

business decisions are made. Corporate governance also ensures business operations are 

carried out properly and with a proper monitoring feedback system to enhance future decisions. 

As responsible corporate citizens, we consider sustainability issues from the perspective of our 

own business growth. We will grow our sustainability approach in the medium and long-term to 

bring in more Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors to measure sustainability 

and ethical impact of our key investments under CWX Investments and Loyz Thailand. 

This Report is set out on a “comply or explain” basis in accordance with Rule 711B and Practice 

Note 7F on “Sustainability Reporting Guide” of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”). It is based on 

the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards (2016) (“Core” option) which provides a 

framework for the reporting of economic, environmental and social impact. In this Report, we have 

also described our commitments, governance, policies, performance and targets in relation in 

managing the sustainability risks and opportunities during FY2019. 

This Report is done in good faith and to the best of our knowledge. No external assurance was 

sought for this Report.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Report Scope 

While the Company has a number of subsidiaries, this Report will focus only on CWX Investments 

and Loyz Thailand (collectively, the “Companies”), which are the two key subsidiaries of the 

Company undertaking the Group’s two core business segments, as described above.  

 

Materiality Assessment 

The Report uses a targeted approach to identify ESG factors which are of high importance to our 

stakeholders and essential for the Companies. Our materiality approach is closely guided by our 

core values of shareholders’ value and long-term sustainability of the business. The criteria were 

determined through an internal survey of managerial staff and compiled into this Report. 

The Companies adhere to the GRI Standards’ principle on materiality and have adopted a three-

step approach to identify, prioritise and validate various ESG factors which are significant to both 

the businesses and stakeholders of the Group. 

 

Stakeholder Engagement 

The Companies currently have a variety of ways in which we engage with our stakeholders. Going 

forward, we will reach out more extensively to our stakeholders to obtain feedback on how we 

can advance our sustainability initiatives.

Material Factors 

For purpose of this Report, the Companies conducted an internal review and had determined the 

following key material factors: 

 

Diagram 1: Material Factors 

 

Management Approach 

Here at CWX Global, we value integrity, professionalism, enterprise, mutual respect and expect 

all our staff to adhere to these principles and strictly adhere to laws and regulations wherever we 

operate in the world. 

While the Company is an investment company first and foremost, we are acutely aware of the 

environmental impact of the industries we invest in and through our shareholding and participation 

in meetings where we impart our values of professionalism and adherence to all laws and 

especially environmental regulations in relation to our oil and gas business.

Diagram 2: CWX Global Business Method 

 

As mentioned in the Board Statement, the Group operates principally in two core business 

segments, namely (i) investments and trading-related activities under CWX Investments and FIT 

Global; and (ii) oil and gas business under Loyz Thailand, which is primarily held through its 20% 

stake in the Concessions. As the Group is a minority stakeholder, the Group is thus reliant upon 

the operator and holder of a 60% stake in the Concessions (namely ECO Orient (as defined 

herein)) for all technical reporting and sustainability efforts. 

 

Investments and Trading-Related Activities 

CWX Investments (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) and FIT Global (the Group’s 

strategic joint venture with Apostar Pte Ltd (formerly known as Arctos Investments Pte Ltd)) 

currently undertake the Group’s investments and trading-related activities. CWX Investments 

focuses on secured lending and investment, while FIT Global is principally in the business of (i) 

investments, including private equity deals, pre-initial public offerings (mature stage), initial public 

offerings, fixed income and hybrid instruments; and (ii) trading, including the trading of equities, 

commodities and other financial instruments. FIT Global is led by a team of investment banking 

veterans, deal makers and professional traders.

Oil and Gas Business  

Loyz Thailand (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) holds a 20% participating interest in 

three producing Concessions – SW1, L44/43, and L33/43, a strategic joint operation located in 

the Phetchabun Basin, Thailand, which currently generates a steady income stream from its 

existing oil producing wells.  

Loyz Thailand’s partners in the Concessions are ECO Orient Energy (Thailand) Ltd, ECO Orient 

Resources (Thailand) Ltd and the Berlanga Group (together with Loyz Thailand, collectively 

known as the “Joint Operation”). The Concessions are currently operated by both ECO Orient 

Energy (Thailand) Ltd and ECO Orient Resources Thailand Limited. ECO Orient Energy 

(Thailand) Limited and ECO Orient Resources Thailand Limited (collectively known as “ECO 

Orient”) are wholly-owned subsidiaries of ECO Environmental Investments Limited, which is a 

Hong Kong based energy company which focuses on the investment and management of a 

portfolio of new energy projects including energy infrastructure, chemical plants, oil and gas 

resources as well as research and development. 

The Group seeks business diversification to reduce reliance on the Concessions by diversifying 

its revenue stream, as well as improving future prospects and better support the growth of the 

Group, in order to enhance shareholders’ value for the Group.

Financial Assistance Received from the Government 

The Companies benefit from the Singapore government Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) in FY2019. 

First introduced in the 2013 budget, the Singapore government co-funded 40% of wage increases 

from 2013 to 2015. In 2015, the WCS programme was extended with co-funding at 20% from 

2016 to 2018, 15% in 2019 and falling to 10% in 2020. This benefit is paid directly to the employer 

and only for Singaporean employees with a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. 

 

Markets Served 

Investments and Trading-Related Activities 

CWX Investments is a Singapore-based investment company with key investments in Singapore 

with a focus on the Hong Kong market. 

 

Oil and Gas Business 

The Joint Operation sells all of its produced oil to a single customer in Thailand.

ECONOMIC 

Investments and Trading-Related Activities 

With CWX Investments operating its own team of professionals and through FIT Global, the Group 

offers a holistic suite of investment and trading services which are accessible to institutional and 

accredited investors. 

 

Oil and Gas Business 

The Group’s key asset is its 20% stake in the Thailand onshore oil Concessions located in the 

Phetchabun Basin, which currently generates a steady income stream from its existing oil 

producing wells.  

The production license for the SW1 Concession was renewed for another 10 years from July 2016, 

while production licenses for the L44/43 and L33/43 Concessions are due to expire in 2032. 

Currently, there are thirteen production licenses covering an area of 134.65 square kilometers 

under these Concessions. 

The Joint Operation will continue to harness the potential of the Concessions which have proven 

reserves for production within the untapped areas of the Concession.  This asset holds substantial 

proven reserves for development as well as significant potential for further exploration, promising 

value enhancement and sustainable long-term growth. 

The Joint Operation intends to roll out the planned drilling campaign progressively to expand oil 

production capacity.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

CWX Group is acutely aware of the environmental impact on business operations. However, the 

days of dirty polluting oil extraction are long gone and through our influence in our subsidiaries’ 

operations, we ensure that our environmental impact is minimized, health and safety standards 

are upheld and that all current laws are adhered to fully. In particular, we have stood firm and 

required that the Group meets at a bare minimum the following in all its operations: 

• 

Conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) prior to commencement of any 

development activity. 

• 

Assess energy efficiency at every level of operations, with the objective of minimizing 

energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases. 

• 

Ensure tracking, monitoring and reviewing of our environmental impact. 

• 

Implement a strict asset maintenance regime to eliminate spills and other contamination. 

• 

Educate and train our staff and subcontractors on our environmental policy and goals. 

• 

Meet or exceed the required environmental or regulatory legislation during our operational 

and development activities. 

• 

Implement office recycling, repurposing and upcycling especially usage of office paper 

printing. 

• 

Support creative design concepts for our development activities that utilize alternative 

fuels, reduce flaring and minimize facility size. 

• 

Minimise carbon footprint by reducing electricity usage when no one is in the office. 

When it comes to seismic and extraction operations, the Joint Operation has a strict corporate 

policy to reduce risks to as low as practicable and will closely monitor our environmental targets 

both against legal limits and internal targets going forward.

Managing Exploration, Appraisal and Development Well Operations 

The following summarizes the activities undertaken by the Joint Operation in connection with 

exploration and appraisal drilling operations: 

• 

well design and planning; 

• 

prepare drilling facilities and worksite; 

• 

well construction and handover (or abandonment); 

• 

management of well equipment and materials; 

• 

selection and management of contractors; 

• 

logistics management; and 

• 

environmental and waste management. 

 

Water 

The Joint Operation has a wastewater management plan that complies with all local laws and 

regulations. Each type of waste is segregated according to the Department of Mineral Fuel 

(“DMF”), Ministry of Energy’s waste codes and management protocol. The quantity of each type 

of waste is carefully logged in the waste manifest system before being transported and treated by 

registered waste transporters and waste disposers respectively. 

Drilling cutting waste, which is non-hazardous, will be sent to the landfill to comply with the waste 

management plan, while mud/clay drilling waste, which is hazardous, will be sent to a cement kiln 

to be used as a raw material for the construction industry. 

DMF’s waste codes and management protocol go far beyond just drilling operations with different 

codes for toxic water and various drilling muds but extends to disposal of drilling hardware, filters, 

lubricants and containers. All our waste processing is expected to meet or exceed the guidelines 

set out in the initial EIA. 

DMF’s waste codes and management protocol even extend to office waste such as different 

codes for different types of AA and AAA batteries as well as different classes of paper and 

cardboard for recycling, for instance. Office waste on site uses a septic tank in accordance with 

local regulations.  

The Joint Operation aims to continue to meet legal and regulatory requirements going forward. 


 

15 | P a g e 

 

Biodiversity 

The Joint Operation has a reforestation programme around all the well sites within the 

Concessions, upon termination of the extraction, to encourage biodiversity. 

 

Emissions 

The laws of Thailand do not require air quality to be part of the EIA report. However, the Joint 

Operation goes above and beyond these environmental regulations and have put in place a 

system to monitor the air quality in the villages and communities near the drill sites to compare 

them with a baseline before the project was started. To date, the Joint Operation has not recorded 

any deterioration in air quality attributed to the extraction operations. The Joint Operation will 

continue to monitor these environmental concerns going forward into 2020. 


16 | P a g e  

 

6. 

Occupational Health and Safety 

Health and Safety Policy 

The Joint Operation has a SMS policy in place with regular inspections and audits and have 

designated three levels of responses, with an emergency response group within each level. The 

Joint Operation has a database of personnel charged with emergency management 

responsibilities. 

An Incident Response Team (“IRT”), which is located at the drill site in Wichian Buri, is trained to 

handle all envisaged incidents and emergencies alongside a country-level Emergency Response 

Group (“ERG”) based in Bangkok, Thailand. 

The ERG conducts regular tests of both procedures and equipment to ensure that they are always 

in a state of readiness along with regular training of all personnel to ensure everyone knows how 

to respond to an emergency situation. 

The IRT is the first responder to deal with all incidents and emergencies. The ERG provides 

support, advice and off-location assistance, communicates with authorities and next-of-kin and 

coordinates specialist support and recovery.

17 | P a g e 

 

Control of Substances Hazardous to Health 

The Joint Operation is committed to eliminate, or control risks arising from the use of any 

hazardous substances that may present a health risk to employees. All such substances in use 

are carefully identified and any potential risks are evaluated. Internal controls will then be put in 

place to reduce that risk to an acceptable level. 

Although the Joint Operation provides suitable personal protective equipment (Personal 

Protective Equipment HSE-PM-004) for use by employees, this is not considered to be the 

primary control measure. Elimination or substitution with a less harmful substance is the preferred 

management option. 

The Production Assets Manager, or Project Manager, is responsible for implementing all the 

necessary precautions and controls and to ensure the product has been assessed and any 

hazards/risks evaluated. 

The Joint Operation provides all employees with an annual health check-up programme in 

accordance with the local laws of Thailand. Furthermore, all employees involved with extraction 

who may come into contact with crude oil have to undergo additional periodic checks for benzene 

exposure through monitoring of their urine samples. 

The Joint Operation has an Environmental Management System with its own Health Safety and 

Environmental policy with clear procedures on oil spills, blowouts and chemical leakages. The 

Joint Operation understands its legal and financial responsibilities to clean up any pollution arising 

from its operations. The Joint Operation has contingency plans in place, which cover everything 

from exploration, drilling to loading. 

The drill sites are designed to protect underground water but nevertheless water quality is 

carefully monitored in case of any unforeseen contamination. Samples are taken as a baseline 

before drilling and tested after drilling and also after any level 2 oil spills and are tested in areas 

near to the drilling site. Regular annual testing is also performed. All drainage effluents are 

monitored and are currently within the limits of the pollution control department standards of 

Thailand. 

Similarly, surface water is monitored for contaminants with a baseline before and after drilling, 

after any incident and annually to ensure safety. 

 


 

18 | P a g e 

 

Soil monitoring is conducted outside the boundary of the drill site, one upstream and one 

downstream and soil samples are checked for a list of pollutants at the end of the first year of 

operations and thereafter every five years. 

The Joint Operation uses non-toxic drilling fluids in its operations. Muds are stored in a polyvinyl 

chloride (PVC)-lined sump that is constructed one meter above the site to ensure that they will 

not be able to leak into groundwater or soils. 

Consideration is given to nearby residents, the closest of which is in a village two kilometers from 

the site. Trucks deliveries are minimised and limited to daylight hours. 

The majority of waste gas is re-used for heating in the separation process though a small amount 

is flared. Flaring has much less environmental and health impacts than venting of volatile 

hydrocarbons. Air quality samples are taken at regular intervals around the clock not just at the 

site but at three locations in three nearby villages. These results are carefully monitored in 

particular for traces of toxics, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, and 

are reported to the local community. To date, there have been no incidents regarding pollution 

from flaring. The site also monitors and analyses PM10 soot as a by-product of flaring. 

The Joint Operation has set procedures for the end-of-life of a well once the project is at a close. 

Wellsite abandonment involves re-injecting sump liquids into the well or solidified in a cement 

mixture, capping the well with cement and planting trees over the entire area as part of introducing 

biodiversity.

PEOPLE 

Labour Practices and Decent Work 

The Group has set up a clear non-discrimination policy and has a strict anti-slavery and no child 

labour policy which is communicated to all our subsidiaries. 

We aim to continue our policies of zero child labour and anti-slavery and pay all employees their 

contractual salaries promptly. 

 

Employment 

The Group has a fair, non-discriminatory employment policy through a formally structured 

interview procedure. The Group recognizes the importance of training our entire staff in order to 

improve standards and boost morale. As the Group operates in the oil and gas industry, specific 

Health and Safety training is carried out and strictly overseen by both public and private bodies 

and this certification extends to our contractors to ensure safety at all times. 

 

Labour/Management Relations 

Efficient communication, both up and down the organization, is essential for the Safety 

Management System (“SMS”) and other management systems to function effectively. The 

communication structure is designed not only for the passage of information but to motivate 

people through their involvement and understanding. It is recognized that well motivated 

employees contribute more towards the overall success of the Group. Regular meetings are held 

at the site, management and corporate levels to ensure operational safety as well as to motivate 

our employees.

Training and Education 

Here at CWX Global, we believe in our employees and help them reach their fullest potential. The 

Group has regular training for employees at all levels; for instance office staff are trained and kept 

up to date with the latest accounting standards, requirements of the SGX-ST and related courses 

under the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and SkillsFuture. At the end of each 

training programme, participants are asked to summarise and circulate key points learnt to the 

rest of the organization. In addition, the Group provides extensive safety training programmes to 

ensure that all staff are up to date with the latest safety procedures and new staff are made aware 

of the safety procedures in place.  We also encourage employees to further develop their skills 

by allowing for study leave. 

In FY2019, the Group conducted over 300 man-hours of training.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

In formulating employment policies, CWX Global has been guided by relevant legislations to 

establish its employees’ contracts. 

These policies are regularly reviewed and new policies are introduced following consultation with 

employees. 

CWX Global is committed to the promotion of Diversity and Equality and takes its responsibility 

to promote equality of opportunity and eliminate unlawful discrimination seriously. 

The Group’s policy is to hire and select on the basis of merit. We look to the potential employee’s

status and or disability. Our goal is to create and maintain a healthy and positive working and 

learning environment, which creates mutual respect and dignity and enables everyone to realise 

their full potential. 

The Group has a strict policy against bullying, discrimination, harassment or victimisation by or 

towards any of our employees, contractors, suppliers, stakeholders and visitors. Any such cases 

are taken seriously and may result in disciplinary or other appropriate action and, in serious cases, 

may lead to termination of contract. 

The Group has five staff in Singapore, while the Joint Operation has two hundred and sixty nine 

staff in Thailand. Please refer to Diagram 5 for the breakdown of Singapore and Thailand

GOVERNANCE  

Anti-Corruption 

CWX Global will always act honestly, openly, fairly and ethically wherever we do business. We 

are committed to preventing corruption in all its forms and do not tolerate it in the course of our 

business or in those with whom we do business with. 

We strive to uphold all laws aimed at countering corruption in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 

CWX Global has a zero tolerance approach to corruption and expects this of all staff, suppliers 

and business partners.  

Our policies encourage any employee who has any suspicion of bribery or other form of corruption 

to report the suspicion to audit committee chairman where it will be dealt with appropriately and

these criteria and formalise our data collection going forward. 

 

Enterprise Risk Management 

The Group has in place several risk management measures to manage its exposure to risks that 

are associated with the conduct of its business. Please refer to our financial statements set out in
