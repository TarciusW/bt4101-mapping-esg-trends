1. About Penguin International Limited 

Penguin International Limited (“Penguin”) is a Singapore home-grown, publicly listed designer-builder-

owner-operator of aluminium high-speed marine craft. The company was incorporated in 1976 and listed on 

SGX in 1997. 

Since 1995, we have delivered close to 200 aluminium vessels, including crewboats, patrol boats, passenger 

ferries and fireboats, to ship owners around the world, including some 120 of our proprietary-designed Flex 

offshore crewboats and security boats (“Flex Fighters”). 

Penguin is the world’s most prolific builder 1 of mid-sized, multi-role crewboats/security boats for the 

offshore and maritime security industries. In some markets, the Flex brand has become the industry standard. 

Our shipyards in Singapore and Batam operate build vessels for-stock and to-order, funded by internal cash 

reserves. Repair and conversion projects involving a variety of high-speed craft, including luxury yachts, 

firefighting search-and-rescue vessels, passenger ferries and patrol craft are also  

In addition to shipbuilding, Penguin also operates a fleet of Flex crewboats (through its wholly-owned Pelican 

group) and passenger ferries that serve a myriad of clientele in Southeast Asia and beyond, including 

ExxonMobil, Shell, Singapore Civil Defence Force and those in the oil and gas industry.  

Our vessels are well maintained and professionally manned by our in-house ship management team, backed 

by our two shipyards. We prize safety over profit and we abide by international standards on Health, Safety 

and the Environment.

4. Approach to Sustainability 

Sustainability lies at the core of Penguin. We believe that value creation should transcend the needs of the 

present and contribute to the welfare of the future. From our daily operations to our long-term strategic 

direction and business model, we adopt and implement measures which bring about sustainable changes 

for sustainable growth. Through our pragmatic management and unique capabilities as an integrated 

designer-builder-owner-operator of high-speed aluminium vessels, we take on new challenges and drive at 

innovation. Together with management and employees, we stand strong in the face of adversity, endeavour 

to stay ahead of competitors and pursue growth to deliver sustainable returns across all areas for our 

stakeholders. 

 

a. Sustainability Governance 

The Board of Directors (“The Board”) oversees our 

sustainability strategy and the management of critical 

sustainability matters. The Sustainability Committee 

comprised of our Managing Director and our Finance 

and 

Administration 

Director 

ensures 

the 

implementation of the sustainability strategy and 

evaluation of our progress against commitments. Our 

implementation of respective practices relies heavily 

on the various Department and Unit Heads. They are 

responsible for integrating sustainable practices in our 

day-to-day operations.  

Through regular discussions and updates, our 

Sustainability Committee continually assesses our 

performance and provides input where needed. 

Annually, during our Board Meeting, a review of our 

overall enterprise risk management process including 

sustainability performance, is undertaken by The Board. Sustainability topics and impacts as well as risks and 

opportunities will also be reviewed to ensure its continued relevance. For more information on overall 

Corporate Governance, please refer to page 25 to 36 of our Annual Report 2018. 

 

Board Statement 

 

The Board is pleased to present its second sustainability report prepared in accordance to SGX-ST Sustainability 

Reporting Guidelines for all listed companies in Singapore. The Board, together with the Sustainability 

Committee considers sustainability matters as part of the Group’s strategic formulation. The Board has 

approved the material ESG factors and determined them to be relevant for the current year. The Board 

oversees that these ESG matters are monitored and managed.  

 

As we progress on our sustainability journey, we urge our stakeholders to share the Group’s commitment to 

transparency to work towards a common goal of improving the economic, environmental and social well-being 

of the communities we operate in.

c. Materiality Assessment 

 

A formal materiality assessment was conducted in September 2017 to identify Penguin’s key economic 

environmental, social and governance matters. The sustainability material matters were reviewed in 2018 

and determined to be relevant for the year.  

 

FIGURE 4: FOUR-STEP MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS 

 

Facilitated by an independent sustainability 

consultant, Penguin embarked on a rigorous 

four-step materiality assessment. 

 

1. Identification of potential sustainability 

matters for Penguin through a series of 

stakeholder engagement sessions and 

desktop research; 

2. Through an anonymous electronic voting 

exercise, sustainability matters were 

prioritised which resulted in a total of nine 

sustainability matters (six material and 

three additional) for reporting; 

3. These material matters were presented to 

the Board for their validation; and 

4. Selected material matters may undergo 

review in subsequent reporting periods to 

ensure its continued relevance to 

Penguin’s operations. 

The Board approved the relevance of the existing 

nine sustainability matters. Penguin will continue 

to disclose detailed sustainability performance 

based on the nine sustainability matters

5. Product Quality Stewardship  

Penguin strives to continuously innovate in areas of ship design and building. Aside to ensuring compliance 

to highest quality standards, we make a conscientious effort to control product carbon footprint and exercise 

responsible product use and disposal upon end of life. Additionally, we engage, collaborate and work 

alongside our clients to meet and exceed their expectations. Here are two vessels we are delighted to 

showcase.  

Penguin Redeem – “Solarfication Conversion Project” 

 

 

 

 

 

Penguin Redeem is a 26-metre, 260-passenger port limit ferry that is owned and operated by the Penguin 

Group. As Singapore’s largest locally-flagged port limit ferry, Penguin Redeem plays a critical role in the mass 

transport of personnel between Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal and Shell’s 500,000-barrel per day oil refinery 

located on Pulau Bukom. On average, the ferry provides two-way transport for about 2000 passengers every 

weekday.  

Like all domestic ferries with live-aboard crew, after working hours, Penguin Redeem used to run on one 

diesel generator while alongside, with the main engines turned off. The generator had to keep running after-

hours in order to generate electricity to power the air-conditioning, lighting, as well as cooking and washing 

equipment (i.e. the “hotel load”) for the live-aboard crew of six. 

This “hotel load” requirement would typically consume about 100 litres of diesel and generate some 0.26 

tonnes of CO2 and 0.2 tonnes of SO2 overnight. It also added some 3,000 running hours per year to the 

generator, which results in more frequent overhauls, consuming more energy in the process. 

In November 2018, Penguin partnered with its technology partners, Azura Marine and Z-Power Automation 

embarked on a project – the first of its kind in Singapore - to “solarise” Penguin Redeem, with the aim of 

generating and storing sufficient solar energy during daytime operations to power the vessel overnight, 

solely from stored solar energy during the day. The “solarification” entailed converting key on-board 

electrical equipment to run on both AC and DC power, running new cables, upgrading the power distribution 

system and installing solar panels on the vessel’s roof and batteries in the hull. 

After several months of engineering work and overcoming production constraints, such as the tight 

machinery space on Penguin Redeem, the conversion works were finally completed on January 2019. The 

“solarised” Penguin Redeem commenced trial operations at Shell Bukom. The results were a resounding 

success! Today, Penguin Redeem stands as physical proof that renewable energy solutions need not be costly 

or complicated and can be implemented by companies of all sizes.

Penguin is currently exploring similar “solarfication” solutions through conversions for its own fleet and its 

newbuilding programme. 

 

Flex-42X with Green Passport Certification by Bureau Veritas  

 

 

 

 

In 2018, Penguin delivered its first crewboat with the Green Passport 

class notation. Christened “Svitzer Chittagong”, the 36-metre multi-

role crewboat was built for the global marine logistics group Svitzer 

for its offshore operations in Bangladesh. This vessel is generally 

regarded as the world’s first mid-sized crewboat with the Green 

Passport notation, which means that is accompanied with an on-

board document certified by Bureau Veritas (BV) that lists in detail 

all materials deemed potentially hazardous3 to human health and 

where they are located in the vessel.  

Close monitoring of hazardous materials which are not prohibited 

for use is done through the use of an Inventory of Hazardous 

Material, which is useful for major repairs and demolition of the 

vessel at the end of its life. People working on the vessel will know 

specifically which materials to handle with caution and where they 

are used / located on board. 

Regulation-wise, Green Passport certification are only required for EU-flagged ships above 500 gross tonnage 

(GT). Notwithstanding the fact that “Svitzer Chittagong” was way below 500 GT and was non-EU flagged (and 

also unlikely to ever call on any EU port), Penguin and Svitzer mutually agreed to voluntarily spec-out and 

build a crewboat that would fully comply with Green Passport rules. 

For Penguin, the challenging part of the Green Passport process was obtaining the “Supplier’s Declaration of 

Conformity” from all key equipment and materials suppliers involved in the shipbuilding project. There were 

instances where Penguin had to source for new vendors who were both willing and able to provide this 

legally binding declaration, in order to fully comply with the certification rules. 

 

 

3 Based on BV rule note NR528 DT R204, hazardous materials prohibited from all newbuild vessels include asbestos, ozone-depleting 

substances, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), anti-fouling compounds and systems.

Buoyed by the success of “Svitzer Chittagong”, Penguin has decided to build Green Passport crewboats under 

voluntary compliance for its own operating fleet, starting with its flagship Flex-42X Executive Fast Crew Boat. 

To date, we have delivered four units of Flex-42X with Green Passport notation, with two more under 

construction. We intend to continue building Green Passport crewboats under voluntary compliance for the 

foreseeable future, even though it entails a higher cost. 

 

6. Economic Resilience 

As a global leader in our sector, we continue to harness the numerous opportunities brought about by our 

unique and dynamic capabilities as an integrated designer-builder-owner-operator. In FY2018, we are 

delighted to have secured and executed several new orders ranging from Fire Fighting Search-and-Rescue 

vessels for Singapore, patrol boats for Australia, windfarm support vessels for Taiwan and a passenger ferry 

for Africa, while continuing to build stock Flex Fighter security boats for Nigeria and Flex crewboats for our 

own operating fleet in Southeast Asia. With an increasing number of projects, we are also building a fifth 

workshop in our Batam shipyard to provide support capabilities.  

Despite challenging situations in the oil and gas industry, resilience has always been one of our defining traits 

at Penguin. We survive and thrive in adversity as we consider them valuable lessons for the future. Prudent 

financial management has enabled our strong balance sheet and the capacity to quickly and easily capitalise 

on new project and investment opportunities. In FY2018, we continue to see further growth where group 

revenue experienced a 36.2% increase from FY2017 ($82.8 million) to $112.8 million. 

Beyond our own economic sustainability, we value the partnerships we have with our national agencies and 

local clients. Late last year, our Tuas shipyard delivered one of the two newbuild Fire Fighting Fire Fighting 

Search-and-Rescue to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Our ship management team promptly took 

over technical management of the vessel under a multi-year maintenance contract. Through this contracting 

model, it enables SCDF to focus on its core life-saving duties. 

On crewboat chartering services, we have also seen meaningful improvements in overall utilisation and 

charter rates, led by our new Flex-42X Executive Fast Crew Boat. Although our fleet of Flex-42X currently 

remains an in-house product exclusively for Pelican entities, it will eventually be rolled to third-party ship 

owners at suitable phases. In FY2018, we are pleased to have sold a Flex-40SL and converted two existing 

Flex-45 crewboats into Flex Fighters as armoured security boats for Nigerian clients.  

We also further our commitment to sustainability by maintaining healthy relationships with the communities 

in our operating countries. In Batam, for example, we regularly support and sponsor various development 

activities at a nearby fishing village. In Singapore, we have regularly contributed to non-profit organisations 

such as the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Life Community Services Society, Singapore 

Association for the Deaf and other community outreach programmes since 2014.

Case Study: Recycling of Scrap Timber at PTKS 

 

Penguin’s Batam shipyard receives many equipment and material from Singapore on a weekly basis. 

Most of this equipment and material are shipped out on wooden pallets, which would be broken up and 

sold as scrap or disposed of.  

 

In 2018, one of our subcontractors approached us with an interesting and meaningful recycling project. 

The scrap timber was proposed to be used to build goat pens for a local orphanage where he was 

volunteering at. The management unanimously expressed their support and committed to donate as 

much scrap timber as he needed.

7. Our People, Our Assets 

 

As one of the three fundamental components of our sustainability strategy, Penguin firmly believe that our 

people are our greatest assets. With an unprecedented increase of close to 600 employees (including crew) 

located across Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, we continue to ensure a culturally diverse, fair and 

inclusive workplace that nurtures and cultivates a passion for excellence, innovation and sustainable value 

creation. 

 

a. Staff Demographics 

Our workforce has maintained a steady increase over the past three years. From 425 employees in FY2017, 

we have grown 27.5% to 542 employees in FY2018. Increased shipyard activities in Singapore and Batam 

have resulted in the higher employment. Additionally, higher crewboat operations have also brought about 

an increase in Malaysian offshore crew in FY2018. Our workforce comprises employees in offices, shipyards 

and on-board crew members. Part-time/temporary staff account for 11% of our total workforce. 

While the marine and offshore industry has traditionally been male-dominated, we continue our efforts in 

ensuring a more gender-balanced workforce. We are proud to have a female Executive Director on our Board 

of Directors, and female employees in ship design and ship repair departments. A breakdown of workforce 

statistics is shown in Figure 7 below.

b. Workplace Diversity and Fairness 

 Policies and Practices 

Our commitment to TAFEP since 2014 is reaffirmed yearly by our strict adherence to the five principles of 

fair employment where hiring practices are fair, merit-based and non-discriminatory. We are able to attract 

and retain individuals with the right skillset, attitude and capability to grow through our fair employment 

practices. Our open-door policy has also given an atmosphere of openness and direct communication where 

employees are able and encouraged to raise workplace concerns to senior management if required. 

Regularly, top management communicates updates on company strategies and other information in a timely 

manner. Figure 8 showcases our Policy Statement and suite of policies we adhere to at ensuring a fair and 

diverse working environment at Penguin. This year, we are proud to disclose that we have achieved our 

target of zero reported cases of discrimination.

Case Study: Promoting life-long learning at Penguin  

In FY2018, we enrolled one employee into the inaugural Specialist Diploma in Maritime Superintendency 

course administered by Singapore Maritime Academy. Developed in alignment with the Skills Framework9 

for Sea Transport, this course is based on critical functions required of Technical and Marine 

Superintendents. Through this course, our employee will acquire a deeper understanding of the key 

functions as a Marine Superintendent and enhance our ship management operations.  

 

The selected employee is a Singaporean and has been with Penguin for more than four years. We plan to 

enrol other personnel in the second run scheduled in FY2019, further building our capabilities.

Performance Appraisals 

Our high regard for all our employees is bound by equality and respect for diversity. All employees whether 

foreign workers or office staff will be equally recognised and allocated annual bonuses, which is particularly 

unique among shipyards in Singapore. In FY2018, 100% of our employees received formal annual appraisals. 

Performance appraisal will differ depending on employment category and skillsets. Onshore staff begin the 

process with assessment by supervisors and an endorsement by the General Manager. Crew members 

working on board, on the other hand, are assessed by their Master and endorsed by the Crewing 

Officer/Manager. Offshore crew members who work on engagement basis are assessed over the contractual 

period. 

 

Performance  

In FY2018, we saw a significant increase in our activities, which required additional manpower. As such, we 

had a total of 202 new hires. Through the conscious promotion of age and gender diversity, we aim to attract 

and employ the best-qualified and most suitable candidates for any given job. We actively seek the right 

people and welcome elderly employees to join us as well. Continuing on with our strong partnership with 

Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to hire more Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PR), we 

have hired one Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) under the Career Support 

Programme in FY2018. Among the new hires, we also have two local employees who are over the age of 60 

years, recruited to mid-level positions at our shipyard and ship management operations.

This year, we had a total of 85 cessations. Crew members on Seafarers’ Agreement are employed on a one-

year contract and will leave our company after that. This is a common practice within the maritime and 

offshore industry. During this period, most of these seafarers will take this opportunity to undergo training 

to upgrade themselves and return again with their higher certification. Majority of our seafarers are 

Indonesian males who belong to the younger age group. Other common reasons cited by foreign workers is 

a desire to go home to their families. For local employees, reasons include a career change or a higher salary

8. Safety  

a. Safety on board our vessels for crew and passengers  

Policies and practices  

At Penguin, we believe that every individual has role to play 

in ensuring a safe environment for all. We go beyond 

regulatory requirements and comply with more stringent Oil 

and Gas Producer (OGP) standards10 as most of our clients 

are in the oil and gas industry. The Deputy General Manager, 

supported by Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) 

Manager oversees and enforces safe practices in vessel 

operations to protect the life and health of our passengers, 

crew, the general public and the environment. Similarly, on 

board our vessels, compliance with the Environment, Health 

and Safety (ESH) management system falls under the 

responsibility of our Masters. We remain committed 

towards our zero-incident target and strive to bring no harm 

to people, property and the environment. 

Throughout the year, various initiatives have been 

conducted to promote and communicate a no-blame safety 

culture to all our stakeholders. Beginning from risk identification, it ensures timely and complete assessment

passengers 

 

• Safety and Environment Policy 

Statement 

• Stop Work Authority Policy 

• Navigation Policy  

• Drug and Alcohol Policy Statement  

 

In FY2018, no changes have been made to 

the content of these policies. They undergo 

review annually to ensure its continued 

relevance to our operations. For more 

details of each respective policy, please 

refer to our 2017 Sustainability Report.

of the risks involved with various work activities. Control measures are implemented prior to 

commencement of work on board. Mandatory training for crew members and ad-hoc safety trainings will 

be conducted on ferries.  

 

Collaborative Efforts with Clients 

In November 2018, a Danos system was implemented for the SCDF vessels. SCDF was looking at a Planned 

Maintenance System which has a detailed, traceability function and allows for close follow up for all activities. 

Aside from keeping records of all maintenance activities, it also prepares job plans for any period. This allows 

for the Superintendent to update status of jobs or to sign off as completed. Upon this action, the system 

automatically creates a job card and mail for the intended users. Within the system, it also keeps track of 

last maintenance action, emergency job handling as well as spare usage. While it allows for a timely update 

of the vessel’s operations, it also reduces the usage of paper and space required for filing, making it an 

essential component of this vessel, given the space constraints on board.   

 

Trainings 

Conducted at least once every six months, refresher trainings would be 

provided for our crew on Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 

requirements. In July 2018, 24 ferry crew attended the refresher 

training. Besides safety, the training also included awareness session 

on heart diseases. Moving forward, we plan to conduct more personal 

health awareness sessions to cover diabetes, stress, fatigue and other 

relevant topics.  

In November 2018, Penguin Chawan was the first ferry to conduct the 

first stability calculation course which covers core concepts on vessel 

stability especially during weight transfer.  

 

 

Safety Campaigns  

On 21 May 2018, we organised our second safety campaign for all 

crew in ferries and crewboats. Crew members were tasked to identify 

the hazards that could be found in various situations over a period of 

two month. The top scorers were awarded with a prize and all other 

participants were presented with a token of appreciation.  

 







Big smiles from two of our top scorers 

upon receiving the prize 


20 

 

 

Aside from our internal safety campaigns, we work with 

clients to meet their safety requirements. Flex Fleet Sdn Bhd 

(FFSB) organised a Vessel UCUX (“You See You Action”) 

campaign which aimed at increasing safety awareness of 

crew members. A UCUX report is one where crew members 

identify unsafe acts or conditions encountered during work 

or in their surrounding workplace. A daily submission of the 

UCUX was required according to client’s requirements. 

Through this program, we hope to bring about a 

behavioural change towards safety with the importance of 

hazard identification emphasised on a daily basis. It also 

improved our crew’s understanding of various UCUX 

categories. With these submissions, our client was able to 

better enforce the same rules to their own contractors 

working on board our vessels. At the end of the five-month 

period, prizes were awarded to the best written UCUX.  

 

 

To ensure that any non-compliance and control lapses get to be identified as soon as possible, various 

reporting channels have been made available to all stakeholders (crew, operation staff, charterers and 

passengers) for them to raise their concerns. Based on the nature of the grievance, a relevant person-in-

charge will be informed for appropriate follow up actions. At the end of the year, all feedback received will 

be consolidated and presented during the annual management review to check for repeated cases.  

In FY2018, there were several cases raised through the grievance channels which were concerns regarding 

delayed logistics supply to vessels, non-compliance with reporting, PPE usage and housekeeping practices. 

We treat all reported cases seriously and work towards improving our operations. All cases have been 

followed up and resolved with the respective charterers. 

 

Evaluating effectiveness of systems, policies and actions  

Throughout the year, our vessel operations undergo regular internal and external audits to ensure 

compliance with International Safety Management (ISM) Code, International Ship and Port Facility Security 

(ISPS) Code and Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) Code. Our offices undergo annual third-party audits 

while an ISM certified vessel is audited at a 2.5 years interval. Findings would be categorised into non-

conformities and observations, escalated to respective person-in-charge for root cause analysis and 

corrective actions to be taken. Additionally, computation of safety statistics reflects the current safety levels 

within our operations. Trainings will be arranged at fixed intervals according to the weakness or needs 

identified.  

 

Performance 

Safety statistics for fleet operations are collated and reviewed every month by management and quarterly 

reports will be submitted to the Board. We keep a no-blame safety culture, target zero fatalities, zero lost 

work day cases, zero restricted work day cases and zero medical treatment cases. While we actively work 




21 

 

 

towards achieving these targets, incidents still may occur occasionally. We respond swiftly, establish root 

causes and learn from the incidents. The respective departments actively seek ways to prevent reoccurrence. 

In FY2018, we recorded two reportable incidents on board. However, as employees do not require medical 

leave for the incidents, our reportable incident severity rate (ISR) has remained at 0. We endeavour to keep 

reportable incidents to a minimum through continuous promotion of a safety culture at Penguin.

b. Safety – Occupational health and safety in our shipyards 

Policies and practices  

Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) committee comprise our 

General Manager, Safety Manager and Safety Coordinator. The 

Committee oversees the workplace health and safety 

management at our shipyards and ensures that safety policies 

practices are effectively implemented at various operation 

units; including Yard, Project, Quality Assurance (QA) and 

Engineering departments. Safety and health matters are a 

business priority to us so we strive to prevent all undesirable 

risks in our operations while upholding our commitment 

towards zero reportable incidents.  

 

 

Obtaining Certifications  

In March 2018, Penguin Shipyard International (PSI) received bizSAFE 

STAR, the highest level of bizSAFE. To achieve this certification, PSI 

had to obtain Occupational Health and Safety Management (OHSAS) 

18001 certification

14  and have a valid risk management 

implementation audit report by MOM-Approved Workplace Safety 

and Health (WSH) auditor.  

With the bizSAFE STAR status, we are able to gain a competitive edge, 

possibly bringing about more business opportunities. A safe and 

healthier work environment also results in healthier and motivated 

employees. This certification is valid until March 2021 and a renewal 

audit will be conducted thereafter to sustain this level.  

 

Enhancing safety for all  

As part of our shipyard’s efforts in 

enhancing 

our 

emergency 

response 

capability, we will be constructing a new 

First Aid Room. The newly built room will be 

equipped with basic medical emergency 

items and equipment for quick response. It 

can also be used to conduct safety induction 

trainings for new employees and visitors.  

 

 

 

14 Companies can also obtain SS506 Certification issued by Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) accredited certification bodies or any other 

equivalent international certification. 









Penguin has a suite of policies governing 

occupational health and safety in our 

shipyards  

• Harmonised

Performance 

Our reporting process of safety statistics at shipyards are in line with reporting process for vessels, following 

the same frequency. We align ourselves to the Workforce Safety and Health (Shipbuilding and Ship Repair) 

Regulations 2008. In FY2018, there were two reportable work-related incidents where employees suffered 

lacerations on different part of bodies.

9. Environment  

a. Energy Consumption Management and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 

Policies and practices 

Cognisant of the environmental impacts our operations bring about, Penguin constantly explore ways to 

“green” our processes and emphasise on responsible business conduct. We are currently developing our 

Energy Policy and more details will be provided in due course. 

Throughout our daily operations, energy consumption is strictly monitored. Our vessels run on fuel and its 

consumption is recorded and tracked daily through a fuel consumption report. Should there be any 

anomalies, they will be raised immediately for further inspection. Additionally, our Planned Maintenance 

System will be carried out regularly to ensure engines are performing at optimal efficiency.  

On the innovation front, we have successfully delivered our first solarised Penguin Redeem in FY2018. 

Through installation of solar panels and other conversion work, the Penguin Redeem is able to generate and 

store sufficient energy to power the vessel overnight. We are delighted to share that design team is looking 

to replicate this design to other existing and newbuild vessels. Well-positioned with our unique capabilities 

as designer, builder, owner and operator, we look towards promoting alternative-fuelled vessels in the local 

market and abroad.  

 

 Performance – Shipyards 

The main energy consumed in our shipyards are from fuel and electricity purchased from the grid. Across 

our Tuas and Batam shipyards, diesel, lubricant (lube oil) and waste oil are the top three fuels used for the 

operation of heavy machinery, fork lifts and motor vehicles. In FY2018, we record a 21% increase in total fuel 

and electrical energy consumed at our shipyards stood at 11,963 GJ (Figure 17), translating to 1,606 tonnes 

of CO2 emissions (Figure 19).  

The main increase in energy consumption (Figure 16) was attribute to a large increase of projects in FY2018. 

By comparing the energy intensity based on manhours worked, we are at 11.9 GJ per 1,000 man hours 

worked, an increase from FY2017. However, when compared against vessels under construction, we have 

lowered energy consumed per vessel by 78% from FY2016. As we see an increase in the number of projects 

undertaken, Penguin endeavours to maintain or further lower energy used per vessel.  


25 

 

 

FIGURE 16: FUEL AND ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION – SHIPYARDS 

 

 

FIGURE 17: TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND INTENSITY – SHIPYARDS  

 

 

When comparing GHG emissions emitted from FY2018’s production levels, a higher energy consumption 

would naturally result in a higher emission level. Due to energy-efficient processes, we also see the same 

trend in GHG emissions emitted per vessel under construction. Moving forward, we will strive to maintain 

this trend and reduce our carbon footprint.

Performance – Vessel Operations 

Vessel consumption for the past three years have been restated to account for all crewboat and ferry 

operations in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. All our vessels only consume Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) as 

its main source of energy on board. In FY2018, a total of 1,052,099 GJ20 of MDO was consumed, translating 

to 78,328 tonnes of CO2 emissions21. 

Across the years, we can see an increasing trend with FY2018 recording the highest consumption due to 

peak in utilisation rate as well as an increase in our fleet size. Through the implementation of various energy-

efficient technologies, we have consumed 11.7% less fuel and emitted less GHG emissions per running hour 

in FY2018. 

We will continue to monitor fuel consumption on board through daily fuel consumption reports. The flow 

meter on board is maintained regularly so that any irregularities in consumption will be flagged out promptly. 

Optimal engine performance is also ensured through planned maintenance schedules.  

 

FIGURE 20: TOTAL FUEL CONSUMPTION AND GHG EMISSIONS AND INTENSITIES – VESSELS 

 

b. Vessel Emissions 

Since FY2017, Penguin has committed to Emission Control Area (“ECA”)22 Standard on sulphur limit in fuel 

oils. We only use ultra-low sulphur content MDO which is 0.005% and below. Penguin has achieved this 

 

 

20 Net calorific value used to calculate direct energy consumption from fuel is 42,700 kJ/kg, obtained from Amendments to the 2014 Guidelines 

on the Method of Calculation of the Attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for New Ships (Resolution MEPC. 245(66), as amended by 

Resolution MEPC. 263(68). 

21 As extracted from European Commission: Quantification of emissions from ships associated with ship movements between ports in the 

European Community, emission factor of MDO is 3179 kg/tonne fuel. 

22 The ECA established include the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean Sea area of which 

Penguin’s vessels do not cross into these areas. Marine Fuel Sulphur Limit under MARPOL Annex VI states that sulphur content of any fuel oil 

used on board outside an Emission Control Area (ECA) is to be reduced from 3.5% in 2012 to 0.50% on and after 1 January 2020.

10. Corporate Governance 

Regulatory Compliance 

Compliance Management Operating System  

Our commitment to sustainability begins from maintaining compliance with all legal and other requirements 

applicable to our activities, and products and services. These requirements include the relevant Primary 

Legislative Status (Acts) passed by the Parliament, the Subsidiary Legislations (Regulations, Notifications and 

Orders) issued by the relevant governmental agencies, and the applicable Singapore Standards and Codes of 

Practice. We also comply with the relevant industrial standards and codes. Policies and procedures are in 

place to guide the implementation.  

At present, each function within our organisation is responsible for monitoring and reporting compliance 

matters relevant to their own function. Information gathered on legal and other requirements are cascaded 

in a timely manner to the respective functions, as well as our business partners like suppliers and 

subcontractors. 

Case Study: Adoption of MPA’s recommendation on enhanced lifesaving appliances  

 

In June 2018, we voluntarily took up MPA’s recommendation 

on the enhanced lifesaving appliances for new Penguin 

Redeem. The vessel’s buckle-type lifejackets were previously 

placed in two pieces in a holding net under each seat. It was 

easily accessible but may be prone to dislodging which may 

pose as a potential tripping hazard. We replaced the buckle-

type lifejackets to foldable buckle-type so that they are easily 

stored in life-jacket receptacles under each seat.

Study 2014. The report is accessible at:

Performance 

This year, we achieved our perpetual target of zero cases of regulatory non-compliance.  

 

Business Ethics  

Fundamental Standard  

We remain steadfast in upholding ethics in our business practices and target towards zero lapses of the Code 

of Corporate Governance 2012. Penguin’s robust business ethics framework and anti-corruption policies 

(Figure 22) provides guidance on expected conduct and practices to prevent any possible improprieties25. All 

employees of Penguin including full-time, part-time and contract employees are encouraged to immediately 

report, without fear of retaliation, any concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial 

reporting or other relevant matters. Complaints can be raised through our whistle-blowing channel. Our 

whistle blowing policy is found on our website.

* Conflict of Interest Policy is applicable for purchasing department on all purchasing decisions 

 

Performance 

Since FY2016, we are proud to have maintained our record of zero reported cases of anti-corruption for the 

third consecutive year. Penguin maintains its zero-tolerance position against all forms of corruption or 

financial improprieties and clearly communicates this to all employees. It is emphasised when our employees 

sign their letter of appointment and further reinforced during mandatory orientation upon their 

commencement. In FY2018, 100% of employees have been communicated on anti-corruption policies and 

procedures.  

 

 

25 Possible Improprieties refers to any activity, breach of business conduct and ethics or omission by an Employee of the Group; or any concerns 

regarding accounting or auditing matters, internal controls or internal accounting controls and other operational matters that are questionable 

or not in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices or trade practices prescribed by the Group
