Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company” or 

“HAC” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) 

firmly believes that high standards of corporate 

governance and sustainable business strategy are 

the core pillars that determine the Group’s success in 

creating long–term value for its stakeholders and to 

thrive in the post–pandemic environment. 

While the global COVID–19 situation remains fluid 

due to the� emergence of new coronavirus variants, 

communities and business worldwide have gradually 

adjusted to living with the pandemic that marks more 

than two (2) years of its presence. The Group has 

achieved a high level of business resilience through its 

robust corporate governance framework which focuses 

on eﬀ ective leadership and oversight; transparency 

and accountability; inclusive and sustainable 

development; as well as continuous risk management, 

mitigation and control. 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) will continue 

to steer recovery or thriving trajectories and further 

strengthen resilience to possible future shocks by 

focusing on driving sustainable business growth, 

business model innovation and embrace the key tenets 

of good governance. 

The Group’s eﬀ orts in upholding the highest standards 

of corporate governance have been acknowledged 

by the Singapore Exchange Regulation Pte. Ltd. 

(“SGX RegCo”), with the Company be included in and 

remained on the SGX Fast Track since 2019. Under 

this programme, the Company will enjoy prioritised 

clearance on selected corporate action submissions 

to SGX RegCo. Recognition from the SGX RegCo 

is a testament to the Company’s good corporate 

governance standing and compliance track record. 

The Company’s ongoing efforts to enforce best 

practices in corporate governance, as well as the 

practices implemented in all aspects of the Group’s 

operations throughout the financial year ended 

31 December 2021 (“FY2021”) are highlighted in 

this report and the Board Committee reports (the 

“Committee Reports”), as well as the sustainability 

report embedded in and form part of the Company’s 

annual report for FY2021 (the “Annual Report”). All the 

following Committee Reports form part of this report:

Compliance with the Code of Corporate 

Governance

The Company has applied the principles of the Code 

of Corporate Governance 2018 (the “Code”) to its 

corporate governance structure and practices as 

described in this report and the Board is pleased to 

report that the Group has adhered to all material 

principles and provisions of the Code, and wherever 

applicable, the disclosure guide developed by the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX–ST”) in January 2015, together with other 

applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the

BOARD MATTERS 

The Board’s Conduct of Aﬀ airs

The Company is committed to upholding the highest 

ethical and corporate governance standards. It 

conducts business with integrity, fairness and 

transparency and will not tolerate any acts, attempted 

acts, or assistance with any form of bribery or 

corruption whether direct or indirect. 

The Board continues to focus on value creation, 

innovation, sustainability and ethical business 

practices, and has embedded them in setting the 

strategic directions of the Company. It has put in place 

a code of conduct and ethics, sets appropriate tone–

from–the–top and desired organisational culture, and 

ensures proper accountability within the Company. 

With these good corporate governance practices, the 

Company has been able to react swiftly to manage and 

control the transitionary risks that are evolving at pace 

under the uncertain business environment brought 

upon by the COVID–19 pandemic.

Duties of the Board. The principal functions of the 

Board are to:

(a) 

establish corporate values and ethical standards 

of conduct for the Group;

(b) 

oversee the business performance and aﬀ airs 

of the Group and provide entrepreneurial 

leadership;

(c) 

set strategic direction for the Group, maintain 

the policy and decision–making framework in 

which the strategy is implemented;

(d) 

establish 

and 

maintain 

a 

sound 

risk 

management framework and adequate internal 

controls, setting risk appetite to achieve an 

appropriate balance between risk and the 

Group’s performance;

(e) 

supervise, monitor and review the function and 

performance of the Group’s management and 

ensure that necessary resources are in place for 

the Company to meet its strategic objectives;

(f) 

review and approve annual budgets, ﬁ nancial 

plans, major acquisitions and divestment plans, 

funding and investment proposals;

(g) 

ensure transparency and accountability to key 

stakeholder groups including compliance with 

relevant laws and regulations as well as the 

ﬁ nancial reporting standards;

(h) 

ascertain and ensure the environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) factors that are most 

material to the Company’s long–term goal and 

viability are integrated into its overall business 

strategy;

(i) 

review sustainability risks and ensure the 

management of the material ESG factors is 

incorporated in the Company’s enterprise risk 

management process;

(j) 

review and approve the appointment of 

Directors and key management personnel 

(“KMP”); and

(k) 

instil an ethical corporate culture and promote 

sustainable development.

Conﬂ ict of Interest. Directors have a duty to act in the 

best interests of the Company and are required to take 

all reasonable steps to avoid situations in which their 

own personal or business interests directly or indirectly 

conﬂ ict, or appear to conﬂ ict, with the interests of the 

Company. The Policy on Director’s Conﬂ icts of Interest 

which was established in 2019, complements the 

Company’s corporate governance practices, and serves 

to guide the Directors in recognising and handling 

conﬂ ict situations. This policy requires any member of 

the Board or Board Committees who has an interest 

in a matter being deliberated upon by the Directors 

to recuse himself from discussions and abstain from 

participating in the approval process involving the 

issue of conflict. The Directors are also obliged to 

comply with disclosures obligations to avoid any 

possible conﬂ icts of interest.

Board Access to Information. The Board has 

unrestricted access to the Company’s records and 

information. Directors are furnished with complete, 

adequate and timely information, and they are 

promptly alerted of changes to the Group’s business 

and ﬁ nancial condition, to assist the Board to make 

a balanced and informed assessment to decide 

on matters as and when they arise. The CEO and 

the senior management of the Group (collectively, 

the “Management”) have been maintaining close 

coordination and open dialogue with the Board on 

both the business risks and the workplace health 

and safety issues posed by COVID–19, including the 

employee vaccination progress, to ensure the Directors 

are fully cognisant of the decisions and actions of the 

Management.

Documents and adequate information relating to 

meeting agenda items, including background and 

explanatory notes, financial statements, budgets, 

forecasts and progress reports of the Group’s business 

operations and internal audit reports are circulated 

at least one week prior to each Board and/or Board 

Committee meeting through the digital board portal, to 

allow suﬃ  cient time for Directors to comprehensively 

understand the issues to be deliberated upon and 

make informed decisions thereon. Senior management 

personnel who can provide additional insights into the 

matters at hand, if required, will be invited to attend 

the meetings to present business performance and 

address queries from the Directors.

Analysis report covering the Group’s operational 

performance, ﬁ nancial results, market environment, 

treasury 

activities, 

corporate 

and 

business 

development as well as other relevant information 

is presented to the Board on a monthly basis. Such 

regular updates and timely reports allow the Board 

to monitor the Group’s performance as well as 

Management’s performance relating to the goals and 

objectives set by the Board. All information requested 

by the Director is provided in a timely manner.

Directors have direct and independent access to 

Management and may, at any time, request for further 

explanation, brieﬁ ngs or informal discussions on any 

aspect regarding the Group that is required for the 

discharge of Directors’ duties and responsibilities. The 

Directors also have separate and independent access 

to the Company Secretary at all times. The Company 

Secretary advises the Board on corporate and 

administrative matters, facilitates Director’s orientation 

and professional development, and ensures timely and 

good information ﬂ ow within the Board and Board 

Committees, and between Management and the 

Independent Directors. The Company Secretary and/or 

her colleague attends all Board and Board Committees 

meetings to ensure that Board procedures are 

followed and that the applicable rules and regulations 

are complied with. The appointment and removal of 

the Company Secretary are subject to the approval of 

the Board as a whole.

In furtherance of their duties, the Directors, individually 

or collectively, may also seek independent legal and 

other professional advice concerning any aspect of the 

Group’s operations or undertakings, at the Company’s 

expense.

Delegation of Authority. The Board embraces 

the principle of empowerment, and believes that 

governance and management are more effective 

and eﬃ  cient when they are separated. The day–to–

day management, operation and administration of 

the Group, including the implementation of the ESG 

strategy, are led by the Management team, whose 

are accountable to the Board for their performance 

in pursuing the long–term success of the Group. 

The Management collaborates closely with the non–

executive Directors and provide insights on the Group’s 

operations.

While the Board Committees and Management 

are tasked with certain responsibilities, all major 

decision–making remains the ultimate responsibility 

of the Board as a whole. A written Policy on Board 

Delegation of Authority (the “Delegation Policy”) which 

sets out the framework and mechanisms by which the 

Board delegates speciﬁ c standing powers and limits 

of authority to speciﬁ ed positions, has been adopted 

since 2017. The Delegation Policy aims to balance 

the need to empower and devolve decision–making 

to appropriate levels for operational efficiency and 

to ensure proper systems of control are in place. It 

provides clear directions to Management on matters 

that are reserved for the Board’s decision and 

approval, which include the followings:

(a) 

overall Group business and budget strategies;

(b) 

capital 

expenditures, 

investments 

or 

divestments exceeding certain material 

thresholds;

(c) 

all capital–related matters including capital 

issuance and redemption;

(d) 

signiﬁ cant policies governing the operations of 

the Company;

(e) 

corporate 

strategic 

development 

and 

restructuring;

(f) 

material interested person transactions which 

fall within the meaning of the Listing Manual; 

and

(g) 

risk management strategies.

All material transactions are reserved for the Board’s 

decision as a whole, without any individual or group of 

individuals exercising any considerable concentration 

of power or inﬂ uence, or being allowed to dominate 

the Board’s decision making.

In times of heightened uncertainty, it is vital that the 

Management with a global vision of Group’s operation 

has the capacity and authority to make timely and 

agile decisions. Delegation of crisis response to the 

Management has facilitated the Company’s ability to 

quickly adopt the measures required or restrictions 

relating to COVID–19 pandemic which are imposed 

by the governing bodies in the countries where it 

operates.

Board Meetings. The Board meets on a quarterly 

basis and as warranted by particular circumstances. 

Four (4) meetings were scheduled and held in 

FY2021 to review, discuss and receive updates from 

Management on the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance, 

annual budget, sustainability issues, corporate 

strategy, business plans, potential corporate actions, 

capital plans, risk management policies, appointment 

and re–appointment of Directors, executive 

remuneration, significant operational matters and 

development of corporate actions that took place 

during the year.

The Board believes that meetings between 

Independent Directors who have no relationship 

(whether familial, business, ﬁ nancial, employment, or 

otherwise) with the Company encourage and promote 

greater openness and facilitate provision of well–

balanced viewpoints to the Board. Lead Independent 

Director may summon a meeting without the presence 

of the non–independent directors and Management 

whenever deemed fit. Any recommendations or 

suggestions arising from such meeting will be 

communicated to the Board or to the Management as 

appropriate.

The Chairman oversees the setting of Board meeting 

agendas, and the Directors are encouraged to propose 

any topic that is deemed appropriate to be discussed. 

Draft meeting agendas are circulated to the chairmen 

of the Board and Board Committees in advance for 

comments, to make sure that all material topics are 

attended to.

To ensure meetings are held with maximum 

participation of the Directors, all Board meetings are 

planned and scheduled in advance after consultation 

with Directors. In addition, Directors who are not 

able to be physically present in the Board meetings 

may participate in the Board and Board Committee 

meetings by telephone or video conference, as 

permitted under the Company’s Constitution (the 

“Constitution”). The Constitution also provides that 

the Board may make decisions and grant approval by 

way of written resolutions. A list of written resolutions 

approved by the Board and Board Committees is 

compiled and circulated during Board and Board 

Committee meetings.

Social distancing measures and travel restrictions 

to curb the spread of coronavirus have made 

virtual Board meeting a necessity. As the Board has 

employed board portal technologies since 2014, it is 

technologically equipped to have virtual meetings. All 

the Company’s Board and Board Committee meetings 

held since the onset of the COVID–19 pandemic were 

conducted remotely via electronic means, and all 

meetings materials continued to be disseminated 

through the encrypted, secured board portal. The 

switch from the regular physical meetings to virtual 

ones does not aﬀ ect the eﬀ ectiveness of the Board 

process and all meeting materials continued to be 

readily accessible in a timely manner on Directors’ 

tablet devices, laptops or desktop computers. The 

digital board portal enhances effectiveness in the 

boardroom and is especially important to facilitate 

information flow to and amongst Board members 

during this pandemic.

The record of Directors’ attendance at the Board and Board Committee meetings as well as at general meeting in 

FY2021 is set out below:

BOARD GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK AND LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 

The Company’s corporate governance framework is designed to ensure that the Board has the authority and 

practices in place to review and evaluate the Group’s business operations and to make decisions independent 

of Management. In making determinations about the corporate leadership, the Board considers many factors, 

including the speciﬁ c needs of the business and the best interests of the Company’s stakeholders. The current 

leadership structure is comprised of a Chairman, a CEO, a Lead Independent Director, and Board Committees led 

primarily by Independent Directors. The Board believes that this structure provides an eﬀ ective balance between 

strong leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent directors.

Board Committees. The Board oversees the Company’s corporate governance practices, in part, through the 

work carried out by its four (4) Board Committees, namely, the AC, NC, RC and StratCom. Delegating certain 

functions and authority of the Board to the Board Committees enhances the governance framework, enables to 

Board to discharge its oversight function more eﬀ ectively, and allows the Board capitalises on and beneﬁ ts from 

the expertise of the Independent Directors. 

Each Board Committee functions within clearly deﬁ ned terms of reference (“TOR”) which have been approved by 

the Board. The TOR, committee structure and membership of each committee are reviewed by the Board from 

time to time.

Except for the chairman of StratCom who is not an independent director, all other Board Committees are led by 

an Independent Director, to encourage independent oversight and enable the Board to discharge its obligations 

more eﬀ ectively. 

The primary responsibilities of each of the Board Committees together with their current membership are set 

forth below, with the detailed functions and involvement of the key Board Committees described in the respective 

Committee Reports.

Mr Nisbet has sat on the Board for a continuous period of nine (9) years since 7 January 2013 and was 

re–appointed to the Board as an Independent Director in the 2021 AGM through the two–tiers voting process. He 

has however, expressed his intention to retire at the 2022 AGM and will not be seeking re–election as a Director 

of the Company. Consequently, Mr Lam Chun Kai will be appointed as the Lead Independent Director in Mr 

Nisbet’s place, eﬀ ective from the conclusion of the 2022 AGM.

Board Leadership Structure. There is a clear division 

of responsibilities between the leadership of the 

Board and the executive responsible for managing 

the Company’s business. The roles of Chairman and 

the post of CEO are held by separate persons, to 

ensure an appropriate checks and balances, increased 

accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for 

independent decision making where no one individual 

has unfettered powers of decision–making. The two (2) 

key roles have fundamentally disparate responsibilities 

and functions, but complement each other in the 

overall objective of creating value for Shareholders, 

and play vital roles in providing the Group with strong 

leadership and vision. Additionally, the Board has also 

appointed a Lead Independent Director to strengthen 

director independence� and ensure there is an 

independent counter–balance in light of the Chairman 

is not an independent. 

The roles, duties and responsibilities of the Chairman, 

CEO, Lead Independent Director and Directors 

of different classes (executive, non–executive 

and independent director) are detailed under a 

Memorandum on Director’s Duties and Responsibilities 

which has been distributed to each Director upon his 

appointment, and accessible in the board portal.

Board Composition and Performance 

Evaluation 

The Company’s Board is effective, comprises 

professionals with a broad range of experience 

and industry expertise, who discharge their duties 

and responsibilities at all times as ﬁ duciaries in the 

interests of the Company. 

The NC assists the Board in fulfilling its corporate 

governance responsibility with respect to board 

eﬀ ectiveness. NC determines and evaluates the size, 

structure, composition, requisite skills, performance 

of the Board and Board Committees, as well as 

the appointment, independence, development 

and competencies of its Directors. The NC makes 

and reviews recommendations to the Board on all 

nominations for appointments and re–appointments 

to the Board as well as the appointment of KMP. The 

NC functions within clearly written TOR approved by 

the Board and its principal activities are set out in the 

Nominating Committee Report.

Board Appointment and Membership. The Board 

regularly and continually reviews its structure, size and 

composition to identify the balance of skills, knowledge 

and experience required for the Board to discharge 

its responsibilities eﬀ ectively. The Board has a formal 

and transparent process for the appointment and re–

appointment of Directors. The search, nomination and 

evaluation process is delegated to the NC.

In line with the provisions under the updated Diversity 

Policy (as defined below) and to document the 

Company’s formal processes for the appointment and 

re–appointment of Directors, the Board has formulated 

and adopted a Policy on Board Nomination (the 

“Nomination Policy”) which sets out a non–exhaustive 

list of criteria with due regard for the benefits of 

diversity as set out in the Diversity Policy, for the NC 

to assess suitability of a proposed appointment and 

re–appointment of Directors. The Nomination Policy 

aims to enhance Board diversity while maintaining an 

appropriate balance between continuity of experience 

and Board refreshment. 

To ensure the Company has the opportunity to 

benefit from all available talent, the evaluation of 

potential new director is based on meritocracy and 

made in accordance with the Nomination Policy. 

The Nomination Policy provides that potential board 

candidate(s) will be considered against objective 

criteria, having due regard for the Diversity Objectives 

(as defined below), the ability of prospective 

candidates to contribute to discussions, deliberations 

and activities of the Board as well as the balance of 

independent directors on the Board. The NC also has 

a formal and written guide to conduct due diligence 

checks to assess the suitability of a candidate for 

appointment as a Director of the Company.

In its review of proposal for appointment or re–

appointment of each Director as well as KMP, NC 

will also take into consideration the composition and 

progressive renewal of the Board, as well as each 

Director’s competencies, principal commitment, 

contribution and performance (including attendance to 

the meeting, preparedness, participation and candour), 

including, if applicable, his or her performance as 

an independent director. Such appointment or re–

appointment which has been recommended by the 

NC will be deliberated by the Board as a whole, and 

the appointment are reserved for the Board’s decision. 

The Constitution also spells out the procedures for 

the appointment of new Directors, along with the re–

election and removal of Directors.

Board Composition. Upon the recommendation 

of the NC to appoint a new independent director 

with legal expertise to enhance heterogeneity in the 

boardroom, the Company’s board size has increased 

from eight (8) members to nine (9) members in FY2021, 

with a majority of the Directors are independent 

from management and business relationships with 

the Company. The Board presently consists a non–

executive non–independent Chairman, one (1) 

executive director, ﬁ ve (5) independent directors and 

two (2) non–executive non–independent directors. All 

disclosures relating to the appointment and departure 

of Directors in FY2021 have been announced to the 

public through SGXNet, in a timely manner. 

Rotation and Re–election of Directors. At each AGM, 

Directors constitutes not less than one–third of the 

Board are required to retire from oﬃ  ce by rotation, 

and a Director shall submit himself for re–nomination 

and re–election at regular intervals of at least once 

every three (3) years. These requirements are clearly 

stated in the Company’s Constitution and each 

member of the Board has submitted himself for re–

nomination and re–appointment at least once, during 

the past three (3) years.

At the recommendation of the NC and with the 

approval of the Board, resolutions for the re–

appointment of Mr Huang Xuhua, Mr Liu Jiannan, Mr 

Liu Hongsheng (“Chairman Liu”) and Mr Qin Jinke as 

Directors of the Company will be tabled at the 2022 

AGM for Shareholders’ approval. They will, upon re–

appointment as Directors, hold the same oﬃ  ce in the 

Board and Board Committees immediately held before 

their re–appointment. Each of the Directors who is 

subject to re–election at the forthcoming AGM has 

abstained himself from making any recommendation 

and/or participating in any deliberation in respect of 

the assessment of his own re–election as the Directors.

For information required under Rule 720(6) and 

Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual in respect of the 

Directors seeking re–election at the AGM, please refer 

to pages 98 to 106 of this Annual Report.

Board Diversity. The Company views diversity at 

the Board level as an essential element to build an 

open, inclusive and collaborative boardroom culture 

to support its strategic objectives and sustainable 

development. The Policy on Board Diversity (the 

“Diversity Policy”) adopted by the Company since 

2019 endorses the principle that diverse Board should 

include and make good use of diﬀ erences between the 

Directors in terms of professional experience, skills, 

knowledge, length of service, discipline, cultural and 

educational background, gender, age, ethnicity and 

other relevant factors including distinctions between 

directors such as cognitive and personal strengths 

(the “Diversity Objectives”). Diﬀ erent social constructs 

and diversity in thoughts allow the Board to consider 

issues more holistically and creatively during periods 

of uncertainty, which is important given the various 

emerging trends and business disruptions that 

may come up from time to time, such as COVID–19 

pandemic.

The inaugural report of a study developed and led by 

National University of Singapore Business School’s 

Centre for Governance and Sustainability issued 

in March 2022 confirmed the positive relationship 

between board gender diversity and company 

performance, and it shows that the companies with 

higher gender diversity, age diversity and education 

diversity among leadership have higher return on 

assets. The Board recognised that gender as one of 

the key elements of diversity can widen the depth and 

breadth of its collective skills and perspectives and it 

has intentionally included female candidates in the 

search for board candidate. Where the candidates 

for appointment as director are relatively equivalent 

in their levels of required skills and experience, the 

Board is committed to advancing female candidates, 

in order to achieve gender diversity and add a broader 

perspective on the Board. Skill sets and competencies 

have been the dominant factors that drive the Board’s 

decision for candidate to join the Board in the most 

recent appointment. 

The Company remains committed to promote gender diversity in the boardroom and to further improve the 

quality of its disclosures through policy development, representation, and transparency. Aligned with the 

regulator’s eﬀ ort to working towards increasing the representation of female on boards, the Board has recently 

reviewed and updated its Diversity Policy to explicitly address gender diversity and places emphasis on core 

diversity characteristic/targets to ensure the Board’s Diversity Objectives are met. The target, timeline and 

progress towards achieving the Diversity Objectives are summarised below:

Core Diversity Characteristic

advancing female candidates where the 

candidates for appointment as director 

are relatively equivalent in their levels of 

required skills and experience

 Average age of Board should be less 

than the prevailing retirement age in 

Singapore, preferably represented by 

at least three (3) diﬀ erent age groups

Board Independence. Having considered the scope 

and nature of the Group’s operations, the composition 

of the Board as well as its governance framework, 

the Board concluded that it is well–constituted with 

the right structure as the current board composition 

(board size of nine (9) members with a majority of 

independent directors and 89% of non–executive 

directors) has a high level of independence, with the 

Independent Directors constructively challenge and 

assist in developing proposals on strategies. The strong 

and independent element on the Board continued to 

allow the Board function eﬀ ectively at optimum levels 

during the year and exercise objective judgement on 

corporate aﬀ airs independently.

Board Orientation, Training and Development. The 

Board has adopted a set of best practice for Director’s 

training and development which is documented under 

a Policy on Induction, Training and Development for 

Directors (the “Training Policy”). The NC oversees and 

makes recommendations to the Board for training 

and professional development programs available 

to Directors, as well as induction for newly appointed 

Directors.

The Training Policy serves (i) to assist the new Director 

who is appointed to the Board for the ﬁ rst time to 

gain an understanding of his or her roles, duties, 

obligations and responsibilities as a Director of the 

Company, as well as the framework within which the 

Group operates; and (ii) to encourage all Directors to 

regularly review his or her training and professional 

development needs, to ensure the Directors have 

appropriate competencies to effectively fulfill their 

responsibilities to the Company and its Shareholders 

as well as stakeholders. A formal letter of appointment 

setting out the roles of a Director and the time 

commitment required, as well as information about 

the Group, its operations, business, practices and 

governance systems, is also issued to each newly 

appointed Director to ensure that the Director is aware 

of his or her duties and obligations.

The induction programme is tailored for each new 

Director (depending on his or her requirements, skills, 

qualiﬁ cations and experience) and will, as a mandatory 

requirement, request the new Director who has no 

prior experience as a director of a listed company to 

attend pre–requisite course for ﬁ rst–time appointee 

on boards of listed company, to familiarise himself 

or herself with the roles and responsibilities of a 

director of a public listed company. Mr Huang Xuhua 

and Mr Liu Jiannan, being the new directors appointed 

in FY2021, have completed the core Listed Entity 

Director (LED) Programme of the Singapore Institute 

of Directors (“SID”) organised with the support of the 

SGX–ST, within three (3) months of their appointment 

as Directors of the Company.

The Board welcomes the recent amendments to the 

Listing Manual which enhance, among others, the 

sustainability reporting for ﬁ nancial years beginning 

on or after 1 January 2022 and believes that these 

changes improve the quality of disclosures. The 

Company has arranged for all its Board members 

to undergo training on sustainability matters, the 

Environmental, Social and Governance Essentials 

programme organised by the SID. 

To ensure each Director fulfils the needed and 

desired competencies of the Board, and keep 

abreast of changes to the regulatory environment, 

Directors are encouraged to attend courses which 

are relevant to the Directors in discharging their roles 

and responsibilities, at the Company’s expense. The 

list of available seminars and courses is circulated to 

Directors through the board portal. Reading materials 

in connection with professional developments and 

applicable regulatory updates or amendments 

to relevant laws, rules and regulations are also 

disseminated to Directors through the board portal. 

Comprehensive and useful information covering the 

duties and obligations of a Director, TOR of Board 

Committees, Group’s business activities, strategic 

directions, policies and key areas of operations of the 

Group, are also provided in the resource centre under 

the board portal, and is accessible to all Directors. All 

Directors would be oﬀ ered the opportunity to visit the 

Group’s major operational sites and meet with any of 

the senior executives of the Group.

The Management regularly update the Board 

and provide insights on business and strategic 

developments at meetings. The Group’s external 

auditor, Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“EY”), regularly briefs the 

AC members on changes to, and new developments of 

accounting and reporting standards and/or regulatory 

environment.

Board and Management Succession. The NC is also 

tasked to recommend and review succession plans 

for the Company’s Directors and senior management, 

in particular for the Chairman, the CEO and the 

KMP, taking into account the Company’s strategic 

priorities, the challenges and opportunities facing 

the Group, the factors aﬀ ecting its long-term success 

and the skills and experience needed in the future. In 

reviewing succession plans, the NC constantly ensures 

that the Board and Management have the right and 

needed competencies for the Company’s long-term 

strategy and objectives. For orderly replacement of 

KMP, the Company integrates executive development 

programme into CEO and KMP succession planning, 

and builds talent internally through training, so that 

the best internal candidates are identiﬁ ed early and 

ﬂ agged at the Board level. Such executive development 

programme also allows the Company prepared for 

sudden and unforeseen changes. Where necessary 

or appropriate, the NC may tap on its networks and/

or engage external professional headhunters to assist 

with identifying and shortlisting candidates. The NC 

can also approach relevant institutions such as SID, 

professional organisations or business federations to 

source for suitable candidates.

Commitment to the Board. To ensure that each 

Director is able to devote suﬃ  cient time and attention 

to carrying out his role in accordance with his duties, 

the Board has determined that the maximum number 

of listed company board representations each Director 

of the Company is allowed to hold is as follows: 

(a) 

directorships without other executive roles – Six 

(6)

(b)  

directorships with other executive roles – Four 

(4)

Directors of the Company are required to notify the 

Board of any new appointment of directorships to 

listed companies or other principal commitments, for 

the Board or NC to consider and to evaluate whether 

such Director is able to commit the time to adequately 

carried out his duties as a Director of the Company.

Board Performance Evaluation. The Board has the 

duty to ensure that its members possess the essential 

background, experience and knowledge in the business 

and that the Directors’ attributes bring independent 

and objective perspective to enable sound, balanced 

and well–considered board decisions. The annual 

evaluation of the Board as a whole and of each Board 

Committee, as well as the contribution of the Chairman 

and each Director to the eﬀ ectiveness of the Board, 

is led by the NC with the support of the Company 

Secretary.

The NC decides how the Board’s performance may 

be evaluated to assess the eﬀ ectiveness of the Board. 

The performance of the Board and each of the Board 

Committees is assessed by the NC on its overall 

eﬀ ectiveness in accomplishing its goals and discharging 

its responsibilities based upon the following criteria:

(a) 

Board size and composition;

(b) 

Board governance processes;

(c) 

Board information and accountability;

(d) 

Board’s performance in relation to discharging 

its principal functions;

(e) 

where practical, financial references which 

include return on capital employed, return on 

equity, debt to equity ratio, dividend payout 

ratio, economic value added, earnings per share, 

and total shareholder return (i.e. dividend plus 

share price increase over the year); and

(f) 

Board Committees’ performance, qualiﬁ cation 

and eﬀ ectiveness in relation to discharging their 

responsibilities set out in their respective TOR.

The evaluation of Chairman aims to assess his 

leadership, commitment as well as his relationship 

with Board members, whereas the individual 

directors are evaluated based on his dedication and 

understanding of role, preparedness and participation 

in the meetings, as well as quality of inputs to matters 

deliberated by the Board.

The assessment provides insights into the functioning 

of the Board, whilst identifying areas that might need 

strengthening and development. Directors are invited 

to provide their views and suggestions for any speciﬁ c 

areas where improvements may be made to enhance 

Board eﬀ ectiveness. Every Director is also requested 

to complete an assessment of each Director’s 

contributions, including himself, to the eﬀ ectiveness of 

the Board, on anonymous basis.

Following the review for FY2021, the NC and the Board 

are satisﬁ ed that the Chairman as well as each Director 

has contributed to the overall effectiveness of the 

Board and demonstrates commitment to his roles on 

the Board, and that the Board and Board Committees 

operate effectively and have met their respective 

performance objectives. Notwithstanding that certain 

Directors have multiple board representations, these 

multiple directorships are not in conflict with the 

interests of the Company, and are within the maximum 

number of listed company board representations 

each Director of the Company is allowed to hold. No 

external facilitator was used in the evaluation process.

Taking into account the performance evaluation 

results, scope and nature of the Group’s operations 

as well as its strategic direction, the Company and 

the Board are satisfied that the Board and Board 

Committees are of the right size for eﬀ ective decision–

making, has the appropriate balance and mix of skills, 

expertise, knowledge, experience and collectively 

possesses the necessary core competencies in 

diverse areas that are relevant to the Company’s 

strategy, governance and business. The accounting, 

ﬁ nance, political or geopolitical savvy, business and 

management, strategic planning and global business 

experience underpin boardroom’s eﬀ ectiveness and 

eﬃ  ciency, enable the Board to eﬀ ectively discharge 

its duties. The collective skillset and global business 

experience of the Board support the Company to 

emerge from the COVID–19 crisis and push forward 

into a new era of economic recovery and opportunity 

for the beneﬁ t of all stakeholders.

Strategy and Investment Committee

The Company has a rigorous and continuing 

strategic planning process to identify and assess the 

opportunities and challenges that the Group might 

face and to develop a planned course of action for the 

Group to generate sustainable long–term value for 

Shareholders. 

The StratCom consists of four (4) members and 

chaired by the Board’s Chairman, Mr Liu Hongsheng. 

StratCom’s governing processes, duties and 

responsibilities have been documented under written 

TOR approved by the Board. StratCom supports the 

Board in the following areas:

(a) 

deﬁ ning and monitoring the Company’s strategic 

direction;

(b) 

reviewing and evaluating significant capital 

deployment and asset management; and

(c) 

working with the Management to oversee and 

review signiﬁ cant strategic decisions as well as 

major investment or divestment plans.

One (1) StratCom meeting was held in FY2021 

to review the Group’s prospects and long–term 

development strategic planning.

REMUNERATION MATTERS 

The Company has formal and transparent procedures 

for fixing the remuneration packages of individual 

Directors and KMP. Its remuneration policy seeks to 

ensure that the level and structure of remuneration 

are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained 

performance and value creation of the Group, taking 

into account the strategic objectives of the Group. 

Reviewing and making recommendations to the 

Board on the framework of remuneration for the 

Board and KMP as well as the speciﬁ c packages for 

each Director and the KMP, are the key functions 

of the RC. Information about the Remuneration 

Committee, including its work in FY2021, is set out in 

the Remuneration Committee Report.

Remuneration 

Framework. 

The 

Company’s 

remuneration and incentive framework, policies 

and practices are appropriate to attract Directors to 

provide good stewardship; retain and motivate KMP to 

successfully manage the Company for the long term. 

The RC may from time to time, and where necessary 

or required, seek advice from external consultants in 

framing its remuneration policy and determining the 

level and mix of remuneration for Directors and KMP.

Remuneration framework as well as the specific 

remuneration packages which is tailored to the speciﬁ c 

role and circumstances of each Director and KMP, 

including the CEO, are reviewed and discussed in the 

RC meeting.

The Company currently does not impose contractual 

provisions to reclaim incentive components of 

remuneration paid in prior years in the service 

agreements or employment agreements of the KMP. 

Notwithstanding this, the Company is not precluded 

from exercising the right to reclaim such incentives 

in exceptional circumstances including for example, 

misstatement of financial results or of misconduct 

resulting in ﬁ nancial loss to the Group. 

The remuneration of Directors and KMP as well as 

RC’s consideration on the remuneration package of 

each Director and KMP in respect of FY2021 have been 

agreed and approved by the Board, and are explicitly 

disclosed on a named basis, in the RC Report.

Overview on FY2021 Remuneration Programme. 

The Group’s remuneration policies are appropriate, 

effective, meet the commercial requirements to 

remain competitive, are sensitive to the time horizon 

of risk and allow ﬂ exibility in response to prevailing 

circumstances, and align with the long–term interest 

of the Group. Currently, there are no employee share 

schemes provided by the Company or the Group, and 

the Company does not have any long–term incentive 

plans. None of the Directors and KMP received 

any termination, retirement and post–employment 

beneﬁ ts. All Directors and the KMP are remunerated 

on an earned basis. There is no employee in the Group 

who is a substantial shareholder of the Company or 

immediate family member of a Director or the CEO or 

substantial shareholders.

Due to the vast number of countries that have been 

aﬀ ected, the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic has brought 

about a devastating impact on economic, social and 

environmental sustainability globally. The highly 

volatile business environment during the pandemic 

increased credit, operational, liquidity and market 

risks. Performance targets or the key performance 

indicators (“KPIs”) for the Management and KMP have 

been re–assessed and re–evaluated to keep up with 

the changes amid the crisis. While the Group’s revenue, 

proﬁ tability and growth targets remain important, KPIs 

for the KMP during these challenging times are also 

focus on operational resilience, on being agile and on 

business continuity. 

The Board, having assessed the Company’s resiliency, 

preparedness, and continued management of material 

ESG issues and risks both during and after the crisis, 

is of the view that the Management’s responses and 

actions taken in managing and improving the ﬁ nancial 

and operational resilience, as well as mitigating the 

impact of the crisis on employees, the communities 

and business continuity are commendable. It 

recognises that the Group’s business was not spared 

from the impact of economic downturn, and that the 

Management’s relentless efforts have succeeded 

in maximising opportunities and minimising the 

downside of pandemic–related disruptions.

In light of the above, the Board believes that the 

Company’s remuneration decision for FY2021 aligns 

with the long–term interests of Shareholders and 

other stakeholders, as well as the risk management 

policy of the Company. The Company did not engage 

any remuneration consultants or professional ﬁ rms in 

FY2021.

 

ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

The Board is accountable and answerable to the 

Shareholders for all aspects of the Company. 

It endeavours to ensure that Shareholders are 

furnished with timely information, full disclosure 

of material information and aims to present a 

balanced and understandable assessment of the 

Company’s performance, position and prospects to the 

Shareholders. It is imperative that the Shareholders 

are kept informed of the impact of COVID–19 on the 

Group’s operating environment, performance as well 

as management of sustainability issues. Its function 

relating to overseeing both internal and external audits 

is delegated to the AC. The main responsibility and 

objective of the AC is to assist the Board in fulﬁ lling 

its financial and other oversight responsibilities by 

serving as an independent and objective party to 

oversee, monitor and appraise the integrity of the 

Company’s financial reporting process, the internal 

controls and risk management systems as well as the 

audits processes. Signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings in the course of 

its reviews are reported to the Board.

The principal responsibility and activities of the AC are 

set out in the Audit Committee Report.

Risk Management and Internal Controls. The 

Board as a whole is responsible for the governance 

of risk and ensuring that an eﬀ ective system of risk 

management and overall internal controls framework 

are in place. It determines the nature and extent of the 

signiﬁ cant risks which is appropriate for the Company 

in achieving its strategic objection and creating 

value for the Shareholders. The Board oversees the 

design, implementation and monitoring of the risk 

management framework and policies, as well as 

the system of internal controls. It has significantly 

heightened vigilance on how the control environment 

is adapted to the new operating environment, 

including the information technology (“IT”) controls 

related to telecommuting, workplace safety, alternate 

capacities and procedures for continued auditing work, 

and placed close scrutiny on high–risk areas in the 

wake of COVID–19 crisis. 

The Board reviews the effectiveness of internal 

controls and ensures that Management puts in place 

action plans to mitigate the risks identified, and 

undertake remedial actions to rectify any control 

lapses. It devotes signiﬁ cant attention to maintaining 

an eﬀ ective system of risk management and internal 

controls, to safeguard the investment of the Company 

and its Shareholders, and ensure that risks are 

managed in the best interests of the Group. The 

principal risks facing the Company and the mitigation 

measures are described under the Risk Management 

section on pages 27 to 28 of this Annual Report.

In assessing the eﬀ ectiveness of the Group’s internal 

controls, the Board focuses on identifying control 

gaps in the business process, areas for improvement 

and areas where controls can be strengthened. 

This process assists in ensuring that primary key 

objectives are met, material assets are properly 

safeguarded, fraud or errors in the accounting 

records are prevented or detected, accounting records 

are accurate and complete, and reliable financial 

information is prepared in compliance with applicable 

internal policies, laws and regulations. The Company’s 

internal audits supplement the Group’s evaluation 

on all matters concerning internal controls, including 

the assessment of any issue identiﬁ ed in the course 

of internal audits as well as the administration and 

implementation of the Group’s internal policies and 

procedures.

The Company has a dedicated team which is 

responsible 

for 

developing, 

monitoring 

and 

maintaining risk management controls and reporting 

any key issues to Management. A risk management 

committee (“RMC”) formed by the Management which 

comprises the CEO, Managing Director – HRC Group, 

Chief Commercial Oﬃ  cer – Corrie MacColl Group and 

Chief Financial Oﬃ  cer (“CFO”), is responsible to assess 

and determine the nature and extent of the ﬁ nancial 

risks and position that the Company is allowed to 

take. The RMC assesses and evaluates the Group’s 

commercial strategy and position on a weekly basis. 

The Group Risk Management Policy which imposed 

appropriate measures and limits to control commercial 

risk exposures be reviewed regularly to ensure it is 

symmetric with market environment and Group’s 

operations.

The internal controls practice of each of the Group’s 

functions is reviewed annually or when circumstances 

warrant the review process. The Management 

constantly review the control environment including 

the legal and regulatory developments regarding 

COVID–19 as well as the Company’s risk–mitigation 

policies and protocols, and adjust such protocols 

as necessary to conform to developing regulatory 

circumstances, especially if a particular regulatory 

scheme relates to activities that are core to the 

Group’s operations, to enhance the standard operating 

procedures and ensure the business is fully compliant 

with the applicable regulations and Group’s policies. 

The Board’s commentary on the Company’s risk 

management and internal controls is set out on page 

83 of this Annual Report.

Financial Reporting. The Company’s financial 

results are prepared and presented in compliance 

with statutory requirements including applicable 

accounting standards and Listing Manual. The 

Company announces its half–yearly and full year 

unaudited ﬁ nancial statements through SGXNet within 

the timeline stipulated under the Listing Manual, and 

also provides voluntary interim business performance 

updates on ﬁ nancial and other operational metrics to 

the Shareholders periodically. It continues to comply 

with its continuing disclosure obligations to keep the 

Shareholders updated when appropriate, should there 

be any material developments (ﬁ nancial or otherwise) 

relating to the Company or the Group. 

Globally, there continues to be a high degree of 

uncertainty over the length of COVID–19 disruption, 

as well as the trajectory of the economic recovery. 

The Management continues to adopt a prudent 

and disciplined approach in its capital management 

strategy to monitor its cashﬂ ow and ensure suﬃ  cient 

liquidity headroom. The impact of the crisis on the 

Company’s cash ﬂ ow, status of upcoming maturities of 

outstanding indebtedness as well as compliance with 

ﬁ nancial covenants are reported to the AC regularly.

External Audits. The scope and results of auditing 

by the Company’s external auditors, EY, its cost 

effectiveness, as well as its independence and 

objectivity are reviewed by the AC annually. The AC and 

the Board are satisﬁ ed that the aggregate amount of 

audit fees paid and/or payable to EY in connection with 

the audit as well as non–audit services for FY2021 is 

appropriate. Having considered the relevant provisions 

under the applicable regulations, the cooperation 

extended by the Management and the fact that the 

non–audit services were provided by a separate team 

from EY, AC is of the view that the independence or 

objectivity of EY is not impaired. For details of fees 

paid and/or payable to EY in respect of audit and non–

audit services, please refer to Note 8 of the Notes to 

the Financial Statements on page 147 of this Annual 

Report. The appointment of external auditors of the 

Group complies with Rules 712 and 715 of the Listing 

Manual.

Internal audits. The primary functions of the internal 

audit function are to:

(a) 

assess the relevant risks related to the Group’s 

business operations and evaluate if an adequate 

system of internal controls is in place to protect 

the funds and assets of the Group;

(b) 

assess if operations of the business processes 

under review are conducted efficiently and 

eﬀ ectively and to ensure control procedures are 

complied with; and

(c) 

identify and recommend improvement to 

internal control procedures, where required.

The Board believes that outsourcing the internal 

audit function to a professional firm is beneficial 

as the professional service provider has a broad 

range of expertise, resources, advanced degrees and 

technological specialisation to undertake the internal 

audit of the Group, especially for the Group’s business 

which has global presence.

Internal audits are performed accordingly to the 

audit plan and scope agreed between the internal 

auditor, Nexia TS Risk Advisory Pte Ltd (“Nexia”) and 

the AC. Nexia reviews, then evaluates and tests the 

effectiveness of the internal controls on material 

business process including financial, operational, 

compliance, IT controls and the management of ESG–

related risks that are in place in each of the Group’s 

key operating units. 

Governance of Risk. The Board has the overall 

responsibility for evaluating and determining the 

nature and extent of the risks (including ESG–related 

risks) it is willing to take in achieving the Group’s 

strategic objectives, maintaining sound and eﬀ ective 

risk management and internal control systems 

(including those for ESG–related risks) and reviewing 

their effectiveness to safeguard Shareholders’ 

investment and the Group’s assets. The AC is tasked 

to assist the Board to oversee Management in the 

design, implementation and monitoring of the 

internal controls and risk management systems. This 

includes identifying weaknesses, assessing risks of 

the new possesses relating to COVID–19 measures, 

and recommending areas for improvement and 

additional risk mitigations, where necessary. The 

Management reviews the conditions of the industry 

and any factors or events that may aﬀ ect the Group’s 

operations, ensures that new risks and impacts from 

the crisis are appropriately detected and remediated, 

and presents its observation of the potential risks and 

mitigation action to the AC during quarterly meetings. 

Any material changes to the key risks areas are also 

reported to the AC as soon as they are identified. 

The AC reports annually to the Board, its view on the 

eﬀ ectiveness and adequacy of the Group’s internal 

controls (including ﬁ nancial, operational, compliance 

and IT controls) and risk management systems.

Anti–Corruption and Anti–Bribery. The Company 

is committed to conduct its business with integrity, 

fairness and transparency, actively preventing all forms 

of corruption. It takes a zero–tolerance stance on 

bribery and corruption in any form, direct or indirect 

and has procedures in place to comply with applicable 

anti–bribery laws and regulations. 

Under the Company’s Anti–Corruption and Anti–Bribery 

Policy which is reviewed by the AC periodically, the 

Directors, Management and employees of the Group 

must not, directly or indirectly, accept, oﬀ er, promise, 

agree to pay, authorise payment of, pay, give, accept 

or solicit anything of a signiﬁ cant value to or from 

any third party with the intention to secure or reward 

an improper beneﬁ t or improper performance of a 

function or activity. They should also avoid any conduct 

that creates even the appearance of improper activity 

or conduct.

The Company’s whistleblower mechanism supplements 

its fraud� and� corruption control system to prevent, 

detect and respond to incidents of fraud, bribery 

and corruption, and there have been no� established 

incidents pertaining to bribery and corruption in the 

Group.

Whistleblowing Framework. The Group embraces 

the best practices on whistleblowing and has put 

in place and published on the Company’s website, 

its Whistleblowing Policy as well as a channel to 

raise concerns about any suspected improprieties 

since 2013. The Whistleblowing Policy sets out the 

procedures and formal, confidential channels to 

enable whistleblower(s) (including employees and 

third–parties) to raise concerns about misconduct or 

wrongdoing relating to the Company and its oﬃ  cers, 

without fear of harassment and with an assurance that 

their reports will be taken seriously and investigated, 

and the outcome duly communicate. 

All whistleblowing matters come under the purview of 

the AC. Reports can be lodged through post, the online 

form provided under the Company’s website or via 

email at ac@halcyonagri.com and all whistleblowing 

reports will be channelled to the AC directly. All 

concerns raised will be independently assessed (parties 

who are related to the subject of the complaint must 

recuse themselves) to ensure that they are fairly 

and properly considered. The AC is responsible for 

oversight and monitoring of whistleblowing, and 

ensuring independent investigation of the reported 

concern, appropriate follow up actions are taken 

and issues raised are properly resolved by the 

Management or such parties as appropriate. 

The Company is committed to take all reasonable 

steps to protect the conﬁ dentiality and identity of a 

whistleblower, and it will not tolerate any harassment, 

retaliation, unfair treatment or victimisation of anyone 

reporting a genuine concern in good faith.

Summary of the Board and AC’s Observations for 

FY2021. The Board is of the view that the AC comprises 

members with requisite qualiﬁ cations and suﬃ  cient 

ﬁ nancial management expertise to discharge the AC’s 

functions competently. It has received assurances from 

the CEO and CFO that for FY2021:

(a) 

the Group’s financial records have been 

properly maintained and the financial 

statements give a true and fair view of the 

Group’s operations and ﬁ nances; and

(b) 

the Group’s risk management and internal 

controls systems are adequate and effective 

in addressing the financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology risks of 

the Group.

With the assurances from the CEO together with the 

CFO, and following its assessment on the following:

(a) 

the reviews of the reports of Nexia;

(b) 

the crisis management capability as well as the 

internal controls established and maintained by 

the Group;

(c) 

remedial actions taken by the Management 

according to internal auditor’s recommendations; 

and

(d) 

reports from EY,

the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the 

opinion that the Group’s present risk management and 

internal controls systems are adequate and eﬀ ective in 

addressing the ﬁ nancial, operational, compliance and 

information technology risks of the Group. However, 

the Board notes that the risk management and 

internal controls provide reasonable, but not absolute, 

assurance against material misstatements of loss, and 

include the safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of 

proper accounting records, the reliability of ﬁ nancial 

information, compliance with appropriate legislation, 

regulation and best practice, and the identification 

and containment of business risk. The Board also 

notes that all internal control systems contain inherent 

limitations and no system of internal controls can 

provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of 

material errors, poor judgement in decision–making, 

human error losses, fraud or other irregularities.

MATERIAL CONTRACT

Other than the service agreement entered into with 

the CEO and the IPTs as disclosed in this Annual Report 

and/or through SGXNet announcements, there were 

no material contracts (including loans) entered into 

by the Company or any of its subsidiaries involving 

the interest of the CEO, any Directors, or controlling 

shareholders which are either still subsisting at the end 

of FY2021 or if not then subsisting, entered into since 

the end of the previous ﬁ nancial year.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT

The Company’s corporate governance practices 

promote fair and equitable treatment of all 

Shareholders. Shareholders, as the owners of the 

Company, are entitled to attend and vote at general 

meetings, to a share of the Company’s proﬁ ts and 

all other rights pursuant to the Companies Act 1967 

(the “Companies Act”) as well as the provisions of the 

Company’s Constitution.

Shareholder Rights and Conduct of 

Shareholder Meetings

The Company’s general meetings provide an 

opportune forum for Shareholders to meet the Board 

and senior management and to interact with them. It 

is the Company’s principal forum for dialogue with 

Shareholders. In light of safe management measures 

amid COVID–19 outbreak, the 2021 AGM was held via 

electronic means in accordance with the COVID–19 

(Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and the COVID–19 

(Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for 

Meetings for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, 

Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) 

(Amendment) Order 2021.

Shareholders were invited to observe and/or 

listen to the 2021 AGM proceedings via live audio–

visual webcast. In order to understand the view of 

Shareholders, to gather inputs and address their 

concerns, Shareholders are encouraged to submit 

questions in advance of the general meeting. All 

substantial and relevant questions were addressed 

prior to the AGM through publication on the Singapore 

Exchange’s website and on the Company’s website.

General meetings are attended by all Directors 

whenever possible, and would normally be chaired 

by the Chairman of the Board. Chairmen of the Board 

Committees are also available at the meetings to 

answer any questions relating to the operations of the 

Board Committees. The Company’s external auditors 

are also present to address Shareholders’ queries 

about the conduct of audit and the preparation and 

content of the auditors’ report. Wherever practicable, 

updates on the Company’s performance and position 

are presented to the Shareholders in the general 

meetings, and such presentation materials are 

made available on the SGX–ST and the Company’s 

website prior to the meetings, for the beneﬁ t of the 

Shareholders.

The Company notiﬁ es the Shareholders on the meeting 

schedule and the agenda of meeting at least 14 or 21 

days (as the case may be) prior to the date appointed 

for the general meeting. The notice of general meeting 

issued to all Shareholders is advertised in newspapers 

(where applicable) and disseminated through SGXNet, 

as well as published on the Company’s website. 

The notice convening the 2021 AGM was published 

31 days in advance of the date of the 2021 AGM, to 

allow ample time for the dissemination of details 

relating to the alternative arrangements for the 

2021 AGM, considering that the Shareholders 

could have more questions on the impact of the 

COVID–19�disruptions to the Company.

Rules (including the appointment of proxy(ies) and 

voting procedures) that govern the attendance for 

general meetings are clearly set out in the notice of 

general meeting as well as the proxy form. Pursuant 

to the Constitution, every Shareholder is entitled 

to attend and vote at the general meetings of the 

Company and is allowed to appoint not more than 

two (2) proxies to vote on his/her behalf at the general 

meetings during his/her absence. Notwithstanding, 

speciﬁ ed intermediaries such as CPF, banks and capital 

market services license holders which provide custodial 

services are allowed to appoint multiple proxies.

Sufficient and necessary information required for 

Shareholders to make informed decisions is provided 

or accompanied by the notice convening each general 

meeting. At general meetings, each issue is proposed 

as a separate resolution. The Company continued to 

adopt and comply with the voting process stipulated 

under the Guidance on the Conduct of General 

Meetings amid Evolving COVID–19 Situation, for the 

unconventional AGM held in year 2021. Shareholders 

(whether individual or corporate) who wish to vote on 

the resolutions tabled at the AGM have to appoint the 

chairman of the AGM as their proxy to vote on their 

behalf. The voting outcomes including the number of 

votes cast for and against were validated by the polling 

agent prior to the 2021 AGM, and results of the poll 

are displayed on–screen during the virtual meeting 

proceeding. The poll results also be announced to the 

public through SGXNet in accordance with the format 

prescribed under the Listing Manual.

The proceedings of general meetings are properly 

recorded and the minutes of the 2021 AGM are 

published on SGXNet and on the Company’s website 

within one (1) month after the meeting.

The record of Directors’ attendance at the general 

meeting held in FY2021 is set out on page 73 of this 

Annual Report.

Dividend Policy

The Company did not have a fixed dividend policy 

since it was listed in 2013. It continually reviews 

strategic options to enhance shareholder value, 

including potential acquisitions or realisation of 

assets. Notwithstanding that any strategic action that 

could affect the allocation of funds, to promote a 

more transparent, long–term approach, the Company 

decided to adopt a dividend policy to clearly set out 

its approach to dividends as the Board recognises 

that dividends are one of the most eﬃ  cient ways of 

returning capital to Shareholders.

The Company’s dividend policy is based on a 

payout ratio of up to 20% of its Core PATMI1, barring 

unforeseen circumstances. Dividend payments are 

also affected by various factors such as level of 

earnings, the Company’s development prospects, 

its ﬁ nancial position and funding needs, the overall 

macroeconomic situation and market conditions as 

well as other legal or contractual restrictions that may 

be applicable from time to time. 

The Company’s dividend policy ensures that its capital 

allocation is being decided in a way that delivers long–

term, sustainable returns. In considering the level 

of dividend payments, the Board will consider all of 

the above factors and strive to ensure that its capital 

allocation are being decided in a way that delivers 

long–term, sustainable returns.

For FY2021, the Board does not recommend dividend 

as the amount of Core PATMI is not substantial. The 

Company believes that it is appropriate to retain 

and reinvest such earnings in the Group, to allow 

greater ﬂ exibility on capital management and ensure 

availability of financial resources to respond to 

temporary disruptions and to aid in medium–term 

recovery.

Engagement with Shareholders

The Company recognises that eﬀ ective communication 

with investors assists the creation and maintenance 

of an informed market, and enhances corporate 

governance by encouraging a culture of transparency 

in relation to its corporate activities and proposals. 

The Company gives Shareholders a balanced and 

understandable assessment of its performance, 

position and prospects, and informs Shareholders 

immediately of any major or material developments 

or events that have an impact on the Group or may 

influence their investment decisions. To facilitate 

Shareholders’ rights and to ensure fair communication 

with the Shareholders, all information about the 

Company’s new initiatives which would be likely to 

materially aﬀ ect the price or value of the Company’s 

shares are promptly disseminated to Shareholders 

through the following platforms:

(a) 

SGXNet announcements and news release;

(b) 

annual report and notice of general meetings 

issued to all Shareholders;

(c) 

press releases on major developments of the 

Group;

(d) 

the Company’s general meeting; and

(e) 

the corporate website (https://www.halcyonagri.

com) maintained by the Company that allows 

all stakeholders to stay informed of material 

updates in a timely manner.

The Company has in place an Investor Relations 

Policy which allows for an ongoing exchange of 

views so as to actively engage and promote regular, 

eﬀ ective and fair communication with Shareholders. 

The Company employs various platforms, including 

brieﬁ ng for analysts after the release of its ﬁ nancial 

results whenever practicable, to eﬀ ectively engage the 

Shareholders and the investment community, with 

an emphasis on timely, accurate, fair and transparent 

disclosure of information. Shareholders or public may

online submission form under the Company’s website.

Apart from statutory announcements, the Company’s

operations, important dates and recapitulate any 

major announcements. Materials relating to the Group 

including the ﬁ nancial results, press releases, annual 

reports and various other investor–related information 

are also available on the corporate website.

ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Ethical and ecologically sustainable business practices 

are fundamental to the Company’s strategy for long–

term growth. Understanding stakeholder perspectives 

is critical to determining, assessing and managing 

key risks and issues. As such, the Company has 

arrangements in place to identify and engage with 

the material stakeholder groups, including employees 

and those working across the supply chain. It adopts 

an inclusive approach to balance the needs and 

interests of material stakeholders, as part of its 

overall responsibility to ensure the best interests of 

the Company are served. The Company is committed 

to operating as a responsible and sustainable 

business during these challenging times and that the 

management of material ESG factors will continue 

to be the key focus of the Management to drive 

sustainable and resilient recovery.

HeveaConnect, a joint venture between the Company, 

ITOCHU Corporation, DBS Bank Ltd. and Asian Gateway 

Investments Pte. Ltd., a wholly–owned subsidiary of the 

Singapore Exchange Limited, is one of the Company’s 

major initiatives which aims to connect natural rubber 

stakeholders in the rubber industry and supports the 

Company’s commitment towards a more sustainable 

rubber industry. HeveaConnect digital marketplace 

aims to promote greater price transparency in the 

natural rubber market, and serves as an all–inclusive 

platform for farmers, producers, tyre manufacturers, 

as well as facilitators such as financial institutions, 

logistics and warehousing suppliers. Its goal is to be 

the leading digital marketplace for sustainable natural 

rubber, which promotes eco–friendly practices and 

embraces supply chain transparency.

1 Core PATMI refers to proﬁ t attributable to owners of the Company, net of tax, excluding changes in fair value of biological assets as well as the 

extraordinary and exceptional items.

The COVID–19 pandemic has created significant 

environmental, health and safety and social impacts, 

risks and challenges for workforces across the 

economies where the Group operates, disrupting 

supply chain and affecting considerations for 

stakeholder engagement. The Company remains 

committed to working with stakeholders and engages 

them at all levels including customers, competitors, 

industry associations, employees, regulators, and 

suppliers, to combat the COVID–19 impact and 

navigate the challenges.

Other information on the Group’s corporate social 

responsibility initiatives and engagements with 

material stakeholder groups is set out under the 

Sustainability Report contained within this Annual 

Report.

DEALING IN SECURITIES

The Company observes and complies with Rule 

1207(19) of the Listing Manual on dealings in 

securities and issues notices to its Directors, oﬃ  cers 

and employees on the restrictions in dealing in the 

Company’s securities during the period commencing 

one (1) month before the announcement of the 

Company’s half–yearly and full year ﬁ nancial results, 

and ending on the date of the announcement of 

the relevant results. Notices prohibiting dealing in 

Company’s securities will also be sent to the Group’s 

Directors, officers and employees as and when 

circumstances are deemed appropriate, such as when 

a discussion relating to an acquisition is expected to 

take a long period of time before it achieves certainty.

Directors, officers and employees are reminded 

periodically not to trade in the Company’s securities 

at any time while in possession of unpublished 

price sensitive information, and to refrain from 

dealing in the Company’s securities on short–term 

considerations. They are also advised to be mindful 

of the laws on insider trading at all times even when 

dealing in securities within the permitted trading 

period.

INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 

(“IPT”)

The assessment of IPT is under the purview of the 

AC, to ensure that any transaction to be entered into 

with interested persons (as defined in the Listing 

Manual) will be assessed independently, and that the 

transaction is carried out on normal commercial terms 

and are not prejudicial to the interests of the Company 

or its minority Shareholders.

Any contract to be made with an interested person 

will not be proceeded with unless the pricing is 

determined in accordance with the Group’s usual 

business practices and policies, consistent with the 

usual margin given or price received by the Group for 

the same or substantially similar type of transactions 

with the unrelated parties, and that the terms are not 

more favourable to the interested person than those 

extended to or received from unrelated parties. Where 

it is impractical or not possible to compare against the 

terms of other transactions with unrelated third parties 

or in situations where the products or services may be 

purchased only from an interested person, such IPT 

must be reviewed and approved by the AC, and the AC 

member who is perceived to be related to the interest 

person is refrained from deliberating, reviewing and 

approving that particular transaction.

The Company does not have a general mandate from Shareholders for IPT. Consequently, there have been no 

IPT conducted under shareholders’ mandate pursuant to Rule 920 of the Listing Manual. The details of the IPT 

transacted by the Group during FY2021 (excluding transactions less than $100,000) are as follows:

The NC reviewed the structure, size, and diversity of 

the Board to ensure that its composition complies 

with the Code and reﬂ ects an appropriate mix of skills, 

experience, and diversity objectives that are relevant to 

the Company’s strategy, governance, businesses, and 

contributes to the Board’s eﬀ ectiveness and eﬃ  ciency. 

To further enhance Board independence and diversity, 

NC has determined the appointment of a new 

independent director with legal expertise is beneﬁ cial 

to the Board. 

During its search and evaluation process for the new 

independent director, the NC has considered various 

factors and intentionally included female candidate in 

order to achieve the Board’s gender diversity target. In 

its evaluation of potential candidates for nomination, 

the NC has considers the speciﬁ c needs of the Board. 

As the skill sets and competencies were the dominant 

factors for the selection of the new independent 

The Nominating Committee (“NC”) is delegated with the authority by the Board to review the Board’s composition 

and diversity, make recommendations to the Board on the appointment of Directors and members to the Board 

Committees, and assess Independent Director’s independence and commitment. The NC is also responsible 

for succession planning for Directors and KMP, leadership training and development, and oversight of matters 

relating to corporate governance.

The NC comprises four (4) members and is chaired by Mr Lam Chun Kai, an Independent Director. The Lead 

Independent Director, Mr Alan Rupert Nisbet, is also a member of the NC. It functions within clearly written terms 

of reference approved by the Board.

director, NC has recommended and the Board has 

approved the appointment of Mr Huang Xuhua (“Mr 

Huang”), an experienced lawyer who is qualiﬁ ed in a 

number of jurisdictions, as an Independent Director of 

the Company in June 2021.

At the same time, Mr Liu Jiannan (‘Mr Liu”) was 

appointed to the Board as proposed by China–Africa 

Development Fund (“CADF”), the parent company of 

the Company’s substantial shareholder, in place of Mr 

Wang Wei, its nominee director who has resigned from 

CADF to pursue professional and personal interests.

In its nomination of Mr Huang and Mr Liu for 

appointment to the Board, the NC has also considered 

the specific needs of the Board, as well as their 

ability to contribute to discussions, deliberations and 

activities of the Board.

Nomination for Re–election 

Pursuant to the Company’s Constitution, at least three 

(3) Board members shall retire by rotation and that 

the Directors appointed after the 2021 AGM to ﬁ ll the 

casual vacancies, namely Mr Huang and Mr Liu, shall 

hold office only until the forthcoming AGM (“2022 

AGM”). 

The NC has identiﬁ ed Mr Liu Hongsheng (“Chairman 

Liu”) and Mr Qin Jinke, being the Directors who have 

been longest in oﬃ  ce since their last election, together 

with Mr Alan Rupert Nisbet (“Mr Nisbet”), shall retire 

by rotation at the 2022 AGM. Mr Nisbet has served on 

the Board for a continuous period of more than nine 

(9) years. He has decided to retire at the conclusion of 

the 2022 AGM to support progressive renewal of the 

Board.

Given the expertise and past experience of the four 

(4) Directors who have offered themselves for re–

election at the 2022 AGM, NC considered that their 

appointment would ensure the Board’s diversity and 

benefit the future development of the Company. 

Accordingly, the NC has nominated Mr Huang, 

Mr Liu, Chairman Liu and Mr Qin to the Board, for it 

to recommend to Shareholders for re–election at the 

2022 AGM. 

The nominations were made in accordance with the 

Nomination Policy and took into account the merits 

of the candidates including, among others, their 

experience, reputation for integrity, time commitment 

and the diversity aspects (including without limitation, 

gender, age, cultural and educational background, 

ethnicity, professional experience, skills, and 

knowledge), with due regard for the benefits of 

diversity, as set out in the Diversity Policy.

Upcoming Changes in Board

Mr Nisbet, the Lead Independent Director who was 

re–appointed to the Board as an Independent Director 

through the two–tiers voting process in the last annual 

general meeting, has expressed his intention to retire 

at the 2022 AGM and will not be seeking re–election. 

The details relating to the cessation of Mr Nisbet’s 

service have been disclosed via an SGXNet filing 

published on 25 February 2022.

To fill the vacancy following the retirement of Mr 

Nisbet, the NC has initiated the process to identify 

potential candidates for the appointment as 

Independent Director. The NC will review the proﬁ les 

of the candidates, having regard to the Board’s 

current composition, the Directors’ skill matrix, the 

list of selection criteria for Independent Director, the 

Nomination Policy, the Diversity Policy, and will arrange 

interviews with the shortlisted candidates individually. 

The appointment of Director will be announced to the 

public through SGXNet in a timely manner.

Independence of Director

Non–executive Directors’ independence is assessed 

upon appointment, annually, and as and when 

circumstances warrant reconsideration. The NC 

reviews and determines whether a Director is 

independent. During the year, each of the Independent 

Directors has submitted a declaration form conﬁ rming 

that he is to be considered independent under the 

requirements of Rule 210(5)(d) of the Listing Manual 

as well as the provisions set out in the Code. Taking 

into consideration the declarations submitted by 

the Independent Directors, as well as the length 

that the Director has served on the Board, the NC 

affirmed that each of the Independent Directors is 

independent in conduct, character and judgement, 

and has no relationship with the Company, its related 

corporations, its substantial shareholders or its 

oﬃ  cers, and there has been no element that could 

interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with 

the exercise of the Director’s independent business 

judgement in the best interests of the Group. 

It was also noted that none of the Independent 

Directors or their family members was employed by, or 

received signiﬁ cant payment from or provided material 

services to the Group in FY2021 or in any of the past 

three (3) ﬁ nancial years. 

There is a strong and independent element on 

the Board, with Independent Directors make up a 

majority of the Board under the leadership of a Lead 

Independent Director.

Board Performance Evaluation

Based on the assessment criteria2 determined by 

the NC, the formal evaluation questionnaires were 

tabulated and circulated to all Directors via the board 

portal, for Directors to rate and provide feedback on 

the performance of the Board, the Board Committees, 

the Chairman and each Director for FY2021. The 

ﬁ ndings of the Board evaluation (including feedback 

and comments received from the Directors) have been 

analysed and discussed during the NC meeting, in 

consultation with the Chairman of the Board to identify 

areas for improvement and any training required to 

further enhance the eﬀ ectiveness of the Board. The 

Board reviewed feedback from the NC collectively and 

will decide and agree on action plans, if required.

The FY2021 evaluation results indicated that the Board 

operates eﬀ ectively, and the Board was satisﬁ ed with 

the operational eﬀ ectiveness of the Board committees 

as well as the competencies of each Director.

2 Evaluation criteria is described under the Corporate Governance Report.

The Remuneration Committee (“RC”) is delegated with the authority by the Board to establish, review, and 

make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s remuneration policy and practices. It ensures that 

the remuneration framework is in line with the Group’s business strategy, objectives, values and long–term 

sustainability of the business. 

The RC is chaired by an Independent Director, Mr Liew Choon Wei, and comprises Mr Alan Rupert Nisbet and Mr 

Liu Hongsheng. All members of the RC are non–executive directors and none of the RC members is allowed to 

participate in the deliberation, and has to abstain from voting on any resolution, relating to his own remuneration 

or that of employees related to him.

The RC held two (2) meetings in FY2021. Members’ attendance records are disclosed in the Corporate Governance 

Report contained in this Annual Report. 

Summary of RC’s principal activities during FY2021



Reviewed the directors’ fees structure 



Reviewed and approved the performance scorecard for the CEO and KMP



Reviewed and recommended to the Board, the remuneration of each Director 



Evaluated the performance of the CEO and KMP, and recommended their remuneration package to the Board



Endorsed the FY2021 Corporate Governance Report 

Developing Group Remuneration Framework

In assessing the Group’s remuneration framework, the 

RC considers all aspects of remuneration (including 

directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, 

share–based incentives and awards, beneﬁ ts in kind 

and severance packages) and aims to be fair and 

avoid rewarding poor performance. It also reviews 

the Company’s obligations arising in the event of 

termination of the CEO’s and KMP’s contracts of 

service, to ensure that such contracts contain fair 

and reasonable termination clauses which are not 

overly generous. It may from time to time, and where 

necessary or required, seek advice from external 

consultants in framing its remuneration policy and 

determining the level and mix of remuneration for 

Directors and KMP.

In respect of long–term incentive schemes (if any, 

including share schemes as may be implemented), the 

RC is responsible for considering whether Directors 

should be eligible for beneﬁ ts under such long–term 

incentive schemes. Any recommendation of the RC 

will be submitted to the Board for consideration and 

approval. The Board is ultimately accountable for all 

remuneration decisions.

Where applicable, the RC will also review annually the 

remuneration of employees related to the Directors, 

the CEO and substantial shareholders to ensure that 

their remuneration packages are in line with the staﬀ 

remuneration guidelines and commensurate with their 

respective job scopes and level of responsibilities. 

The RC will also review and approve any bonuses, pay 

increases and/or promotions for these employees, if 

any.

Agreeing the Level and Mix of Remuneration 

The key considerations of the RC in recommending the 

level and mix of remuneration are:

(a) 

to link rewards with value creation and oﬀ er 

appropriate remuneration and employment 

conditions to build, motivate and retain 

Directors, KMP and talent;

(b) 

to align the interests of Directors and KMP 

with the interests of Shareholders and other 

stakeholders; and

(c) 

risk policies of the Company, such that the 

remuneration is symmetric with risk outcome 

and sensitive to the time horizon of risk; and 

(d) 

country–speciﬁ c practices including the pay and 

employment conditions within the industry.

When it recommends the remuneration package 

to the Board, the RC takes into consideration the 

aforementioned factors, the strategic direction of 

the Group and industry practice, and benchmarks 

the remuneration package against relevant industry 

players to ensure an appropriate remuneration level 

and mix that recognises the performance, potential 

and responsibilities of these individuals.

Reviewing Non–executive Directors’ Fees 

Structure

The remuneration for each non–executive Director 

which comprise a basic fee and attendance fees 

(the “Directors’ Fees”), are appropriate to the level of 

contribution, taking into account factors such as eﬀ ort, 

time spent, and responsibilities. Directors’ Fees are 

reviewed annually by the RC to benchmark such fees 

against the amounts paid by other listed companies of 

similar size. 

The Directors’ Fees structure which was adopted since 2017 is as follows:

Position

Basic Fee per annum (S$)

Attendance Fee 

(S$)

The RC has commissioned an experienced external consultant to conduct a benchmarking exercise to assess the 

appropriateness of the existing remuneration components for the non–executive Directors based on industry 

benchmarks and accepted methodologies. RC will review and determine the Directors’ Fees structure for the 

ﬁ nancial year ending 31 December 2022 (“FY2022”) after it receives the benchmarking report from the consultant.

The Company submits the quantum of Directors’ Fees of each ﬁ nancial year, which is to be paid quarterly in 

arrears, to Shareholders for approval at its annual general meeting. Shareholders’ approval will be sought at the 

2022 AGM in respect of the proposed payment of Directors’ fees of up to S$750,000 (payable quarterly in arrears) 

for FY2022.

The total remuneration paid to the three (3) KMP (who are not Directors or the CEO) for FY2021 was 

approximately S$1,737,000, and has been approved by the Board. 

Remuneration Consideration for Executive Director and KMP

Performance measures and remuneration packages 

of the Executive Director and KMP emphasise on 

value creation and are principally based on the 

achievement of the objectives of their functions as 

set up in the key performance indicators (“KPIs”) 

agreed by each individual. These KPIs take into 

consideration the performance of the Company, the 

Management’s performance in light of COVID–19, 

scope of work, overall organisational health, 

potential and responsibilities of these individuals, 

and leadership in the face of unexpected challenges. 

Qualitative evaluation, such as vocational competence, 

responsibility at work and activity in the workplace, as 

well as the quality of work in relation to the demands 

and goals of duties, have also been used to evaluate 

and assess the Management’s performance in FY2021. 

The aggregate remuneration of S$607,029.75 paid 

to the non–executive Directors (the “Directors’ Fees”) 

for FY2021 is within the threshold limit of S$750,000 

approved by Shareholders on 15 June 2021. The non–

executive Directors were remunerated according to the 

Directors’ Fee structure disclosed in the annual report 

for the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2020.

Remuneration of the executive Director (who is also 

the CEO) comprising basic salary as well as a variable 

bonus which has been reviewed by the RC and 

approved by the Board, and is paid in accordance with 

his service agreement with the Company.

RC is satisﬁ ed that the Executive Director and KMP 

devoted the necessary time and energy to fulﬁ lling 

its commitments, and have met the aforementioned 

performance conditions in FY2021. 

Specific remuneration packages for the Executive 

Director and KMP in respect of FY2021 have been 

reviewed by the RC and approved by the Board.

The Audit Committee (“AC”) is delegated with the 

authority by the Board to provide independent 

oversight of the Group’s financial reporting and 

internal control systems, and the adequacy of the 

external and internal audits. The AC is provided with 

suﬃ  cient resources as well as supports to perform 

its duties, in examining all matters relating to the 

Group’s adopted accounting principles and practices, 

and in reviewing all material ﬁ nancial, operational and 

compliance controls.

The AC is chaired by the Lead Independent Director, 

Mr Alan Rupert Nisbet, and comprise only non–

executive Directors, namely, Mr Liew Choon Wei, Mr 

Qin Jinke, Mr Lam Chun Kai and Mr Eddie Chan Yean 

Hoe. The members of the AC are professionals who 

have extensive experience in senior management 

positions, including two (2) retired audit partners from 

Big Four accounting ﬁ rms with extensive accounting 

and ﬁ nancial management expertise. The AC members 

are therefore appropriately qualified to discharge 

their responsibilities. None of the AC members were 

previous partners or directors of the Company’s 

external audit ﬁ rm within the last two (2) years and 

none of the AC members hold any ﬁ nancial interest in 

such external audit ﬁ rm.

Pursuant to the written terms of reference (“TOR”) 

endorsed by the Board, AC has the following key 

functions:

(a) 

oversight of ﬁ nancial reporting, monitor integrity 

of the Group’s financial statements and any 

public ﬁ nancial reporting;

(b) 

review the assurance provided by the CEO and 

the CFO on the ﬁ nancial records and ﬁ nancial 

statements;

(c) 

review and recommend to the Board, the 

appointment or re–appointment of the external 

auditors and matters relating to their removal, 

remuneration and terms of engagement;

(d) 

review and evaluate at least annually the 

adequacy, eﬀ ectiveness, independence, scope 

and results of internal and external audits;

(e) 

review and report to the Board at least 

annually on the effectiveness and adequacy 

of the Company’s internal controls and risk 

management systems;

(f) 

review interested person transactions involving 

the Group in accordance with the Listing 

Manual;

(g) 

review and approve future hedging policy, 

instruments used for hedging and foreign 

exchange policy and practice of the Group; 

(h) 

review whistleblowing policy arrangement, lead 

the independent investigations and ensure 

appropriate follow–up actions, if any; and 

(i) 

generally undertake such other functions and 

duties as may be required by the Listing Manual.

To ensure it could discharge its functions properly, 

AC has the explicit authority to investigate any 

matters within its TOR and has full access to and the 

cooperation of Management. The AC has full discretion 

to invite any Director or executive oﬃ  cer to attend 

any AC meeting to answer questions which the AC 

may have. It also has direct access to the Company’s 

external auditors and is conferred the authority to 

source external resources including obtaining legal 

or other professional advice and services. It may 

commission an independent audit on internal controls 

and risk management for its assurance, or where it is 

not satisﬁ ed with the systems of internal controls and 

risk management.

Review of Financial Results 

The AC safeguards the integrity in ﬁ nancial reporting 

and ensures such reporting is in compliance with the 

requirements of the Singapore Financial Reporting 

Standards. It reviews all announcements relating to 

the Company’s ﬁ nancial performance, and oversees 

signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial reporting issues and assessments, 

in particular, reviews the Group’s application and 

consistency of financial and accounting policies, 

judgements and practices. The AC, when satisﬁ ed that 

the ﬁ nancial results and related announcements meet 

statutory requirements, would submit and recommend 

the release of the financial results and related 

announcements to the Board. Any signiﬁ cant issues 

and judgement that AC considered in relation to the 

ﬁ nancial statements and the actions to address such 

concerns will also be reported to the Board.

The AC reviewed the FY2021 audited financial 

statements in conjunction with the external 

auditor. Based on this review and discussions with 

Management, the AC was satisﬁ ed that the ﬁ nancial 

statements were prepared in accordance with 

applicable accounting standards and fairly present 

the Group’s ﬁ nancial position and results for the year 

ended 31 December 2021.

Review of External Audits and 

Re–appointment of External Auditor

AC reviews the overall scope of external audits prior 

to each audit process, to ensure material areas are 

covered and sufficient attention is dedicated to 

emerging and existential risk. During the course of 

review of the Company’s financial statements for 

FY2021, the AC has reviewed and discussed each 

of the KAMs with the Management as well as the 

external auditor, Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“EY”). The AC has 

assessed and considered the Management’s approach, 

methodology and assumptions applied to each of the 

KAMs, and was satisﬁ ed with the appropriateness of 

the analyses performed by the Management. The AC 

agrees and concurs with the basis and conclusions 

included in EY’s report with respect to the KAMs. 

For more information on the KAMs, please refer to 

page 111 of this Annual Report.

Taking into consideration all relevant factors (with 

reference to the audit quality indicators as published 

by the Accounting and Regulatory Authority) including 

the adequacy of resources, experience of supervisory 

and professional staff to be assigned to the audit 

process, the quality of work carried out by EY, the 

size and complexity of the Group, its businesses and 

operations, AC was satisfied with EY’s work, its 

independence, and its objectivity, and therefore 

recommended the re–appointment of EY (which has 

indicated its willingness to continue in oﬃ  ce) as the 

Group’s external auditor for Shareholders’ approval at 

the 2022 AGM. The appointment of external auditors 

of the Group complies with Rules 712 and 715 of the 

Listing Manual.

Summary of AC’s principal activities during FY2021



Reviewed the Group’s quarterly, half–yearly, and annual ﬁ nancial results



Reviewed, with both the external auditor and management, the audit approach and methodology applied, 

in particular to the key audit matters (“KAMs”) included in the Auditor’s Report

Review of Internal Audit Functions

AC decides on the appointment, termination and 

remuneration of Nexia TS Risk Advisory Pte Ltd 

(“Nexia”), the Group’s internal auditor since May 2013. 

To ensure that the review on internal controls is 

conducted eﬀ ectively, Nexia’s primary reporting line 

is to the AC, and it is granted unfettered access to all 

the Company’s documents, records, properties and 

personnel.

Nexia presented the internal audit reports, which 

compile the detailed findings relevant to the 

Group’s key operating units that it had reviewed, 

to the AC during quarterly meetings. Any material 

non–compliance or failure in internal controls, 

recommendations for improvements and remedial 

actions taken by Management are reported to the 

AC. If action plans to mitigate the risks are required, 

the AC would instruct and ensure that Management 

undertakes follow–up actions.

The AC reviews the adequacy, effectiveness, 

independence and scope of the internal audit function 

annually, including the internal audit plans, activities, 

budget for internal audit and organisational structure 

of Nexia. It is satisﬁ ed that the internal audit function 

is independent, eﬀ ective and that the internal audit 

activity conducted by Nexia for FY2021 attained 

professional standards, including those promulgated 

by The Institute of Internal Auditors. Given that there 

is a team of 11 members assigned to the Company’s 

internal audits and led by Ms Pamela Chen who has 15 

years of relevant experience, the AC believes that the 

internal audit function is adequately resourced and has 

appropriate standing within the Group during FY2021. 

It is also of the view that the quantum of fee paid or 

payable to Nexia should not put its objectivity at risk.

Review of Risk management and Internal 

Control Systems

The AC is tasked to oversee the Group’s overall risk 

management framework and to advise the Board on 

the Group’s risk–related matters. It reviews the Group’s 

risk policies and assesses the effectiveness of the 

Group’s risk management and internal control systems. 

AC has reviewed the up–to–date risk register, the 

implementation and execution of standard operating 

procedures, as well as remedial actions recommended 

by the internal auditor and implemented by 

Management. 

The AC meets with the internal and external auditors 

without the presence of Management at least once 

a year, to obtain feedback on the competency and 

adequacy of the finance function and to ascertain 

if there are any material weaknesses or control 

deficiencies in the Group’s financial reporting and 

operational systems.

The AC is satisfied that the Group has adequate 

and eﬀ ective risk management and internal control 

systems, and that the Group has satisfactorily 

managed the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic.

Review of Whistleblowing Framework

The AC is responsible for the overall oversight and 

monitoring of the whistleblowing framework and its 

implementation. In particular, the AC considers all 

whistleblowing complaints and reviews them at its 

quarterly meetings to ensure independent, thorough 

investigation and appropriate follow–up actions. The

Report on the audit of the ﬁ nancial statement

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company”) and its 

subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”), which comprise the statements of ﬁ nancial position of the Group and the 

Company as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive 

income and consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement of the Group and the statements of changes in equity of the 

Group and the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the ﬁ nancial statements, including a summary of 

signiﬁ cant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Group, the statement of ﬁ nancial 

position and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the 

provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) 

(“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated ﬁ nancial position of the Group and the ﬁ nancial 

position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and of the consolidated ﬁ nancial performance, consolidated 

changes in equity and consolidated cash ﬂ ows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year 

then ended.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSA”s). Our responsibilities 

under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 

Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and 

Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and 

Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 

ﬁ nancial statements in Singapore, and we have fulﬁ lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 

these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃ  cient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁ cance in our audit of 

the ﬁ nancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 

ﬁ nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 

on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in 

that context.

We have fulﬁ lled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁ nancial 

statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the 

performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 

ﬁ nancial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the 

matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements.

1. 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how 

 

As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s goodwill and process know-how amounted to US$286,379,000 and 

US$10,000,000 respectively. These represent approximately 41% of the Group’s net assets. 

 

We focused on the impairment assessment of goodwill and process know-how because the impairment 

testing of the cash generating units (“CGUs”) attributable to these intangibles rely on estimates of 

value-in-use (“VIU”) based on the CGU’s expected future cash ﬂ ows. We considered audit of these cash 

ﬂ ow projections to be a key audit matter as these involved signiﬁ cant management judgement, and 

are based on assumptions that are aﬀ ected by expected future market and economic conditions. In 

addition, judgement has also been exercised by management in identifying the appropriate CGUs for the 

impairment test. 

 

The Group uses assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions such as forecasted 

rubber price, forecasted sales volume and margin, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates. We assessed 

and tested these assumptions which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive and data inputs 

by comparing them to historical performance of the CGU and industry outlook reports. We engaged 

our valuation specialists to assist us with the audit of the reasonableness of management’s valuation 

methodologies and certain assumptions used. 

 

We also reviewed the Group’s process in identifying changes to CGUs to which goodwill and/or intangible 

assets have been allocated to. We obtained and evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses to ascertain 

the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and we performed our own independent 

sensitivity calculations to quantify the downside changes to management’s models required to result in an 

impairment.

 

We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures concerning those key assumptions to which the outcome 

of the impairment test is most sensitive. The disclosures on goodwill and process know-how and key 

assumptions are included in Note 11 to the ﬁ nancial statements. 

2. 

Measurement of biological assets 

 

As at 31 December 2021, biological assets of the Group amounted to US$360,863,000 (2020: 

US$355,384,000). The Group’s biological assets, which mainly comprised of latex and rubber trees, are 

fair valued by professional independent valuers engaged by the Group using industry/market accepted 

valuation methodology. Due to the measurement of fair value being inherently judgement and signiﬁ cance 

of the amount as at the year end, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

 

We had obtained the valuation of biological assets prepared by independent valuers engaged by the 

management. The fair value reports are reviewed by us together with our valuation specialists for 

appropriateness of the fair value methodology used and reasonableness of the assumptions used which 

include forecast cash ﬂ ows, discount rates and yield rates for the plantation and market prices of the latex 

and log. We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of the independent valuers and assessed 

the reasonableness of their conclusions having regard to the key assumptions mentioned above. We also 

evaluated the key assumptions such as yield rates for the plantation by comparing these assumptions 

to historical trends and assessed the reasonableness of the market price of the latex and log used by 

comparing these against available external market data.

 

We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in relation to biological assets included in Note 16 

to the ﬁ nancial statements.

3. 

Expected credit loss for loan to a third party

 

During the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2021, the Group recognised an allowance of expected credit 

losses (“ECL”) amounted to US$1,440,000 (2020: Nil) for loan to the third party. As at 31 December 2021, 

the carrying amount of the loan to the third party amounted to US$60,080,000 (2020: US$61,843,000). This 

amount represents 8% of the Group’s net assets.

 

This area was signiﬁ cant to our audit because the assessment of allowance of ECL involves management 

exercising signiﬁ cant judgement to determine when there is signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk associated 

with the loan and making assumptions about the fair value of the underlying collaterals, and the inputs to 

the estimation of expected credit loss. Accordingly, we determined this as a key audit matter. 

 

Management has assessed that there was signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk due to the overdue interest 

payment which has not been settled by the borrower as at 31 December 2021. The Group has assessed the 

ECL based on the value of the collaterals and the discounted cash inﬂ ow from the borrower for the loan 

repayment. 

 

The Group engaged an independent valuer to determine the fair value of one of the collaterals which 

comprise of the equity interest held by the borrower in its subsidiary. Given that the subsidiary of the 

borrower comprises diﬀ erent equity stakes in multiple entities, the fair value of this collateral was 

determined by the independent valuer using Sum-of-the-Parts (“SOTP”) method, based on the underlying 

ﬁ nancial projections, including but not limited to the projected revenue and proﬁ tability relating to 

that borrower’s subsidiary. With regards to the estimation of expected cash inﬂ ows from the borrower, 

management estimates the amount and the timing of recoveries.

 

For the collaterals held by the Group, we inspected legal agreements and supporting documentation to 

conﬁ rm the existence and the Group’s legal right to the collaterals. In assessing the collateral valuation on 

the equity interest held by the borrower in its subsidiary, we reviewed the independent valuation report 

and assessed the expertise, objectivity and competence of the independent valuer engaged by the Group. 

We involved our valuation specialist to review the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies and 

certain assumptions used by the independent valuer in determining the fair value of the collateral. For 

the discounted cash inﬂ ows, we reviewed the management’s forecast of recoverable cash ﬂ ows, including 

the basis for the amounts and timing of recoveries. We checked the underlying data to ensure accuracy by 

agreeing to source documents such as loan agreements. We considered and corroborated the borrower’s 

latest developments through adverse news search and/or publicly available information, where applicable.

 

We also reviewed the adequacy of the note disclosures in relation to the allowance of ECL. The Group’s 

disclosures on loan to a third party and its corresponding ECL are in Note 20 to the ﬁ nancial statements.

Other information

Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in 

the annual report, but does not include the ﬁ nancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁ nancial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 

performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 

that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of management and directors for the ﬁ nancial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in 

accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal 

accounting controls suﬃ  cient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss 

from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as 

necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair ﬁ nancial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 

accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic 

alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s ﬁ nancial reporting process.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 

opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 

accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 

fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 

to inﬂ uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁ nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 

skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud 

or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 

that is suﬃ  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 

are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eﬀ ectiveness 

of the Group’s internal control.

 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 

and related disclosures made by management.

 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 

that may cast signiﬁ cant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 

a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 

disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 

future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 

disclosures, and whether the ﬁ nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

 

Obtain suﬃ  cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁ nancial information of the entities or business 

activities within the Group to express an opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements. We are responsible for the 

direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 

opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 

and signiﬁ cant audit ﬁ ndings, including any signiﬁ cant deﬁ ciencies in internal control that we identify during our 

audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably 

be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most signiﬁ cance in 

the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 

matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 

our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 

interest beneﬁ ts of such communication.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those 

subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in 

accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Yee Woon Yim.

2.3 

Basis of consolidation and business combinations

 

(a) 

Basis of consolidation

 

 

The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements comprise the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and its 

subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period. The ﬁ nancial statements of the subsidiaries used 

in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are prepared for the same reporting date 

as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar 

circumstances.

 

 

All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-

group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

 

 

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group 

obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

 

 

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a 

deﬁ cit balance.

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.3 

Basis of consolidation and business combinations (cont’d)

 

(a) 

Basis of consolidation (cont’d)

 

 

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an 

equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

 

 

- 

derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying 

amounts at the date when control is lost;

 

 

- 

derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;

 

 

- 

derecognises the cumulative translation diﬀ erences recorded in equity;

 

 

- 

recognises the fair value of the consideration received;

 

 

- 

recognises the fair value of any investment retained;

 

 

- 

recognises any surplus or deﬁ cit in proﬁ t or loss;

 

 

- 

re-classiﬁ es the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive 

income to proﬁ t or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.

 

(b) 

Business combinations and goodwill

 

 

Where a business combination involves entities or businesses under common control, it is outside 

the scope of SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations and may be accounted for using the pooling of 

interest method or the acquisition method. Acquisition method is applied when the transaction has 

substance from the perspective of the Group in accordance with SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations.

 

 

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identiﬁ able assets 

acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 

at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which 

the costs are incurred and the services are received.

 

 

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value 

at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 

which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-39 

Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement either in proﬁ t or loss or as a change to other 

comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classiﬁ ed as equity, it is not remeasured 

until it is ﬁ nally settled within equity.

 

 

The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non-controlling interest in the 

acquiree (if any), that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate 

share of net assets in the event of liquidation, is recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or 

at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identiﬁ able net assets. Other 

components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless 

another measurement basis is required by another SFRS(I).

 

 

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, 

the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree’s 

identiﬁ able assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out 

in Note 2.11(a). In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised 

as gain on bargain purchase in proﬁ t or loss on the acquisition date.

2. 

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.4 

Transactions with non-controlling interests

 

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to 

owners of the Company.

 

When the proportion of equity held by the NCI changes and the parent retains control of the subsidiary, 

the carrying amount originally recognised in NCI is adjusted to reﬂ ect the changes in the relative interests 

in the subsidiary.

 

Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are 

accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and 

non-controlling interests are adjusted to reﬂ ect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any 

diﬀ erence between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the 

consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

2.5 

Subsidiaries

 

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is 

exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to 

aﬀ ect those returns through its power over the investee.

 

In the Company’s separate ﬁ nancial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less 

impairment losses.

 

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it shall:

 

(a) 

derecognise:

 

 

(i) 

the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at 

the date when control is lost; and 

 

 

(ii) 

the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the former subsidiary at the date 

when control is lost (including any components of other comprehensive income attributable 

to them).

 

(b) 

recognise:

 

 

(i) 

the fair value of the consideration received, if any, from the transaction, event or 

circumstances that resulted in the loss of the control;

 

 

(ii) 

if the transaction, event or circumstances that resulted in the loss of control involves 

a distribution of shares of the subsidiary to owners in their capacity as owners, that 

distribution; and

 

 

(iii) 

any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is 

lost.

2.6 

Associates

 

An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the ﬁ nancial and operating 

policy decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.

 

The Group accounts for its investments in associates using the equity method from the date on which it 

becomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over 

the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identiﬁ able assets and liabilities is accounted as 

goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the 

net fair value of the investee’s identiﬁ able assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included 

as income in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate’s proﬁ t or loss in the period in which 

the investment is acquired.

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.6 

Associates (cont’d)

 

Under the equity method, the investment in associates is carried in the statement of ﬁ nancial position 

at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates. The proﬁ t or 

loss reﬂ ects the share of results of the operations of the associate. Distributions received from associates 

reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been a change recognised in other 

comprehensive income by the associates, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other 

comprehensive income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and 

associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates.

 

When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group 

does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the 

associate.

 

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 

additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in associate. The Group determines at the end 

of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is 

impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the diﬀ erence between the 

recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in proﬁ t or loss.

 

The ﬁ nancial statements of the associates are prepared as the same reporting date as the Company. 

Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

2.7 

Foreign currency

 

The ﬁ nancial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“USD”), which is also the Company’s 

functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in 

the ﬁ nancial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

 

(a) 

Transactions and balances

 

 

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the 

Company and its subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at 

exchange rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities 

denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling as at the statement 

of ﬁ nancial position date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 

foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. 

 

 

Exchange diﬀ erences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items 

at the end of the reporting period are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

 

(b) 

Consolidated ﬁ nancial statements

 

 

For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into USD 

at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of ﬁ nancial position date and their proﬁ t or loss are 

translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange diﬀ erences 

arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign 

operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign 

operation is recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

2.8 

Property, plant and equipment

 

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, 

property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 

impairment losses. The cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and 

borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying 

property, plant and equipment. The accounting policy for borrowing costs is set out in Note 2.18. The cost 

of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that 

future economic beneﬁ ts associated with the item will ﬂ ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 

measured reliably.

2.  

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.8 

Property, plant and equipment (cont’d)

 

When signiﬁ cant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group 

recognises such parts as individual assets with speciﬁ c useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, 

when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and 

equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisﬁ ed. All other repair and maintenance costs 

are recognised in proﬁ t or loss as incurred.

 

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Leasehold improvements and renovation

–

10 years

Oﬃ  ce equipment

–

2 years

Computers and software

–

1 to 10 years

Leasehold buildings

–

20 years

Plant and machinery

–

10 years

Vehicles

–

4 to 10 years

Leasehold land

–

20 to 95 years

 

Freehold land is not depreciated. 

 

Assets under construction included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets 

are not yet available for use.

 

Plantation establishment costs, consisting of costs directly incurred during the period of plantation 

development, are not depreciated. The establishment costs will be transferred to plantation assets and will 

be subject to depreciation upon commencement of rubber tapping activities. 

 

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes 

in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

 

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each ﬁ nancial year-end, and 

adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

 

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 

beneﬁ ts are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in 

proﬁ t or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

2.9 

Land use rights

 

Certain plantation lands in Cameroon were given land use rights by the State of Cameroon in 1996 for a 

period of 50 years plus 50 years, renewable at a nominal value to the Group. With the Group’s continuing 

investment in replanting and extension on the plantation land, the Group is of the view that it is not likely 

that the land use rights will not be renewed at the expiring of its current term. The land use rights is 

depreciated over its remaining useful life of 76 years.

2.10 Investment properties

 

Investment properties are properties that are owned by the Group that are held to earn rentals or for 

capital appreciation, or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for 

administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. Investment properties comprise completed 

investment properties and properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment 

properties. Properties held under operating leases are classiﬁ ed as investment properties when the 

deﬁ nition of an investment property is met.

 

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.

 

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising 

from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in proﬁ t or loss in the year in which 

they arise.

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.10 Investment properties (cont’d)

 

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment 

property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic beneﬁ t is expected from its disposal. 

Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in proﬁ t or loss 

in the year of retirement or disposal.

2.11 Intangible assets

 

(a) 

Goodwill

 

 

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 

any accumulated impairment losses.

 

 

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the 

acquisition date, allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to beneﬁ t from the 

synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 

assigned to those units.

 

 

The cash-generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairment annually 

and whenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is 

determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group 

of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-

generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in proﬁ t or loss. 

Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

 

 

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that cash-

generating unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included 

in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 

operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of 

the operations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

 

(b) 

Other intangible assets

 

 

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets 

acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following 

initial acquisition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 

any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised 

development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reﬂ ected in proﬁ t or loss in the year in 

which the expenditure is incurred.

 

 

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either ﬁ nite or indeﬁ nite.

 

 

Intangible assets with ﬁ nite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed 

for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 

amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each ﬁ nancial year-end. 

Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic 

beneﬁ ts embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as 

appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

 

 

Intangible assets with indeﬁ nite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment 

annually, or more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 

be impaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not 

amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indeﬁ nite useful life is reviewed annually 

to determine whether the useful life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in 

useful life from indeﬁ nite to ﬁ nite is made on a prospective basis.

2.  

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.11 Intangible assets (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Other intangible assets (cont’d)

 

 

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the diﬀ erence 

between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in 

proﬁ t or loss when the asset is derecognised.

 

 

(i) 

Process know-how

 

 

 

The useful life of the process know-how was estimated to be indeﬁ nite because based on the 

current demand for rubber, management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period 

over which the process know-how are expected to generate net cash inﬂ ows for the Group.

 

 

(ii) 

Customer relationship

 

 

 

Customer relationship acquired was initially recognised at cost and was subsequently carried 

at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These costs are 

amortised to the income statement using the straight line method over 10 years.

 

 

(iii) 

Computer software

 

 

 

Acquired computer software licences are initially capitalised at cost and was subsequently 

carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These 

costs are amortised to the income statement using the straight line method over 5 years. 

2.12 Bearer plants and biological assets

 

The classiﬁ cation of rubber trees as bearer plant or non-bearer plant depends on the business plan for 

respective rubber plantations, pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the trees, plantation and 

relevant market or industry considerations. Rubber trees are not considered bearer plant when there is 

commercially viable plan to convert the rubber trees into products other than incidental scrap at the end of 

the rubber production life to an established market.  

 

Bearer plants consist of the oil palm trees in the Malaysian plantation and rubber trees in Ivory Coast 

plantation. Cultivation of seedlings is stated at cost. The accumulated cost will be classiﬁ ed as immature 

plantations at the time of planting. Mature plantations are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 

and impairment. The Group concluded that depreciating the mature plantations by the expected yield 

pattern of the bearer plants over their useful lives, estimated at 30 years, is more reﬂ ective of the pattern 

in which the assets’ future beneﬁ t are expected to be consumed. The carrying value of bearer plants are 

reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 

not be recoverable. A bearer plant is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁ ts are 

expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the bearer plant is included 

in the proﬁ t or loss when the bearer plant is derecognised. 

 

Biological assets consist of rubber latex and rubber trees in the Malaysian and Cameroonian plantations, 

produce that grow on oil palm trees in the Malaysian plantations and rubber latex in Ivory Coast plantation. 

These are measured at fair value less estimate costs to sell. Gains or losses arising on initial recognition of 

plantations at fair value less estimated costs to sell and from the changes in fair value less estimated costs 

to sell of plantations at each reporting date are included in proﬁ t or loss for the period in which they arise.

 

The Group has assessed that there is an established commercial market for end-of-life rubber trees in 

Malaysia and Cameroon, and it is the Group’s business plan to dispose the end-of-life rubber trees as an 

agricultural produce for more than an incidental scrap. As such, the classiﬁ cation of rubber plantations in 

Malaysia and Cameroon remains the same as preceding year.

 

Further details are disclosed in Note 3.1(a).

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.13 Impairment of non-ﬁ nancial assets

 

The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 

If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an 

estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.

 

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs 

of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 

generate cash inﬂ ows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where 

the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 

considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 

 

The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are 

prepared separately for each of the Group’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are 

allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of ﬁ ve years. For longer 

periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash ﬂ ows after the ﬁ fth year.

 

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

 

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any 

indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If 

such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A 

previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used 

to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the 

case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed 

the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 

recognised previously. 

2.14 Financial instruments

 

(a) 

Financial assets

 

 

Initial recognition and measurement

 

 

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual 

provisions of the ﬁ nancial instrument. The Group determines the classiﬁ cation of its ﬁ nancial assets 

at initial recognition.

 

 

When ﬁ nancial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case 

of ﬁ nancial assets not at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. 

Transaction costs of ﬁ nancial assets carried at fair value through proﬁ t or loss are expensed in proﬁ t 

or loss. 

 

 

Trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be 

entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts 

collected on behalf of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancing 

component at initial recognition. 

 

 

Subsequent measurement

 

 

Debt instrument

 

 

(i) 

Amortised cost

 

 

 

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash ﬂ ows where those cash ﬂ ows 

represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial 

assets are measured at amortised cost using the eﬀ ective interest method, less impairment. 

Gains and losses are recognised in proﬁ t or loss when the assets are derecognised or 

impaired, and through the amortisation process.

2.14 Financial instruments (cont’d)

 

(a) 

Financial assets (cont’d)

 

 

(ii) 

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

 

 

 

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash ﬂ ows and for selling the 

ﬁ nancial assets, where the assets’ cash ﬂ ows represent solely payments of principal and 

interest, are measured at FVOCI. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are subsequently 

measured at fair value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of the ﬁ nancial assets 

are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign 

exchange gains and losses and interest calculated using the effective interest method 

are recognised in proﬁ t or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 

comprehensive income is reclassiﬁ ed from equity to proﬁ t or loss as a reclassiﬁ cation 

adjustment when the ﬁ nancial asset is derecognised. 

 

 

(iii)  

Fair value through proﬁ t or loss

 

 

 

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value 

through proﬁ t or loss. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured 

at fair value through proﬁ t or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in 

proﬁ t or loss in the period in which it arises. 

 

 

 

Investments in equity instruments

 

 

 

On initial recognition of an investment in equity instrument that is not held for trading, the 

Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. Dividends 

from such investments are to be recognised in proﬁ t or loss when the Group’s right to 

receive payments is established. For investments in equity instruments which the Group 

has not elected to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI, changes in fair value are 

recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

 

 

 

Derivatives

 

 

 

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date of derivative contract is entered 

into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. 

Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.  

 

 

 

Derecognition

 

 

 

A ﬁ nancial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash ﬂ ows from the 

asset has expired. On derecognition of a ﬁ nancial asset in its entirety, the diﬀ erence between 

the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or 

loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

 

(b) 

Financial liabilities

 

 

Initial recognition and measurement

 

 

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the 

contractual provisions of the ﬁ nancial instrument. The Group determines the classiﬁ cation of its 

ﬁ nancial liabilities at initial recognition.

 

 

All ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of ﬁ nancial liabilities not at 

fair value through proﬁ t or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial liabilities (cont’d)

 

 

Subsequent measurement

 

 

After initial recognition, ﬁ nancial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through proﬁ t or loss 

are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eﬀ ective interest method. Gains and losses 

are recognised in proﬁ t or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation 

process. 

 

 

Derecognition

 

 

A ﬁ nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled 

or expired. When an existing ﬁ nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 

substantially diﬀ erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modiﬁ ed, such an 

exchange or modiﬁ cation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of 

a new liability, and the diﬀ erence in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

 

(c) 

Gain/loss on commodity contracts

 

 

Commodity contracts to buy and sell natural rubber commodities can be subject to net settlement 

if market conditions are favourable. Such commodity contracts and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments 

are marked to market at market rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Unrealised 

gains or losses are taken to proﬁ t or loss. Market value is generally based on listed market prices. 

If listed market prices are not available, market value is determined based on relevant factors, 

including trade price quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the commodities and 

price quotations for similar commodities traded in diﬀ erent markets, including markets located in 

diﬀ erent geographical areas.

2.15 Impairment of ﬁ nancial assets

 

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at 

fair value through proﬁ t or loss. ECLs are based on the diﬀ erence between the contractual cash ﬂ ows due 

in accordance with the contract and all the cash ﬂ ows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an 

approximation of the original eﬀ ective interest rate. The expected cash ﬂ ows will include cash ﬂ ows from 

the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. 

 

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a signiﬁ cant increase 

in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that resulted from default events 

that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12 month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there 

has been a signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for 

credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposures, irrespective of timing of the default (an 

ECL). 

 

For trade receivables, the Group applies a simpliﬁ ed approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group 

does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on ECLs at each 

reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss 

experience, adjusted for forward looking factors speciﬁ c to the debtors and the economic environment. 

 

For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simpliﬁ cation. At every 

reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk 

using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or eﬀ ort. In making 

that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the 

Group considers that there has been a signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk when the contractual payments are 

more than 90 days past due. 

2.  

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.15 Impairment of ﬁ nancial assets (cont’d)

 

The Group considers a ﬁ nancial asset in default when contractual payments are 365 days past due. 

However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a ﬁ nancial asset to be in default when internal and 

external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in 

full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A ﬁ nancial asset is written oﬀ 

when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash ﬂ ows. 

2.16 Cash and cash equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short term deposits that are readily 

convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value.

2.17 Inventories

 

Inventories except consumables are carried at the fair market value at the end of each reporting period, 

whereby the resulting unrealised gain or loss is recognised in proﬁ t or loss. This is an alternative policy 

allowed by SFRS(I) 1-2 Inventories for commodity broker or trader, as this better reﬂ ects the performance 

of the Group. The Group’s operating activities, including procurement of raw materials, selling of ﬁ nished 

goods and entering into forward commodity (natural rubber) contracts are subject to movements in the 

market prices of natural rubber. The Group has two main types of sales contracts and purchase contracts; 

long term contracts (“LTCs”) and spot contracts (“Spot”). The prices for LTCs are usually determined based 

on the average market price preceding the delivery months, whereas the prices for Spot contracts are 

usually agreed on the day the Spot contracts are entered. In addition to the management of the price 

risk between the sales and purchase activities, which is the key driver and contributor to the Group’s 

proﬁ tability, the Group also provided other ancillary services such as processing and distribution. The proﬁ t 

for these ancillary services is recognised in the proﬁ t or loss only when these services are performed by the 

Group.

 

Consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted 

average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 

completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

2.18 Borrowing costs

 

Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable 

to the acquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences 

when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures 

and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially 

completed for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 

of funds.

2.19 Provisions

 

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 

past event, it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts will be required to 

settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.

 

Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reﬂ ect the current best 

estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts will be 

required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the eﬀ ect of the time value of money is 

material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects, where appropriate, the risks 

speciﬁ c to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 

recognised as a ﬁ nance cost.

2.20 Employee beneﬁ ts

 

(a) 

Retirement beneﬁ t costs

 

 

Payments to deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁ t plans are charged as an expense when 

employees have rendered the services entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-

managed retirement beneﬁ t schemes, such as the Singapore Central Provident Fund, are dealt 

with as payments to deﬁ ned contribution plans where the group’s obligations under the plans are 

equivalent to those arising in a deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁ t plan.

 

 

For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t retirement beneﬁ t plans, the cost of providing beneﬁ ts is determined using 

the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each 

reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the eﬀ ect of the changes 

to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reﬂ ected 

immediately in the statement of ﬁ nancial position with a charge or credit recognised in other 

comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other 

comprehensive income is reﬂ ected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassiﬁ ed to 

proﬁ t or loss. Service costs which include current service cost, past service cost and gains or losses 

on non-routine settlement are recognised as expense in proﬁ t or loss. Net interest is calculated by 

applying the discount rate based on high quality long term bonds at the beginning of the period to 

the net deﬁ ned beneﬁ t liability or asset. Net interest on the net deﬁ ned beneﬁ t liability or asset is 

recognised as expense or income in proﬁ t or loss.

 

 

Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t costs are categorised as follows:

 

 

 

Service cost;

 

 

 

Net interest expense or income of the net retirement beneﬁ t obligation; and

 

 

 

Re-measurements of net retirement beneﬁ t obligation

 

 

The Group presents the ﬁ rst two components of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t costs in proﬁ t or loss in the line 

item ‘Employee beneﬁ t expense’. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service 

costs.

 

 

The retirement beneﬁ t obligation recognised in the statement of ﬁ nancial position represents 

the actual deﬁ cit or surplus in the group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans. Any surplus resulting from this 

calculation is limited to the present value of any economic beneﬁ ts available in the form of refunds 

from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

 

 

A liability for a termination beneﬁ t is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer 

withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related 

restructuring costs.

 

 

(b) 

Employee leave entitlement

 

 

Employees’ entitlement to annual leave is recognised as a liability when they are accrued to the 

employees. The undiscounted liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months 

after the end of the reporting period is recognised for services rendered by employees up to the end 

of the reporting period.

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.21 Leases

 

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the 

contract conveys the right to control the use of an identiﬁ ed asset for a period of time in exchange for 

consideration.

 

Group as a lessee

 

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term 

leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and 

right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

 

(i) 

Right-of-use assets

 

 

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 

underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 

depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The 

cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs 

incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 

received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease 

term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.

 

 

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost 

reﬂ ects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life 

of the asset.

 

 

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.13.

 

(ii) 

Lease liabilities

 

 

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the 

present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include ﬁ xed 

payments (including in substance ﬁ xed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease 

payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value 

guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably 

certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the 

lease term reﬂ ects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do 

not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 

inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

 

 

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing 

rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily 

determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reﬂ ect 

the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount 

of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modiﬁ cation, a change in the lease term, a change in 

the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate 

used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the 

underlying asset.

 

(iii) 

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

 

 

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of 

machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 

commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value 

assets recognition exemption to leases of oﬃ  ce equipment that are considered to be low value. 

Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a 

straight-line basis over the lease term.

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.21 Leases (cont’d)

 

Group as a lessor

 

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 

of an asset are classiﬁ ed as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-

line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of proﬁ t or loss due to its 

operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to 

the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental 

income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

2.22 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations

 

Non-current assets and disposal groups classiﬁ ed as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their 

carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁ ed as 

held-for-sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 

through continuing use. A component of the Group is classiﬁ ed as a ‘discontinued operation’ when the 

criteria to be classiﬁ ed as held-for-sale have been met or it has been disposed of and such a component 

represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single 

coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.

 

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classiﬁ ed as held-for-sale are not depreciated or 

amortised.

2.23 Revenue

 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange 

for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third 

parties. 

 

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisﬁ es a performance obligation by transferring promised 

goods or services to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A 

performance obligation may be satisﬁ ed at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised 

is the amount allocated to the satisﬁ ed performance obligation. 

 

(a) 

Sale of goods

 

 

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered to the customer and all criteria 

for acceptance have been satisﬁ ed. 

 

(b) 

Interest income

 

 

Interest income is recognised using the eﬀ ective interest method.

 

(c) 

Rental income

 

 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-

line basis over the lease terms. The aggregate costs of incentives provided to lessees are recognised 

as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

2. 

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.24 

Taxes

 

(a) 

Current income tax

 

 

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the 

amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax 

laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of 

the reporting period, in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

 

 

Current income taxes are recognised in proﬁ t or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to 

items recognised outside proﬁ t or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 

in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 

appropriate.

 

(b) 

Deferred tax

 

 

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary diﬀ erences at the end of the 

reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 

ﬁ nancial reporting purposes.

 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary diﬀ erences, except:

 

 

- 

When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or 

liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 

aﬀ ects neither the accounting proﬁ t nor taxable proﬁ t or loss; and

 

 

- 

In respect of taxable temporary diﬀ erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 

associates and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary 

diﬀ erences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary diﬀ erences will not 

reverse in the foreseeable future.

 

 

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary diﬀ erences, the carry forward of 

unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ t will be 

available against which the deductible temporary diﬀ erences, and the carry forward of unused tax 

credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:

 

 

- 

When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary diﬀ erence arises from the 

initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 

and, at the time of the transaction, aﬀ ects neither the accounting proﬁ t nor taxable proﬁ t or 

loss; and

 

 

- 

In respect of deductible temporary diﬀ erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 

associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 

extent that it is probable that the temporary diﬀ erences will reverse in the foreseeable future 

and taxable proﬁ t will be available against which the temporary diﬀ erences can be utilised.

 

 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period and reduced to the 

extent that it is no longer probable that suﬃ  cient taxable proﬁ t will be available to allow all or part 

of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end 

of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future 

taxable proﬁ t will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 

year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 

been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.24 Taxes (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Deferred tax (cont’d)

 

 

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside proﬁ t or loss is recognised outside proﬁ t or 

loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other 

comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is 

adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.

 

 

Tax beneﬁ ts acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate 

recognition at that date, would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and 

circumstances changed. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it 

does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in proﬁ t 

or loss. 

 

(c) 

Sales tax

 

 

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

 

 

- 

When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the 

taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition 

of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and

 

 

- 

When receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

 

 

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as 

part of other receivables or other payables in the statement of ﬁ nancial position. 

2.25 Share capital and share issuance expenses

 

Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity. Incremental costs 

directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital. 

 

Fair valuation of shares is based on the prevailing market price as at the date of issuance.

2.26 Perpetual securities

 

The perpetual securities do not have a maturity date and the Company is able to elect to defer any 

scheduled distribution perpetually subject to the terms and conditions of the securities issue. Accordingly, 

the Company is not considered to have a contractual obligation to make principal repayments or 

distributions in respect of its perpetual securities issue and the perpetual securities are presented within 

equity. Distributions are treated as dividends which will be directly debited from equity. Costs directly 

attributable to the issue of the perpetual securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue.

 

On the election of the Company to redeem the perpetual securities, the perpetual securities will be 

reclassiﬁ ed as a ﬁ nancial liability. The ﬁ nancial liability is initially recognised at fair value and any diﬀ erence 

between the carrying amount of the liability and the previously recognised equity instrument is recognised 

in equity.

 

No gain or loss is recognised in the proﬁ t or loss on the reclassiﬁ cation.

2.27 Contingencies

 

A contingent liability is:

 

(a) 

a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁ rmed only by the 

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control 

of the Group; or

2.  

Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.27 Contingencies (cont’d)

 

(b) 

a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

 

 

(i) 

it is not probable that an outﬂ ow of resources embodying economic beneﬁ ts will be required 

to settle the obligation; or 

 

 

(ii) 

the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with suﬃ  cient reliability.

 

 

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be 

conﬁ rmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not 

wholly within the control of the Group.

 

 

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the statement of ﬁ nancial position of the 

Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present 

obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined. 

2.28 Segment reporting

 

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their business units. 

Management regularly reviews the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to 

assess the segment performance. Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note 

35, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment 

information.

2.29 Government grant

 

Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and 

all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised 

as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to 

compensate,�are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts 

over the expected useful life of the related asset. 

 

When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal 

amounts and released to proﬁ t or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of 

consumption of the beneﬁ ts of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments.

3. 

 Signiﬁ cant accounting judgements and estimates

 

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make 

judgements, estimates and assumptions that aﬀ ect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets 

and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty 

about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the 

carrying amount of the asset or liability aﬀ ected in the future periods.

3.1 

Judgements made in applying accounting policies

 

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following 

judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on the amounts 

recognised in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements:

3.1 

Judgements made in applying accounting policies (cont’d)

 

(a) 

Classiﬁ cation of rubber trees as bearer plants or non-bearer plants

 

 

The Group has rubber plantations in Malaysia and Cameroon.

 

 

The classiﬁ cation of rubber trees as bearer plant or non-bearer plant depends on the business 

plan for respective rubber plantations, pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the trees, 

plantation and relevant market or industry considerations. Rubber trees are not considered bearer 

plant when there is commercially viable plan to sell the rubber trees as agricultural produce other 

than incidental scrap at the end of the rubber production life to an established market.  

 

 

The Group has assessed that there is an established commercial market for end-of-life rubber 

trees in Malaysia and Cameroon, and it is the Group’s business plan to convert the rubber trees 

into products other than incidental scrap at the end of the rubber production life. As such, the 

classiﬁ cation of rubber plantations in Malaysia and Cameroon remains the same as preceding year.

 

 

Further details are disclosed in Note 2.12.

 

(b) 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

 

 

Judgement has been made by the Group to identify the cash-generating units and assess the future 

market and economic assumptions, such as forecasted rubber price, forecasted sales volume, 

growth rate and pre-tax discount rates. The Group has estimated the recoverable amounts of cash-

generating units to which goodwill and process know-how has been allocated to, based on value-in-

use approach. Estimates used in deriving the value-in-use, are disclosed in Note 3.2(a). 

3.2 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

 

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of 

the reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 

available when the ﬁ nancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about 

future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the 

control of the Group. Such changes are reﬂ ected in the assumptions when they occur.

 

(a) 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

 

 

Determining whether goodwill and process know-how is impaired requires an estimation of the 

value in use of the cash-generating-unit to which the goodwill and process know-how have been 

allocated. 

 

 

The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows that is expected 

to arise, the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes and a suitable discount rate in order 

to calculate present value. The key assumptions applied in the determination of the value in use 

including a sensitivity analysis are disclosed and further explained in Note 11 to the ﬁ nancial 

statements. The Group’s carrying amount of goodwill and process know-how at 31 December 2021 

is US$296,379,000 (2020: US$296,379,000).

 

(b) 

Measurement of biological assets

 

 

The fair value of biological assets is estimated using the discounted cash ﬂ ow model (“DCF”) by 

independent professional valuers. This requires an estimate of the expected future cash ﬂ ows from 

the biological assets to be made and a suitable discount rate to be chosen, in order to calculate the 

present value of future cash ﬂ ows. The valuation of these biological assets is particularly sensitive to 

discount rates as disclosed in Note 36(d)(i).

(c) 

Recoverability of a loan to a third party (“borrower”)

 

 

The interest repayment from the borrower was overdue as at 31 December 2021 and this indicated 

a signiﬁ cant increase in the credit risk since the initial recognition of the ﬁ nancial assets. The 

Group has performed speciﬁ c credit risk assessment on the loan to the borrower to determine the 

expected credit losses (“ECL”). The Group changed the impairment loss allowance from 12-month 

ECL to lifetime ECL and provided an ECL of US$1,440,000 for the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 

2021. Further details of the assessment are disclosed in Note 20.

Impairment testing of goodwill and process know-how with indeﬁ nite life

 

The above goodwill and process know-how was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2021. No 

impairment loss was recognised as at 31 December 2021 as the recoverable amounts of the respective 

CGU to which goodwill and process know-how have been allocated to were in excess of their respective 

carrying values. The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined based on value in use 

calculations using ﬁ ve years cash ﬂ ow projections from ﬁ nancial budgets approved by management and 

assumed a terminal growth rate thereafter.

11. 

Intangible assets (cont’d)

 

The calculations of value in use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

 

Growth rates – The forecasted growth rates are based on published industry research and do not exceed 

the long term average growth rate for the industries relevant to the CGUs.

 

Pre-tax discount rates – Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks speciﬁ c to each 

CGU, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been 

incorporated in the cash ﬂ ow estimates. 

 

Rubber price – The forecasted rubber price is based on estimated rubber price published by an external 

industry report.

 

Gross proﬁ t per metric tonne – forecasted gross proﬁ t is based on estimated gross proﬁ t per metric tonne 

for the future years.

 

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions

 

Changes to the above assumptions used by management to determine the recoverable value can have 

signiﬁ cant impact on the results of the assessment. Management believes that no reasonably possible 

change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to materially 

exceed its recoverable amount.

 

For HRC Group, assuming that gross proﬁ t per metric tonne deviates from budget by 29%, there will be an 

impairment loss of US$4,000,000 to the goodwill.

Assets pledged as security

 

 

In addition to assets held under lease obligation, the Group has pledged certain property, plant and 

equipment with a carrying amount of US$60,654,000 (2020: US$47,067,000) to secure the Group’s 

and the Company’s loans and borrowings (Note 26).

 

(b) 

Right-of-use assets

 

 

The Group has lease contracts for land, oﬃ  ce, vehicles and other equipment used in its operations 

with predominantly ﬁ xed payments over the lease terms. Some of these leases have terms of 

renewal but no purchase options or escalation clauses. 

 

 

Leases of land and oﬃ  ce generally have lease terms between 1 and 90 years, machinery and other 

equipment generally have lease terms between 1 and 4 years. Generally, the Group is restricted

Investment in subsidiaries and associates (cont’d)

 

(a) 

Investment in subsidiaries (cont’d)

 

 

(i) 

Striking-oﬀ  a subsidiary

 

 

 

During the year, the Group struck oﬀ  its wholly-owned dormant subsidiary, JFL Agro Sdn. Bhd. 

The deregistration did not result in any proﬁ t or loss impact. 

 

 

(ii) 

Disposal of a subsidiary

 

 

 

In December 2021, the Group disposed its entire shareholding interest, representing 60% of 

the issued and paid-up share capital in Ivoirienne de Traitement du Caoutchouc S.A. (“ITCA”) 

for a total cash consideration of US$600,000 (the “Disposal”). 

 

 

 

The consideration was arrived at on a willing-seller and willing-buyer basis, taking into 

consideration of the ﬁ nancial position of ITCA. Following the Disposal, ITCA has ceased to be a 

subsidiary of the Group.

 

 

 

The Disposal did not have any material impact on the consolidated net tangible assets per 

share or earnings per share of the Group for the ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2021. 

 

 

 

As at date of disposal, ITCA owed various companies within the Group. These group of 

companies deem the recoverability of balance owed by ITCA is low, hence these balances 

had been written down in the respective companies’ accounts. The eﬀ ect of this write down 

has resulted to a transfer of US$4,755,000 from retained earnings to non-controlling interest, 

reﬂ ected in the Statements of changes in equity.

 

 

(iii) 

Deemed disposal of a subsidiary due to dilution of interest

 

 

 

In March 2021, a subsidiary of the Group, HeveaConnect Pte. Ltd. (“HeveaConnect”) issued 

35,162 new ordinary shares (“HC shares”) to a third party (“Investor”) for US$1,500,000 and 

the Company transferred 56,962 HC shares (the “Trust Shares”) into a trust managed and 

administered by an independent trustee. Trust Shares will be eventually distributed to eligible 

organisations involved in promoting the sustainability agenda in the natural rubber industry.

 

 

 

Subsequent to the issuance of new HC shares and transfer of the Trust Shares, the 

Company’s eﬀ ective shareholding in HeveaConnect has reduced from 71.09% to 49.91% and 

the Group no longer has control over majority of the HeveaConnect’s board. Accordingly, 

HeveaConnect ceased to be a subsidiary and it has been equity-accounted for as an associate.

 

 

 

As part of the initial recognition of investment in associate, the Group has engaged an 

independent valuer to carry out a purchase price allocation review (“PPA”). Based on the 

PPA exercise, the Group concluded that the investment amount includes US$2,039,000 of 

intangible assets and US$5,123,000 of goodwill, classiﬁ ed as interest in associates as of the 

date of initial recognition.

The Group’s biological assets mainly consist of rubber trees in Malaysia and Cameroonian plantations and 

produce that grows on oil palm trees in Malaysia plantation, all of which are grown for commercial sales as 

part of normal business operations.

 

In February 2018, the government has granted a provisional concession land (13,731 hectare) to Sud 

Cameroun Hevea S.A., a non-wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. As the Group has adopted a zero 

deforestation policy in 2018, Sudcam has decided to return the concession land to the government in 

February 2021. This has resulted the land area to reduce from 58,929 hectares to 45,198 hectares. There is 

no material impact to the Group as the land was undeveloped.

 

In December 2021, Tropical Rubber Cote D’ivoire S.A. (“TRCI”), a subsidiary of the Group has successfully 

applied for and converted its 206 hectares of land use rights to freehold land titles (Arrete de Concession 

Deﬁ nitive). TRCI has entered into various sale and purchase agreements for the disposal of an aggregate of 

54.5 hectares of plantation land. As at 31 December 2021, TRCI has disposed 3 hectares of freehold land 

for a consideration of US$1,500,000 and a gain on disposal of US$938,000 has been recognised in proﬁ t or 

loss (Note 5). The disposal of the remaining 51.5 hectares is further disclosed in Note 39.

 

Interest expense amounting to US$9,312,000 was capitalised in 2021 (2020: US$10,040,000). The rate used 

to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 1.84% - 7.15% (2020: 2.77% - 

7.15%) per annum, which is the eﬀ ective interest rate of borrowings.

 

A review of the recoverable amount for the plantation in Cameroon was determined based on the value in 

use calculation and the discount rate used is 13.0% (2020: 13.0%) per annum.

Debt instrument

 

In 2020, a subsidiary of the Group and a third party entered into an agreement to convert US$3,000,000 

of outstanding trade receivables from the third party into an investment of 3,000 Non-voting Class A 

Preferred Stock of the third party. The Group classiﬁ ed the 3,000 Non-voting Class A Preferred Stock as 

non-current debt instrument at amortised cost of US$3,000,000 and recognised a fair value adjustment of 

negative US$287,000 in proﬁ t or loss.

 

As part of the investment arrangement, the Group is entitled to an annual dividend of 5.5%. The third party 

may redeem Class A preferred stock at any time before November 2023, where the redemption becomes 

mandatory. During the year, the Group received interest income of US$165,000 related to the 5.5% annual 

dividend from the Counterparty.

Loans and other receivables (cont’d)

 

The loan to non-controlling interests of a subsidiary is secured, repayable in 2025 and earns interest at 5% 

per annum (2020: 5%).

 

The loan to a third party (“borrower”) was secured by the following:

 

(i) 

borrower’s equity interest in its subsidiary

 

(ii) 

borrower’s receivables and bank balances

 

(iii) 

certain borrower’s investment properties

 

In 2020, the loan to the borrower was structured with progressive payments for a period up to 31 

December 2024 which bears an interest at 10%-11% per annum and to be repaid semi-annually.

 

The interest repayment of US$4,471,000 was due on 31 December 2021. The borrower has been requested 

to repay 50% of the overdue amount by 31 March 2022, with the remaining 50% to be repaid by 30 June 

2022. As at the date of this report, this overdue interest remains unpaid and the discussion with the 

borrower is still ongoing, which we expect the discussion on the collection of overdue interest to be 

substantially completed on or before 30 June 2022.

 

The Group has assessed the collateral value to be suﬃ  cient to cover the carrying amount of the loan 

receivables based on the valuation performed by an independent professional valuer.

 

The Group has assessed the expected credit losses (“ECL”) for the loan to the borrower based on the 

following approaches:

 

(i) 

Discounted cash ﬂ ow

 

 

The ECL is estimated based on the present value of cash shortfalls between the contractual cash 

ﬂ ows that are due to the Group and the cash ﬂ ows that the Group expects to receive, by taking into 

account the timing of repayments and assuming that the Group continues to charge interest on the 

outstanding loan.

 

(ii) 

Lifetime ECL

 

 

The ECL is estimated based on the formula: Probability of default x Loss given default x Exposure of 

default.

 

Based on the assessment above, the Group has recognised a provision of ECL amounting to US$1,440,000 

for the ﬁ nancial year ended 2021 (2020: Nil). The ECL is sensitive to the timing of repayments.

 

Included in the loans and other receivables is an interest-bearing receivable of US$4,400,000. A subsidiary 

of the Group entered into a contractual agreement with a third party which bears an interest of 4.2% per 

annum and due within a year.

 

Included within other receivables are corporate social responsibility receivable (“CSR receivable”) 

amounting to US$8,479,000 (2020: US$9,043,000) and interest receivables amounting to US$7,674,000 

(2020: US$6,948,000). CSR receivable relates to receivable from a local government of a country where 

the Group’s subsidiaries operate in. The receivable arose from the costs incurred by the Group in building 

community for its workforce, such as: costs incurred in building hospital or school, which is co-funded by 

the local government.

 

Included within deposits is a deposit amounting to US$3,501,000 which was placed with a local government 

of a country where the Group’s subsidiary operate in to contest in court for tax assessments of prior years. 

The court has ruled in the Group’s favour in the Group’s contest for these tax assessments and ordered the 

local government to refund the deposit. As such, the Group has reversed the allowance for the deposit of 

US$3,156,000 during the year.

 

The Group had assessed the recoverability of other tax receivables which relates to value-added tax 

receivables from certain local governments of countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate in. As at 

31 December 2021, the allowance provided for other tax receivables amounted to US$3,308,000 (2020: 

US$4,053,000).

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding other assumptions 

constant. Changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the 

retirement beneﬁ t obligations to signiﬁ cant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the 

retirement beneﬁ t obligations calculated with the Projected Unit Credit method at the end of the reporting 

period) has been applied as when calculating the retirement beneﬁ t obligations recognised within the 

statement of ﬁ nancial position.

 

Through its retirement beneﬁ t pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most 

signiﬁ cant of which are detailed as below:

 

Changes in bond yields

 

A decrease in government bond yield will increase plan liabilities.

 

Inﬂ ation risk

 

The majority of the plan’s beneﬁ t obligations are linked to inﬂ ation which higher inﬂ ation will lead to higher 

liabilities.

 

The weighted average duration of the retirement beneﬁ ts obligation is 18.0 years (2020: 16.8 years).

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the Company. 

The ordinary shares of the Company have no par value.

29. 

Perpetual securities

 

In 2020, the Company issued guaranteed subordinated perpetual securities with principal amount of 

US$200,000,000 bearing distribution rate of 3.80% per annum. In the event of non-redemption by the 

Company in November 2025, the distribution rate will be reset and every ﬁ ve calendar years thereafter to 

a distribution rate equivalent to the sum of (a) the initial spread of 3.345%, (b) the then-prevailing ﬁ ve-year 

U.S. treasury rate and (c) a margin of 3.00% per annum. The perpetual securities were unconditionally and 

irrevocably guaranteed by Sinochem International Corporation, the major shareholder of the Company. An 

amount of US$192,640,000 net of issuance costs and guarantee fees, was recognised in equity.

 

The perpetual securities bear distributions which are payable semi-annually. Subject to the relevant terms 

and conditions of the perpetual securities, the Company may elect to defer any scheduled distribution 

perpetually on the perpetual securities and is not subject to any limits as to the number of times a 

distribution can be deferred.

 

The perpetual securities are classiﬁ ed as equity and distributions are treated as dividends. This is on the 

basis that the Company has no contractual obligations to repay its principal or to pay any distributions. 

As a result, the instrument does not meet the deﬁ nition as a ﬁ nancial liability under SFRS(I) 1-32 Financial 

Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.

30. 

Other reserves

 

a) 

Capital reserve

 

 

Capital reserve also includes funds arising from the Group’s People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) 

subsidiaries which are required to transfer 10% of the net income to the reserve fund in accordance 

with PRC Articles of Association.

 

b) 

Other reserves

 

 

Other reserves mainly pertain to transaction cost on the issuance of perpetual securities and the 

excess of capital paid by a shareholder for the shares in the subsidiary over the capital received 

from the same shareholder.

 

c) 

Foreign currency translation reserve

 

 

The foreign currency translation reserve represents exchange differences arising from the 

translation of the ﬁ nancial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are 

diﬀ erent from that of the Group’s presentation currency.

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives

 

 

The Group and the Company is exposed to ﬁ nancial risks arising from its operations and the use of 

ﬁ nancial instruments. The key ﬁ nancial risks include foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit 

risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk. The Group has documented ﬁ nancial risk management 

policies. These policies set out the Group’s overall business strategies and its risk management 

philosophy. The Group’s overall ﬁ nancial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential 

adverse eﬀ ects on the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group.

 

 

The Group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for speculative purposes.

 

 

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these ﬁ nancial risks or the manner in which it 

manages and measures the risk.

 

 

(i) 

Foreign currency risk

 

 

 

As disclosed in Note 2.7 of the ﬁ nancial statements, the functional currency of the Company is 

the United States Dollar.

 

 

 

The Group faces foreign exchange risk as its borrowings, export sales and the costs of certain 

purchases are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of 

the Group entities, primarily Singapore Dollar, Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, 

Chinese Yuan Renminbi, CFA Franc and Thai Baht. The Group also holds cash and short-term 

deposits denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes.

 

 

 

The Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency 

exposure for some of its receivables.

 

 

 

Foreign currency sensitivity

 

 

 

The following table details the sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the relevant 

foreign currencies against the functional currency of each Group entity. 5% is the sensitivity 

rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 

represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange 

rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated 

monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign 

currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign 

operations within the Group where they gave rise to an impact on the Group’s proﬁ t or loss 

and/or equity.

(1) It excludes the eﬀ ect of foreign currency exposure that has been materially hedged.

 

 

(ii) 

Interest rate risk

 

 

 

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂ ows of the Group’s and the 

Company’s ﬁ nancial instruments will ﬂ uctuate because of changes in market interest rates. 

The Group’s primary interest rate risk arises from its loan payables.

 

 

 

The Group’s exposures to interest rates are set out below.

 

 

 

Interest rate sensitivity

 

 

 

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest 

rates for non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated 

change taking place at the beginning of the ﬁ nancial year and held constant throughout the 

reporting period in the case of instruments that have ﬂ oating rates. A 50 basis point increase 

or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel 

and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

 

 

 

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held 

constant, the Group’s income for the ﬁ nancial year would decrease/increase by US$3,868,000 

(2020: decrease/increase by US$3,848,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s 

exposure to interest rates on its balance due to the banks and ﬁ nancial institutions, and 

certain loan receivables.

 

 

(iii) 

Credit risk

 

 

 

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations 

resulting in ﬁ nancial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing 

with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining suﬃ  cient collateral where appropriate, as a 

means of mitigating the risk of ﬁ nancial loss from defaults. The Group’s exposure and the 

credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of 

transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.

(iii) 

Credit risk (cont’d)

 

 

 

The Group does not have any signiﬁ cant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or 

any Group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Group deﬁ nes counterparties 

as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. The credit risk on liquid funds 

and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments is limited because the counterparties are creditworthy 

entities.

 

 

 

The maximum exposure to credit risk in the event that the counterparties fail to perform 

their obligations as at the end of the reporting period in relation to each class of recognised 

ﬁ nancial assets is the carrying amount of those assets as stated in the statement of ﬁ nancial 

position.

 

 

 

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether 

there has been a signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each 

reporting period.

 

 

 

The Group has determined the default event on a ﬁ nancial asset to be when the counterparty 

fails to make contractual payments, within 90 days of when they fall due, which are derived 

based on the Group’s historical information.

 

 

 

To assess whether there is signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of 

a default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of 

initial recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking 

information which includes the following indicators:

 

 

 

- 

Internal credit rating

 

 

 

- 

External credit rating

 

 

 

- 

Actual or expected signiﬁ cant adverse changes in business, ﬁ nancial or economic 

conditions that are expected to cause a signiﬁ cant change to the borrower’s ability to 

meet its obligation

 

 

 

- 

Actual or expected signiﬁ cant changes in the operating results of the borrower

 

 

 

- 

Signiﬁ cant increases in credit risk on other ﬁ nancial instruments of the same borrower

 

 

 

- 

Signiﬁ cant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the 

quality of third party guarantees or credit enhancements

 

 

 

- 

Signiﬁ cant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, 

including changes in the payment status of borrowers in the group and changes in the 

operating results of the borrower.

 

 

 

Regardless of the analysis above, a signiﬁ cant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is 

more than 90 days past due in making contractual payment.

33. 

Financial risks and management (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont’d)

 

 

(iii) 

Credit risk (cont’d)

 

 

 

The Group determined that its ﬁ nancial assets are credit-impaired when:

 

 

 

- 

There is signiﬁ cant diﬃ  culty of the issuer or the borrower

 

 

 

- 

A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event

 

 

 

- 

It is becoming probably that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other ﬁ nancial 

reorganisation

 

 

 

- 

There is disappearance of an active market for the ﬁ nancial asset because of ﬁ nancial 

diﬃ  culty

 

 

 

The Group categorises a loan or receivable for potential write-oﬀ  when a debtor fails to 

make contractual payments more than 365 days past due. Financial assets are written oﬀ 

when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in 

repayment plan with the Group. Where loans and receivables have been written oﬀ , the 

Group continues to engage enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. 

Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in proﬁ t or loss.

 

 

 

The following are credit risk management practices and qualitative information about amount 

arising from expected credit losses for each class of ﬁ nancial assets.

 

 

 

(A) 

Trade receivables

 

 

 

 

The Group provides for expected credit losses (“ECL”) for all trade receivables using a 

provision matrix. The provision rates are determined based on the Group’s historical 

observed default rates analyse in accordance to days past due by grouping of 

customers which are:

 

 

 

 

- 

HRC Group

 

 

 

 

- 

Corrie MacColl Group

 

 

 

(B) 

Other receivables

 

 

 

 

The Group provides for ECL for all ﬁ nancial assets based on general approach of 

12-months ECL either individual or collective basis.

 

 

 

 

The Group has performed speciﬁ c credit risk assessment on the loan to a third party. 

The interest repayment due on 31 December 2021 is now overdue and this indicated 

a signiﬁ cant increase in the credit risk since the initial recognition of the ﬁ nancial 

assets. Accordingly, the Group changed the impairment loss allowance from 12-month 

ECL to lifetime ECL and determined that the ECL of US$1,440,000 is required as at 31 

December 2021 (2020: Nil). Further details of the assessment are disclosed in Note 20.

 

 

 

(C) 

Debt instrument

 

 

 

 

The non-current debt instrument is recognised initially at fair value. Further details of 

the initial recognition are disclosed in Note 17. Subsequently, the Group assess and 

record the ECL for debt instrument based on general approach of 12-months ECL and 

computes the ECL based on probability-weighted scenario analysis.

Liquidity risk

 

 

 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter diﬃ  culty in meeting 

ﬁ nancial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure 

to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of ﬁ nancial assets and 

liabilities.

 

 

 

The Group maintains suﬃ  cient liquidity at all times by eﬃ  cient cash and working capital 

management.

 

 

 

The Group’s ability to meet its obligations is managed by maintaining appropriate level of 

cash balance and working capital balances. During the year, the Group has successfully 

reﬁ nanced an existing term loan of US$300,000,000 that is due in December 2021 with a 

syndicated loan that carries a tenure of three years.

 

 

 

During the year, certain subsidiaries of the Company have entered into a facility agreement 

with the Company’s parent for a short-term working capital loan for general working capital 

purposes.

 

 

 

Non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments

 

 

 

The following tables detail the remaining contractual maturity for non-derivative ﬁ nancial 

instruments.

 

 

 

The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash ﬂ ows of ﬁ nancial liabilities 

based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The tables include 

both interest and principal cash ﬂ ows. The adjustment column represents the possible future 

interest cash outﬂ ow attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which 

are not included in the carrying amount of the ﬁ nancial asset or liabilities on the statement of 

ﬁ nancial position.

Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments

 

 

 

The liquidity analysis for derivative ﬁ nancial instruments has been drawn up based on the 

undiscounted net cash inﬂ ows/(outﬂ ows) on the derivative instrument that settle on a net 

basis and the undiscounted gross inﬂ ows and outﬂ ows on those derivatives that require 

gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not ﬁ xed, the amount disclosed 

has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates as illustrated by the yield 

curves existing at the end of the reporting period.

 

 

 

Please refer to Note 21 for more details.

 

 

(v) 

Commodity price risk

 

 

 

Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, the Group is exposed to changes in agricultural 

commodity prices.

 

 

 

The Group managed the exposure on commodity price risk by utilising forward physical 

contracts and/or derivatives to manage the Group’s open commodity positions. The 

Group also reviewed daily monitoring reports on market positioning to facilitate decision 

making�process on the Group’s exposure.

 

 

 

At the end of the reporting period, a 5% increase/decrease of the commodities price index, 

with all other variables held constant, would have increased/decreased proﬁ t before income 

tax by US$4,470,000 (2020: increased/decreased proﬁ t before income tax by US$430,000) 

and increased/decreased equity by US$4,470,000 (2020: increased/decreased equity by 

US$430,000).

Fair value of assets and liabilities

 

(a) 

Fair value hierarchies

 

 

The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on 

the valuation inputs used as follows:

 

 

Level 1 

– 

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the 

Group can access at the measurement date,

 

 

Level 2 

– 

Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 

asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and

 

 

Level 3 

– 

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 

(b) 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value

Fair value of assets and liabilities (cont’d)

 

(c) 

Level 2 fair value measurements

 

 

The fair value of inventories (except consumables) are calculated using quoted prices in relevant 

commodity exchanges at the end of the reporting period, making adjustments according to the 

stage of production of the inventories, port of loading, and grades of products. Where such prices 

are not available, the Group uses valuation models to determine the fair values based on relevant 

factors, including trade price quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the commodities 

and commodity exchange price quotations and dealer quotations for similar commodities traded in 

diﬀ erent markets and geographical areas, existing at the end of the reporting period.

 

(d) 

Level 3 fair value measurements

 

 

(i) 

Information about signiﬁ cant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements

 

 

 

Biological assets

 

 

 

The fair value of the Group’s major biological assets has been determined based on 

valuations by an independent professional valuer using the discounted cash ﬂ ow valuation 

approach. The most signiﬁ cant inputs into the discounted cash ﬂ ow valuation approach are 

the average annual yield and discount rate. The fair value of biological assets is computed 

using the following:

2021

2020

Malaysia

Average annual yield for rubber trees in Malaysia plantation 

(Metric tonne per hectare)

1.2

1.7

Discount rate for rubber trees in Malaysia plantation (%)

11.0

11.0

Cameroon

Average annual yield for rubber trees in Cameroon plantation 

(Metric tonne per hectare)

1.7 – 2.0

1.7 – 2.0

Discount rate for rubber trees in Cameroon plantation (%)

13.0

13.0

 

 

 

An increase in average annual yield per hectare will result in an increase to the fair value of 

biological assets, while an increase in discount rate will result in a decrease of estimated fair 

value.

 

 

 

At the end of the reporting period, a 1.0% increase/decrease in average annual yield will 

increase/decrease the fair value of biological asset by US$7,418,000 and a 0.5% increase/

decrease in discount rate will decrease/increase the fair value of biological asset by 

US$20,459,000 for Cameroon plantations.

and utilities, size and date of transaction.

Valuation policies and procedures

 

 

 

It is the Group’s policy to engage external valuation experts to perform the valuation of 

biological assets and investment properties. The management is responsible for selecting 

and engaging valuation experts that possess the relevant credentials and knowledge on 

the subject of valuation, valuation methodologies, and SFRS(I) 13 fair value measurement 

guidance.

 

 

 

Management reviews the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and assumptions 

adopted, and the reliability of the inputs used in the valuations.

 

(e) 

Fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments not measured at fair value and whose carrying 

amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value

 

 

The carrying amounts of cash and bank balances (Note 18), trade receivables (Note 19), loans and 

other receivables (Note 20), trade payables (Note 24), other payables (Note 25), and loan payables 

(Note 26) approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these 

ﬁ nancial instruments or that they are ﬂ oating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest 

rates on or near the statement of ﬁ nancial position date.

37. 

Dividends on ordinary shares

 

The Group has not paid dividend on ordinary shares during the Financial Year 2021 and 2020.

38. 

Capital management

 

The Group reviews its capital structure at least annually to ensure that the Group will be able to continue 

as a going concern, while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and 

equity balance.

 

The Group is required to comply with loan covenants imposed by the lenders, unless it is speciﬁ cally 

waived by the lenders. This externally imposed requirement has been complied with by the Group in 

ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021, with the exception of loans of certain 

subsidiaries for ﬁ nancial year ended 31 December 2021. As at 31 December 2021, the subsidiaries 

obtained waivers from the banks for bank loans with carrying amount of US$187,000,000 (2020: 

US$180,861,000) for the non-fulﬁ lment of ﬁ nancial covenants.

 

The capital structure of the Group comprises only of issued capital and retained earnings. The Group 

manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. 

To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, 

return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or 

processes during the years ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020.

 

The Group is committed to a sustainable dividend policy that ensures its capital allocation is being decided 

in a way that delivers long-term, sustainable returns.� In considering the level of dividend payments, 

the Board will consider all of the above factors and strive to ensure that its capital allocation are being 

decided in a way that delivers long-term, sustainable returns. As at 31 December 2021, the Board does not 

recommend dividend as it deems that it is appropriate to retain and reinvest such earnings in the Group, to 

allow greater ﬂ exibility on capital management and ensure availability of ﬁ nancial resources to respond to 

temporary disruptions and to aid in medium-term recovery.
