Highlights 

1.1 

Corporate Profile 

Interra Resources Limited (‘Interra’ or the ‘Company’), together with its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), are 

engaged in the business of petroleum exploration and production (E&amp;P). Our E&amp;P activities include petroleum 

production, field development and exploration. We are positioning ourselves to become a leading regional 

independent producer of petroleum. 

Since our inception, we have grown organically by developing our existing assets as well as through 

disciplined acquisitions by seeking attractive resource opportunities across Southeast Asia. Our portfolio of 

production, development and exploration assets comprises four petroleum contract areas in Indonesia and 

Myanmar. 

Interra is listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange. 

1.2 

Scope of Sustainability Report 

The scope of the report dated 27 March 2019 covers information on material sustainability aspects of 

Interra, namely the Group’s significant joint venture entity in Myanmar, Goldpetrol Joint Operating Company 

Inc. (Goldpetrol), from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 unless otherwise specified. This should 

sufficiently address stakeholders’ concerns in relation to sustainability issues arising from the major 

business operations of the Group. 

Interra owns 60% of Goldpetrol, which operates the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields in central Myanmar, 

under two Improved Petroleum Recovery Contracts (IPRCs) with the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise 

(MOGE). Interra manages the operatorship of both oil fields jointly with a joint-venture partner, China 

ZhenHua Oil Co., Ltd (ZhenHua Oil). The oil fields cover a total area of approximately 1,800 km2 and are 

located along the Ayeyarwaddy River, about 580 km north of Yangon.  

During financial year under review, the combined gross production for both oil fields was 887,896 barrels of 

oil (BO), comprising 97% of the total oil production by the Group. 

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core Option as it 

provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted as a global standard for sustainability 

reporting. It also considers the Sustainability Reporting Guide in Practice Note 7.6 of the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Manual. In preparing our report, we applied the GRI’s 

principles for defining report content and report quality by considering the Group’s activities, impacts and 

substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders.  

The data and information provided within the report have not been verified by an independent third party. 

We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy.

Message to Stakeholders 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Interra Resources Limited, I am pleased to present the 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 (FY2018).  

Developing resources responsibly requires a collective effort and everyone has a role to play. We must 

continue to operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and collaborate with communities in a 

mutually beneficial way. In addition, energy producers depend on host governments to develop policies that 

are based upon sound principles and, at the same time, serve to balance social, economic and 

environmental goals. Regulatory processes should be clear and transparent, and hold industry players 

accountable for their performance. 

With more than 20 years of experience in developing Myanmar’s crude oil resources and cooperating with 

the MOGE, Interra’s long-term commitment to safe operations, minimised impact on the land, air and water, 

as well as investment in our communities remains strong. 

In the FY2018 sustainability report, we will report on the Group’s sustainability efforts on Sustainable 

Development, Environmental Stewardship, Health and Safety, and Community. The sustainability report 

highlights our business principles and approach, and how we are meeting the demand for energy in an 

economically, environmentally and socially responsible way. Interra continues to stay true to “Exploring, 

Discovering Value” by being responsible, mindful and ethical, while focusing on delivering results thereby 

positioning the Company for profitable and sustainable growth. 

While we strive to make continual progress, there are always opportunities for improvement. Starting from 

this year, we have also included the key commitments for each area of our sustainability strategy in order to 

ensure that we have a robust sustainability programme in place.  

We wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation. 

The Board has determined the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and overseen 

the management in monitoring these material ESG factors. 

On behalf of the Board of Directors

2.2 

Sustainability Strategy 

At the Group, our sustainability strategy aims to create integrated values. Not only do we create economic 

value by maximising profits and shareholder value, but we also take on a broader responsibility as a global 

corporate citizen to create societal values. We commit to deliver value to all our stakeholders.  

As we look back on our progress over the last year, our efforts to deliver value to all our stakeholders can be 

summarised as follows: 

 

 

 

The sustainable strategy is underpinned by: 

(i) Policies and guidelines 

Including our Employee Handbook which establishes a clear tone at the top with regards to employees’ 

business and ethical conduct (including declaration of conflicts of interest); and 

(ii) Management systems 

Including our Environment Management Plan (EMP) which helps us align to best practices for managing 

environmental risks associated with crude oil extraction. The EMP has been in place at our Myanmar 

operations since 2014. 

Our sustainability strategy is guided by a variety of external sources, including the GRI Standards and 

Sustainability Reporting Guide set out in Practice Note 7.6 of the SGX-ST) Listing Manual. 

The rest of this report covers our progress and performance against each of these areas, and the impact we 

have on the economy, environment and society as a result.

Consulting Our Stakeholders 

We engage both internal and external stakeholders on a regular basis with the goal of strengthening our 

sustainability approach and performance. We listen to their expectations – and views on how well we are 

meeting them – as well as collaborating with them for deeper insights and mutual benefits.  

Through our stakeholder engagement processes, we gather both qualitative and quantitative input, which 

are essential in forming both our strategic direction and our day-to-day performance, and maximising the 

value of our contributions across all groups.  

In mapping our stakeholders, we have identified those to whom we have legal, commercial or moral 

responsibility – such as our regulators, suppliers and the communities around our operational areas. The 

other equally important groups – because we depend on them to operate – are our people and our business 

partners. 

An overview of our approach and rationale is set out below (with stakeholders listed in alphabetical order) 

together with the feedback we have received.

Sustainability Materiality 

Based on the stakeholder engagement, we developed our sustainability materiality matrix containing 

material aspects which are aligned with our principal business and operational risks, and formed our 

sustainability strategy which has shaped our approach to sustainability reporting, as illustrated in the 

diagram below.  

We will review and adjust the matrix each year as the external and business context changes. 

The aspect boundaries ‘within’ the organisation are limited to Goldpetrol, whereas the aspect boundaries 

‘outside’ the organisation include business partners, community, customers, employees, regulators, 

shareholders and investors, and suppliers.

Our Performance 

3.1 

How We Measure Our Performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams for 

each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programmes have advanced through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our 

sustainability strategy. Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure 

alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability programme in place, we have included the key commitments for 

each area of our sustainability strategy. The progress we have made against each key commitment is 

indicated using the symbols shown in the table below. 

We track and review our sustainability programme with the Board of Directors at least once a year.

3.2 

Sustainable Development 

Overview 

Since 1997, we have been operating the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields in central Myanmar, and cooperating 

with the MOGE. Armed with robust drilling and development plans as well as investments in new technologies, 

Goldpetrol is well-positioned to deliver sustainable development for the Group for the future. 

Long-term plans 

In 2017, Goldpetrol was successfully awarded an 11-year extension of the IPRCs for the Chauk and 

Yenangyaung oil fields. In addition, Interra entered into a conditional subscription agreement with North 

Petroleum International Company Limited (NPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZhenHua Oil, for the 

subscription of 79.5 million new ordinary shares in the capital of Interra by way of a private placement, which 

was completed on 30 January 2018. 

In light of these new developments, together with lessons learnt from the Group’s cost and operational 

control strategies in previous years, Goldpetrol is well-positioned to leverage on the strategic partnership 

between Interra and ZhenHua Oil, and put in place the investment and development planned for the oil fields 

and increase production output in the years ahead. 

Managing continual improvement 

In FY2018, Goldpetrol pushed ahead with its drilling campaign and accelerated its field activities. A total of 

eleven wells were drilled, of which two were under the 2019 drilling programme and spudded early in view of 

favourable dry surface conditions and rig availability. Eight wells were completed as oil producers, seven in the 

Chauk field and one in the Yenangyaung field, contributing to an increase in production averaging 500 BO per 

day.  

As part of our strategy, Goldpetrol has committed to improve oil production progressively over the new 

contract period ending in 2028. As a result of our drilling efforts combined with effective field operations and 

production management, oil production increased by 6% from FY2017 to FY2018, on the FY2017 baseline. 

Recent significant oil producers have been from wells primarily drilled in the Chauk South Central Fault 

Block and the Chauk North Fault Block. The continued development of these blocks is expected to 

accelerate production from these oil reservoirs. We continue to have successful results from directional 

drilling under the Ayeyarwaddy River from the east bank of northern Chauk field to penetrate un-drained 

producing reservoirs. Drilling in other producing areas of both Chauk and Yenangyaung fields have added 

materially to production gains and development of these will continue. In addition, there has been a renewed 

effort to identify existing wells that could add to production gains by perforations in un-tested reservoirs and 

to re-open old shut-in wells. All are aimed at increasing production volumes and adding to our oil reserves 

base.  

Identification of new technologies 

In February 2018, Goldpetrol completed the acquisition of eleven patent rights from Chengdu North 

Petroleum Exploration &amp; Development Technology Co., Ltd (CNPED), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

ZhenHua Oil. The patents will be utilised to enhance oil production in the Chauk and Yenangyaung fields 

using enhanced oil recovery methods and other technologies. 

By adopting the patents in Myanmar, Goldpetrol is introducing new technologies to the Myanmar oil and gas 

industry which will benefit the industry in general.

The Water-Flood Project 

In 2018, Goldpetrol commenced a secondary oil recovery project implemented through water-flooding 

(WF) of producing oil reservoirs in the Chauk oil field (the ‘Water-Flood Project’).  

Oil extraction over the history of operatorship in the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields by Goldpetrol (and 

its predecessor) since 1997 has principally been by Primary Recovery, i.e. either by hydrocarbons flowing 

to the surface due to natural reservoir pressure or lifting by pumping methods. It has been recognised that 

both fields could benefit from WF, a process which is generally accepted as having the potential to 

significantly increase oil recovery. This would be effective in both maintaining reservoir pressure and 

sweeping oil locked in the reservoirs to producing areas.  

Preliminary tests were initiated in the Yenangyaung field approximately 10 years ago using simple gravity 

injection of water into shut-in wells on the fringes of producing areas. Although the process was not nearly 

as controlled as a true WF, it did succeed in increasing oil production in the certain wells. Having 

confirmed that the reservoirs were receptive to water injection, a small-scale pilot project was initiated in the 

Chauk field in 2016 using injection pumps and existing wells for both injection and targets. Since the 

beginning of the pilot WF, there has been an average oil production gain of these combined targeted wells of 

approximately 75 BO per day.  

Concurrent with the pilot project, planning began on a more extensive WF project for the entire Singu 

North producing fault block in northern Chauk field with numerous wells and multiple reservoirs to be 

injected. This highly technical planning has involved expertise from both Goldpetrol and an external 

petroleum research centre. The implementation of the project has begun and will have at least six pump 

supported injector wells targeting over twenty producing oil wells.  

In addition, smaller scale WF project, which began in the Yenangyaung field during the second quarter of 

the year, have already given positive gains. Planning has also commenced for WF project in other 

producing fault blocks in both Chauk and Yenangyaung fields.

Environmental Stewardship 

Overview 

Goldpetrol is committed to operating in an environmentally responsible manner to develop Myanmar’s crude 

oil reserves and resources. We seek to reduce our impact on wildlife, land, air and water at our operations 

through our commitment to our EMP and adherence to government regulations. 

In FY2018, we had no spills and no regulatory compliance incidents in Myanmar, demonstrating the benefit of 

integrating environmental initiatives into our business plans and strategies. We are mindful of the environment in 

which we operate and we strive to minimise our impact.  

Managing greenhouse gas emissions 

The risks associated with climate change are real and warrant action. Increasing carbon emissions in the 

atmosphere are having a warming effect. There is broad scientific and policy consensus that actions must 

be taken to further quantify and assess the risks. 

Goldpetrol has the same concerns as people everywhere – how to provide the world with the energy it 

needs while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are committed to positive action on climate 

change and dedicated to reducing the risk in the most efficient way for society by reducing GHG emissions 

in our operations. 

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from Goldpetrol and then calculate its total 

annual GHG emissions. 

In FY2018, Goldpetrol generated a carbon 

footprint of 12,629 tonnes of carbon dioxide 

emission (tCO2e) with a carbon emission 

intensity of 14.2 kilograms of carbon dioxide 

emission 

(kgCO2e) 

per 

barrel 

of 

oil 

production. The emission mainly arises from 

purchased electricity which accounted for 

69% of the total carbon emission of 

Goldpetrol. 

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 

established by the World Resources Institute 

and 

the 

World 

Business 

Council 

for 

Sustainable Development, the standard 

manual for measuring corporate greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

Using the “control method”, we include 

100% of the emissions associated with 

businesses which we directly control. Our 

carbon footprint includes: 

� 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

� 

All purchased electricity used in our facilities (Scope 2 emissions) 

� 

Impact of business air travel (optional Scope 3 emissions) 

Carbon footprint per barrel of oil production increased substantially from the previous year due to increased 

drilling activities in the current year and the inclusion of our diesel consumption from motor vehicles into the 

computation of our carbon footprint in FY2018. Energy consumption is expected to increase in tandem with 

the drilling campaign and accelerated field activities. 

As part of our strategy, Goldpetrol has committed to maintain the carbon footprint per barrel of oil production 

over the new contract period ending 2028.

Energy efficiency 

Energy consumed in our operations generates 99% of our GHG emissions and is one of our largest 

operating costs. As such, energy efficiency presents a tremendous opportunity to make an impact on both 

the environment and our bottom line by reducing emissions, lowering costs and improving competitiveness.  

Our energy consumption comprises the following: 

� 

Electricity consumption arising from operations of our offices and oil pump;  

� 

Diesel consumption from operations of motor vehicles. As we only commenced tracking diesel 

consumption in FY2018, this criteria was not taken into consideration in our computation of GHG 

emissions in FY2017. 

Whilst we take measures to reduce energy consumption through regular maintenance of our machinery, 

energy consumption is expected to increase in tandem with the drilling campaign and accelerated field 

activities. 

Water use 

Given that our operations are situated along the Ayeyarwaddy River in central Myanmar, we are always 

focused on freshwater conservation opportunities and the efficient use of water through the design, 

operation and expansion of our facilities.  

In the past, water extracted together with crude oil production (formation water) through primary recovery 

method was routed for sedimentation at the treatment pits before being discharged into the river. Since 

2016, we have been using the gravity injection of water in our oil fields to both increase oil production in 

offset wells and properly dispose of formation water. The ultimate goal is to reach zero discharge of water 

produced into the river and the surrounding environment.  

With the implementation of the Water-Flood Project in 2018, the requirement for increased access to water 

supply for injection has been met by the use of recycled formation water supplemented by pumped river 

water. Formation water is also being used for injection in the smaller WF project in Yenangyaung.  

Land and waste management and biodiversity 

Minimising our impact to land and biodiversity is a key consideration throughout all life stages of our 

operations, from exploration, drilling and production, to responsible waste management, site reclamation 

and closure. We continue to develop and employ best practices and technologies to reduce our surface 

footprint and environmental impacts.

Health and Safety 

Overview 

Safety is a core value in every aspect of Goldpetrol’s operations. Ensuring the safety of the people who work 

in or live near our operational areas is our number one priority.  

In FY2018, we achieved an incident frequency rate of zero. 

Operational safety 

We continue to make progress on our commitment to achieve a safe and secure workplace through a strong 

focus on leadership behaviour, workforce engagement, risk management and consistent application of our 

EMP, which has been in place at our Myanmar operations since 2014. 

The EMP is a comprehensive framework with a common set of expectations that embodies our commitment 

to managing personnel and process safety as well as operational and environmental risks inherent in our 

business. 

In FY2018, key focus areas included: 

� 

Training and prevention programmes, including safety leadership, risk tolerance and approaching others 

� 

Risk management with active processes to facilitate mitigation of key residual risks and prevention of 

significant events 

While we manage our business with the goal of preventing incidents, we are prepared for emergencies and 

can respond quickly, effectively, and with care to emergencies or incidents resulting from our operations. In 

the event of an incident, locally-trained personnel are supported by a response team from MOGE to control 

the situation, minimise impacts and restore operations in as short a time as possible. 

As part of our strategy to ensure safety in our operations, Goldpetrol has committed to limit overtime hours 

per employee to a maximum of 120 hours on an ongoing basis. In FY2018, Goldpetrol clocked 115 overtime 

hours per employee, within the limit set.  

Knowledge transfer and sharing 

Together with our joint venture partner, we periodically conduct short-courses and on-the-job training for our 

workers to ensure that they are well-equipped to manage new and emerging oil production processes that 

are currently being put in place.  

Some of the topics covered include: 

� 

Drilling and workover operations 

� 

Gas and oil collecting station management 

� 

Mud engineering 

� 

Cooling oil circulation and dewaxing processes 

� 

Pumping unit maintenance 

� 

Emergency handling of chemical release/spill 

� 

Environment awareness 

� 

Fire safety 

� 

Chemical handling 

� 

Waste disposal and segregation 

As part of our strategy to ensure safety in our operations, Goldpetrol has committed to achieve a minimum 

of 40 hours of training per employee on an ongoing basis. In FY2018, Goldpetrol clocked 40 training hours 

per employee, fulfilling the minimum requirement.

Community 

Overview 

Goldpetrol has long been a part of the community which we operate in. We offer financial and volunteer 

support to MOGE-organised community outreach exercises in Chauk and Yenangyaung each year, and we 

are actively engaged in community services. 

Community involvement 

Our giving and community engagement is guided by our main areas of focus, which include: 

� 

Education and sports 

� 

Healthcare 

� 

Basic infrastructure building and maintenance 

� 

Indigenous capacity and community building 

As part of our strategy to give back to the community, Goldpetrol has committed to invest at least 

US$100,000 towards community development on an ongoing basis. In FY2018, Goldpetrol invested more 

than US$143,000 in the Chauk and Yenangyaung communities, towards the causes of education, sports, 

healthcare, infrastructure and community building.  

For example, as part of the Yenangyaung township development project in collaboration with the local 

government, we committed more than US$89,000 to provide a garbage collection truck, power supply 

transformer and water supply storage tanks, to construct recreational facilities, and to build a drainage ditch 

and access road. 

Stakeholder engagement 

While the government grants the permit for development, the community provides crucial support towards 

our operations. Our stakeholders offer a variety of perspectives on energy development. Engaging in regular 

discussions with these parties is crucial to responsible operations. 

Goldpetrol’s operations and development opportunities are located within local communities. We support 

communities in areas where we explore, develop and operate, and strive to establish lasting relationships 

built on mutual trust and respect. 

In FY2018, stakeholder engagement activities included: 

� 

Site visit by drilling contractors to inspect drilling operations including safety and environment protection 

aspects 

� 

Field visit by investors to learn about oil and gas operations including the environment, health and safety 

impacts 

Others 

We also seek to create long-term economic and social benefits for our communities, including workforce and 

supplier development. Enhancing education, developing a skilled workforce, creating jobs and supporting a 

reliable local supply network drive both economic growth and a higher standard of living. 

Workforce 

We seek to attract and retain employees interested in a long-term career with the company. Our Standards 

of Business Conduct govern all aspects of our employment and support our commitment to provide equal 

employment opportunities, prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace and align with applicable 

laws and regulations. 

Supplier development 

All of our suppliers and contractors must adhere to our requirements regarding safety, health, security and 

the environment, as well as the principles of our Standards of Business Conduct. We are also focused on 

developing local indigenous businesses through regular meetings with them to ensure they are aware of the 

opportunities created by our projects and understand our requirements.
