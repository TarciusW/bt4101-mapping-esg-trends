Dear Stakeholders,

It is my pleasure to present to you Yangzijiang Shipbuilding 

(Holdings) Limited’s (“Yangzijiang” or “the Group”) 

sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 

December 2019 (“FY2019”) 

Sustainability has become an increasingly pressing issue as 

the global economy progresses and its structure evolves. 

The COVID-19 pandemic spreading around the world 

with growing severity now has reminded us again of the 

implication of humans’ economic and social activities on the 

earth and on our lives. It reminded us to always be humble 

and respect nature, and take a balanced approach when 

we make business decisions. This requires us to have the 

wisdom and vision to balance the interests in the pursuit of 

profit, protecting the welfare of our people and preserving 

the planet, both in the near term and the long term. 

At Yangzijiang, we take sustainability as a business approach 

to creating long-term value by considering how we operate 

in the economic, social, and ecological environment. We 

recognise the need to act on sustainability well before the 

expectations on corporate responsibility increased in the 

recent years, and now we are glad to take several steps 

further to engage our stakeholders on the communication 

of relevant sustainability matters in recognised reporting 

frameworks. 

Our sustainability reporting revolves around the three pillars 

of sustainability issues under the Global Reporting Standard 

(GRI) system, namely, economic development, environmental 

protection, and social development. As a summary, we will 

be discussing the following matters in detail:  

(I) ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION

Since its public listing on the Singapore Exchange in 2007, 

Yangzijiang has been consistently profitable every year. 

While delivering hundreds of quality vessels to ship owners 

globally, we provided employment for tens of thousands 

of workers, paid a dividend every year to thousands of 

shareholders, and Yangzijiang has also been one of the 

largest taxpayers to the local government in the People’s 

Republic of China (“PRC”). 

Based on the Group’s financial performance, particularly 

revenue, the Group was ranked 359th in the top 500 Chinese 

Companies List in September 2019 by The China Enterprise 

Confederation and the China Entrepreneurs Association. This 

was up by 90 places from that of 2018. This list consisted of 

265 state-owned companies and 235 private enterprises. 

The Group was also ranked 361st in Fortune China 500 

Companies in 2019, up 19 places from 2018.

Jan 2020

Inaugural delivery by YAMIC 

YAMIC delivered its first two 82,000DWT vessels to a 

customer, only four months since its start of operation in 

August 2019. The vessels were proprietarily designed by 

Yangzijiang.  

Aug 2019

Opening ceremony of YAMIC 

The ceremony took place at the Group’s Taicang yard. 

The joint venture between Yangzijiang and Mistui started 

operation in August 2019.





(II) ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

In recent years, the shipping sector has been in the spotlight and in the discussion of sustainability issues, especially in 

environmental protection amid the accelerated climate change, pollution, and the pursuit of a zero-carbon economy. As 

such, a good part of our sustainability strategy is to address the challenges that our customers – the ship owners face. These 

challenges include meeting the regulatory cap on the sulphur content in fuel oil, and the choice of environmental-friendly 

and economically feasible fuels. 

As shipbuilding technologies advance rapidly to find new ways to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, we made tireless 

efforts to make sure that our technology and construction procedures represent the latest development in the industry and 

the trends for the future. In 2019, we completed the delivery of all the six units of the generation II Very-Large-Ore-Carriers 

(VLOCs) to our customer. These VLOCs were designed with improved shape and specifications, which save energy consumption 

by 19% under the same speed and draught. 

ABOUT YAMIC

Yangzi-Mitsui Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (YAMIC), our joint venture 

with prominent Japanese shipbuilding companies, Mitsui 

E&amp;S Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (“MES-SC”) and Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. 

(together with MES-SC, “Mitsui”), started operation in August 

2019. Combining the advanced shipbuilding technologies 

and extensive resources at Mitsui and Yangzijiang’s strengths 

in shipbuilding and cost control, YAMIC will play an important 

role in fulfilling our sustainability strategies, by introducing 

high-tech, high-specification vessels, especially gas carriers. 

Over time, we would like to build YAMIC into the best 

shipyard in the world for mid-sized clean energy vessels 

and LNG carriers,

(III) SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 

Given the nature of our business, health and safety is a 

key factor to promote the wellness of both our employees 

and the Group. It is a duty and moral responsibility for 

us to look after our employees’ health and safety. In the 

report, we will provide a detailed update on Yangizjiang’s 

practice in promoting workplace safety, including training, 

monitoring, reporting, and rescue procedures. We will also 

discuss our practice in general training and development, 

including the efforts in improving industry practices, our 

internal training programs such as Project Voyage, as well 

as our collaboration with local universities and vocational 

institutions to nurture talent for the industry. 

Yangzijiang’s long tradition of returning to society has its 

roots in our Honorary Chairman, Ren Yuanlin’s deep belief 

in giving and sharing. Yuanlin Charity Foundation, which is 

solely funded by our Honorary Chairman with his annual 

dividend from his shareholdings in Yangzijiang, has helped 

improve the life quality for thousands of retired senior 

citizens and cured cataract for thousands of patients. Yuanlin 

Rehabilitation Hospital, a new charity initiative under the 

Yuanlin Charity Foundation, started operation in May 2019.  

Upholding the sharing spirit, Yangzijiang has also been giving 

donations to various individuals and organisations for a 

variety of causes. 

MANAGING THE BUSINESS THE SUSTAINABLE WAY 

We live in an interdependent world. It is in our own 

interest to manage the business for the greater good of 

sustainability. Care for sustainability allows us to gain a 

deeper understanding of our customers’ needs and improve 

trust and stakeholder engagement. It spurs us to promote 

innovation and contribute to environmental protection. It 

reminds us to strengthen community relations and enhance 

our brand value. 

We welcome ideas and suggestions on sustainability matters 

from all our customers, suppliers, employees, regulators, 

and shareholders; your views and suggestions will be 

considered in our regular review of the sustainability strategy 

in the board meetings. I would also like to encourage all 

our stakeholders to stay mindful of our activities and their 

implications on the environment and the community, and 

contribute our part to a sustainable future together.

04 - CHANGES IN GROUP STRUCTURE

BUILDING UP GAS-CARRIER CAPABILITIES

As Yangzi-Mitsui Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (YAMIC) prepared 

for the start of operation in 2019, the Group made two 

acquisitions to grow its capability in vessel design and 

terminal facilities. 

In February 2019, the Group acquired 51% of the stake in 

Shanghai Econovo Marine Engineering Co., Ltd (“Shanghai 

Econovo”). Shanghai Econovo is a professional engineering 

company with leading design capabilities in gas carriers 

(LPG, LEG &amp; LNG), tankers, bulk carriers, containerships, and 

other vessel types. The acquisition was part of its strategy 

to enhance its competitiveness by developing new concepts 

and introducing new technologies to vessel construction and 

fortify its leading position in the shipbuilding industry. The 

acquisition was also expected to help the Group build up 

the capabilities in gas carriers. 

In July 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the stake in 

Odfjell Terminals China Holding Pte. Ltd. (“OTCH”), which 

held a 55% equity interest in Odfjell Terminal (Jiangyin) 

Company Ltd (“OTJ”). OTJ owns and operates a tank terminal, 

which handles various types of petrochemical products 

and provides complete terminal services for petrochemical 

distribution in the downstream Yangtze River region. The 

Group has since taken steps to convert it into a terminal 

that can handle and store gas products, to stay closer to the 

gas-related transportation market, and facilitate the growth 

of its gas carrier-related business. 

OTHER ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS 

In January 2019, the Group, through its wholly-owned 

subsidiary, Jiangsu Yanghong Marine Import and Export 

Co., Ltd. (“Yanghong”) acquired 40% of the equity interest 

of shareholdings of Jiangsu Yangzi Zhuoneng Industrial Co., 

Ltd. (“Zhuoneng”). Further to the acquisition, Zhuoneng has 

become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. Zhuoneng 

is in the business of trading of metals, paper products, 

plastic products including raw materials and products and 

sales, research, and development of mechanical equipment. 

Zhuoneng has brought in an additional revenue stream to 

the Group and helped to reduce the Group’s dependency 

on the import and export of steel-related product from third 

party for its shipbuilding activities. 

In January 2019, the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary, 

Jiangsu Jiangyin-Jingjiang Industry Zone Barber-CS Marine 

Technology Co., Ltd (“Barber-CS”), a company registered 

in Jiangyin City, People’s Republic of China, had completed 

the dissolution process following the relevant laws and 

regulations of People’s Republic of China. The dissolution 

of Barber-CS did not have any significant impact on the 

earnings per share and net tangible assets of the Group for 

the financial year 2019.

In July 2019, the Group announced that its wholly-owned 

subsidiary of the Company, Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding 

Co.Ltd has disposed of the entire 95% equity interest in the 

registered capital of Nanjing Saiyang Equity Investment 

Enterprise, a company registered in the Nanjing City, People’s 

Republic of China, for a consideration of RMB 65,550,000 

(equivalent to approximately SGD13.1 million). The disposal 

was part of the structure streamlining exercise and to control 

the overall administrative expenses.

05 - STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

The Group actively engages its suppliers, industry associations, banks, government bodies, and academic institutions to 

improve the standards of shipbuilding in China. These include formal collaboration agreements, exchanges, site visits, and 

industry forums. It regularly submits its R&amp;D findings to industry bodies for adoption.

Within the organisation, it has many initiatives for employee skills upgrade and volunteer work to assist the needy in the 

community. There is a strong incentive reward program to encourage employees to come up with innovative methods to 

improve the Group’s productivity and efficiency.

Vessel delivery

Delivery of an 83,500DWT chemical carrier to a Norwegian 

customer. This vessel type represents several technological 

breakthroughs at Yangzijiang given some specific 

requirements in the design of the vessel.



Jan 2020

Vessel delivery 

Yangzijiang delivered a 2,200TEU containership to CMA CGM, 

the first in this batch of orders. The vessels were installed 

with rear propellers to enable free movement in the port 

area without using a tug boat.

Innovation of cost-saving, efficient vessel launching method 

Yard and dock capacity is a key factor that affects the efficiency, cost control, and production cycle in shipbuilding. To constantly 

improve efficiency and cost controlling measures, in 2019, the Group introduced the semi-submerged ship launching method 

that is commonly used in more advanced Korean yards. With the joint teamwork with its partners from Mitsui, three 82,000 

DWT dry bulkers were launched this way at YAMIC. 

This method uses a floating dock rather than a slipway or dry dock used in the traditional way of launching vessels. It doesn’t 

require vessels to be built in docks, and hence removes the limitations of dock capacity, allows increased production volume 

and output, and substantially enhances shipbuilding efficiency. It is also a cost-efficient way to increase capacity quickly. The 

16,000 DWT floating dock that was used in the semi-submerged launch was also designed and built by Yangzijiang.

08 - GOVERNANCE &amp; RISK MANAGEMENT




Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Ltd.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Managing Operational Risk

The Group’s shipbuilding customer base is well diversified geographically, with sales contributions from Asia, Australia, Europe, 

and Canada.  Its customer base consists of some of the most prominent shipowners in the world, and many of them have 

been Yangzijiang’s customers for decades.

In the shipbuilding business, a company should primarily focus on the prevention of the following operational risks, and under 

each item, we will discuss how the risk is managed at Yangzijiang. 

1. Cancellation of contract by customers 

• Shipbuilding contract terms and conditions are prudently negotiated to prevent customers from cancelling contracts 

unjustifiably. 

• The Group proactively liaises with ship owners to understand the charter demand outlook and customers’ needs to 

pre-empt and work out solutions to lower the risk of contract cancellation

• Agree to renegotiate on delivery schedule and rework of vessel types when the market condition is extremely 

challenging 

2. Customer is unable to obtain bank financing or guarantee for the contract 

• The Group provides assistance to customers where needed and feasible 

3. Delay in construction schedule 

• Technology-powered, seamless workflow to ensure that the production is on schedule 

• Enhance the integrity of the product in each module/section through all-year-round, systematic training to remove 

the need to rework 

• Proactive communication with customers in uncontrollable situations such as the shipyards’ shut for a few weeks due 

to COVID-19 in February to March 2020, to ensure on-time delivery

4. Disruption in the supply of raw materials and equipment 

• Using an established supplier qualifying system to manage a pool of qualified suppliers and reserve suppliers for 

each category of supplies 

• Regular review and feedback to suppliers on their product and service 

• Regular review of the supplier system to ensure the best cost for value and quality 

5. Cost overrun 

• Strict accountability to the head of the production unit on the control of production time and unit cost 

• Encourage all employees to contribute cost-saving ideas in every aspect of the production, provided that quality 

standard is not compromised. Often cost-saving ideas lead to a win-win situation for both the Group and the 

customer

6. Dispute on specification 

• Determine all the specification to the finest detail in the negotiation stage to prevent such dispute 

• Close communication with the customer during the construction process, seeking a feasible solution to problems 

occurred

• All communication and meeting records are well documented 

21




Sustainability Report 2019

MANAGING FINANCIAL RISK

The Group adopts a prudent and arguably, conservative approach in its financial management and accounting policies. It takes 

a conservative view in its budgeting in operations and makes provisions to reflect market conditions. 

Shipbuilding business

• The Group considers the expected adverse movement in the price of raw materials and the USD/RMB exchange 

rate, among other factors, between the time when a contract is signed and the time of vessel delivery, and makes 

provisions during the construction process accordingly. The provision is reviewed and adjusted regularly during the 

construction process 

• The Group also makes provisions on warranties for vessels delivered as a standard practice and writes it back after 

some time when the Group is no longer liable for the warranty coverage. 

Investment business 

• According to its investment guideline, the business only invests in projects with limited risk while giving the Group a 

higher level of fixed return than bank deposits to support the Group’s principal shipbuilding business 

• It’s the Group’s policy to cap the loan-to-value ratio at a strict level (50% or below), with the backing by accepted 

collaterals

• Accepted collaterals include public-traded shares, land, government guarantee (backed by government tax revenues) 

and other guarantee backed by various types of assets 

• The investment committee conducts thorough due diligence and the projects need to be approved by the voting of 

the investment committee

• The interest payment is closely monitored and actions are taken immediately as soon as any late payment is 

identified 

• The investment portfolio is reviewed at least once every quarter 

• Despite that the investment is backed up by collaterals, the Group makes provision according to the risk 

characteristics of each project

In fact, prudent management of financial risk is one important reason that the Group maintains a strong financial position 

over the years. 

22





An idea to improve the use of space, 

from frontline workers 

As painting was brought forward to an earlier part of the 

construction process (to streamline the production and 

improve efficiency), certain space needs to accommodate 

an increased number of steel pipes. Frontline workers came 

up with the idea of storing the pipes by piling up the racks 

of the same width. 

Use of QR code for supply management 

The Group rolled out the QR code-assisted supply 

management in phases at various divisions. The QR code 

enables the trackability on the use of each item and is 

expected to enhance the quality control and feedback loop. 

The application of the QR system was highly welcomed by 

shipowners.

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Ltd.

FOCUSED ON BUILDING R&amp;D STRENGTH  

Over the past few years, the Group has hired over 100 senior 

technology management experts, of whom 2 are recipients 

of State grants for technology development, 10 are college 

professor-level engineers,  23 are senior engineers, and 374 

are engineers. The total staff strength in R&amp;D and design was 

720 people as of end of 2019. Of which, over 500 people are 

based in the Group’s New Yangzi yard, 40 in Xinfu Yard, 35 

in YAMIC and 124 in the Group’s R&amp;D and research center 

in Shanghai. 

The Group retains employee loyalty through a comprehensive 

incentive/reward scheme. A clear incentive structure gives its 

employees better visibility for their career and compensation 

paths. This has led to reduced training costs and improved 

production efficiency. In April 2019, the Group’s Honorary 

Chairman (then Executive Chairman) donated 150 million 

of his personal shareholdings in Yangzijiang and set up a 

trust to reward the senior management of the Group and 

those have made significant contributions to Yangzijiang’s 

business. 

The Group also places a strategic focus on strengthening the 

educational profile of its employees in line with its target to 

enhance R&amp;D capabilities. R&amp;D headcount accounted for 

17% of Yangzijiang’s total staff strength as of December 

2019 .

Project Voyage and Internal Training 

Project Voyage is a training program that incorporates the 

Group’s strategic focus, and is jointly led by the Group’s 

senior management, the HR department and the Group’s 

R&amp;D Centre. Its curriculum was designed through the 

engagement of an external training services provider and 

is regularly reviewed and updated according to the feedback 

and input from the management of each division. 

The program comprises three stages, taking a total of 6 days 

over 2 months in 2018. In 2019, the program was intensified 

in line with the major strategy to upgrade the Group’s product 

mix with more focus on clean energy vessels. Mid-level and 

above managers participated in two full-day training each 

month from April to December. 

Yangzijiang’s achievements today are the result of the 

combined effort of all its employees. The Group has a 

comprehensive plan for human capital development, which 

extends from collaborative training programs with vocational 

schools, manpower recruitment through M&amp;A to on-going 

training schemes for existing staff. All employees receive 

regular performance reviews and career development advice 

from their direct supervisors, their mentors and/or the 

human resource department. 



Collaboration with Local Educational Institutions 

The Group’s collaboration with vocational schools has 

effectively created a talent pool, especially for technical 

personnel. An incentive program is in place to encourage 

its staff to pursue technical certificates and improve English 

language skills through continuous learning. It also set up 

various teams focusing on the training and development 

of fitters, welders, and engineers, incorporating overseas 

placement and exchanges.

It organises regular training for employees of all departments, 

especially for work unit heads on production sites and 

quality assurance staff. It also invites external speakers 

to conduct training on management skills and organises 

various contests for technical staff to constantly improve 

their knowledge and skills.

10 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Dealing with a Major Challenge Facing Humanity 

Seaborne trade accounts for 90% of global trade. Energy 

consumption and waste and gas emission of ships have a 

profound impact on the climate. wTypical issues are water 

pollution through the discharged ballast water and toxic 

chemicals used in anti-fouling paints, and air pollution 

through the emission of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 

and carbon dioxide. 

Since 1 January 2020, the IMO’s new requirement on the 

sulphur content in fuel oil used onboard ships has become 

effective. This means for ships operating outside designated 

emission control areas, the limit for the sulphur content in 

fuel oil has reduced to 0.5% m/m (mass by mass). According 

to the IMO, “This will significantly reduce the amount of 

sulphur oxides emanating from ships and should have major 

health and environmental benefits for the world, particularly 

for populations living close to ports and coasts”.

Under the new requirement, only ships fitted with sulphur-

cleaning devices known as scrubbers will be allowed to 

continue burning high-sulphur fuel. Shipowners can also opt 

for other sources of cleaner fuel such as liquefied natural 

gas (LNG). Failure to comply with the global regulations will 

not only affect the normal operations of the vessels, but 

also result in fines or vessels being detained, which could, 

in turn, affect the insurance coverage for the vessels, a vital 

requirement for its operation. 

A second important development is IMO’s intention to bring 

forward the deadline for energy efficiency in vessels by 3 

years to 20221. This covers gas carriers, general cargo ships, 

and LNG carriers. The revised Energy Efficiency Design 

Index (EEDI) requirement is 30% to 50% lower than what 

is currently allowed. Demand for LNG is likely to get a big 

boost both from the 2020 rules and from the move to reduce 

carbon dioxide.

1 https://safetyatsea.net/news/2018/low-sulphur-rule-to-

go-ahead-as-planned-imo-says/; https://www.maritime-

executive.com/article/imo-moves-to-strengthen-energy-

Operational System approved by the China 

Classification Society 

China Classification Society (“CCS”) conducted thorough 

inspection and review on the Group’s operational system 

from January 8th to 10th 2020 on quality control, energy 

consumption, environmental impact, and safety production, 

and concluded that the operating system was functioning 

effectively and was adequate for its day-to-day business 

operation. The review is conducted annually.

Building Capabilities in Clean Energy Vessels 

Yangzijiang aligns its interest with that of its customers 

(shipowners) by seeking constant improvement in the 

design of vessels for higher energy efficiency. Yangzi-Mitsui 

Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (YAMIC), the Group’s joint venture 

with Mitsui E&amp;S Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (“MES-SC”) and Mitsui 

&amp; Co., Ltd. (together with MES-SC, “Mitsui”) of Japan, holds 

long term significance not only to Yangzijiang for its next 

phase of growth, but also to the global shipping market by 

advancing the design and technology of clean energy vessels. 

YAMIC represents Yangzijiang’s ultimate determination in 

contributing its part to fighting climate change, through 

enabling ships operating more efficiently with less emission. 

Traditional Large Vessels, Made Environmentally 

Friendly

In March 2019, Yangzijiang delivered the last vessel in the 

orders for the six generation-II 400,000DWT very-large-

iron-ore carriers (VLOC) placed by ICBC Leasing and China 

Merchants Energy Shipping in 2016. With 362 metres in 

length, these VLOCs were the largest vessels ever built at 

Yangzijiang. It also made a world record with four of such 

big vessels being built simultaneously in one shipyard. The 

VLOC is equipped with four ballast pumps that can discharge 

4,000 cubic metres of water per hour, which matches the 

high-speed handling at Brazil port and saves the docking 

time and port cost for shipowners. Compared to the first 

generation of VLOCs, the second generation is designed with 

improved shape, which saves energy consumption by 19% 

under the same speed and draught. The VLOC is also LNG 

ready, with space and other elements equipped for potential 

alteration for LNG-fuelled engines and fuel storage.

“We are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last 

generation who can do something about it.”

R&amp;D BREAKTHROUGH TO LOWER PAINT VOCS

The Group participates in research initiatives led by global 

leaders to eliminate hazards in the industry. In recent years, 

its effort to reduce workplace exposure to volatile organic 

compounds has borne fruit.

For example, paints are anti-corrosion agents in shipbuilding. 

Surface preparation, paint, and other protective coatings 

used in shipbuilding and ship repair pose a hazard to 

workers. Potentially harmful substances can enter the body 

through inhalation, ingestion, and contact with the eyes or 

skin. The Three-Year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky 

Defence War released by the PRC State Council in July 2018 

creates an action plan to reduce 2015 VOC emissions by 

10% by 2020.

The Group has a long time relationship with Jotun Coatings, 

the marine anti-fouling coating arm of a leading chemicals 

company based in Norway. In 2017, Yangzi Xinfu Yard’s joint 

R&amp;D findings with Jotun to reduce emissions from volatile 

organic compounds (“VOC”) found in paints were published 

in the leading PRC academic journal, China Paint. It has 

applied this new coating method to the construction of its 

VLOC vessels. The breakthrough was so significant that the 

new method has gradually been adopted as an industry 

protocol. 

In summary, this finding had the following contribution to 

the industry:

• Significantly decrease the production cycle time in 

coating work, thereby decreasing worker exposure to 

VOC.

• Significantly decrease the VOC emission level in paints 

used at Yangzijiang.

• Reduce the use of raw materials.

• Protect the environment.

• Reduce the Group’s emission of pollutants.

• Reduce the cost of handling hazardous waste.

R&amp;D INVESTMENT

Accountability in Energy Consumption

The Group has a comprehensive appraisal system on 

equipment maintenance and energy saving. Every production 

worker is held responsible for the proper upkeep of the 

equipment that he handles. Punitive action is also taken 

against the line manager, district manager and equipment 

manager if rules are breached.

Water Usage 

Water is an important and scarce resource, especially 

in China where water pollution has affected 90% of the 

groundwater in our cities. The Group has the following 

procedures to protect its natural water resources:

• Responsible disposal of hazardous waste

• Conservation of water used for drinking and in toilets

construction and help the company rationalize its cost on 

electricity. The power storage station is expected to save 

close to RMB 1 million in electricity costs every year.

11 - WORKPLACE SAFETY

Yangzijiang put continued efforts in improving workplace 

safety in 2019, and here are some highlights of such actions 

at various divisions: 

• Annual complimentary health check-up for employees 

• Emergency drills and machinery/equipment inspection 

at all relevant divisions throughout the year, especially 

ahead of rainy season and summer heat 

• Thorough monthly inspection at each division to 

identify safety hazards 

• In 2019, the Group set up an additional clinic (cum. 

pharmacy). Now the Group has two clinics on its 

premise, one major yard each.

There were no fatal or major accidents at the Group in 2019. 

The overall incidence of small accidents and injuries declined 

in 2019 compared to 2018. 

Heatstroke Prevention 

The Group has a comprehensive heatstroke prevention 

program every summer to minimize accidents. The 

program includes:

• Clear assignment of accountability on each risk item;

• Constant monitoring of temperature and flexible 

working schedules;

• An emergency plan that is reviewed and refined 

regularly, which also specifies the reporting 

mechanism;

• Frequent and regular talks and review on safety 

production in morning and weekly meetings;

• Provide sufficient salted water and cooling medical 

supplements for workers;

• Requires that at least two workers are working 

together (in each other’s sight) at all times, counting 

staff every day after work, closely monitor the physical 

state of workers (no workers of inadequate working 

state are allowed on the production premise), requires 

all workers to have 10-15 minutes break for every one 

hour of work, etc.

In addition, cooling buckets and towels are placed in the 

engine rooms for workers to use.

Fire Drills 

The Group conducts regular fire drills at its major yards. 

The fire drill includes six procedures – alarm, evacuation, 

firefighting, security, medial rescue, and performance review.





Jun 2019

Workplace safety and fire prevention campaign 

throughout June 

Representatives of Jinjiang Emergency Rescue Bureau joined 

Yangzijiang’s fire drill on 19 June 2019. The fire drill was 

conducted in a scenario of one vessel under construction 

catching fire. The fire drill covered the entire rescue process, 

including reporting, evacuation, firefighting, and damage 

control. Responsible teams from the Group’s all three major 

yards attended.

Dust Removal 

To decrease debris from greater construction volumes and more cutting machinery at its production premises, the Group 

invested RMB 1 million to purchase more dust removal equipment in 2018. Visibility at the production workshop premise 

improved significantly and the processed emissions met the regulatory requirement once the dust removal system was in use.

AN UNUSUAL TIME - FIGHTING COVID-19 

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China since late January 2020, work resumption after the Chinese New Year 

was delayed for a few weeks while all at Yangzijiang made their best efforts in fighting the spread of the virus. Yangzijiang 

received heartwarming support from the local government and business partners, and at the same time, it gave back to society 

with its own contributions.





Mayor of Jingjiang City visits Yangzijiang and gives guidance 

and support on the prevention measures and preparation 

for work resumption.









Yangzijiang received several batches of donations of protection 

gears from various local government authorities and its joint-

venture partner, Mitsui of Japan.
