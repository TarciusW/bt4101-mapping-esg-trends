How OAP program improves your experience and knowledge? 

 

 

 

 

 

“OAP Trainee program have given myself the opportunity to explore end-to-end production flow in our 

factory and the chance to learn from our seniors with their extensive background in this industry. I felt 

challenged with the new environment that I'm placed in, having to interact, collaborate and work 

together with other people from different background and characteristic to solve different tasks. I am 

thankful for my mentors whom have guided me in dealing with obstacles, continuously giving me 

support and encouragement throughout this program. I hope I will be able to give back to Sampoerna 

Kayoe by working hard and implementing all the knowledge I gained during this trainee years. We as 

OAP trainees are now holding the baton to continue striving for Sampoerna Kayoe’s success in the 

future.”

“OAP program is designed to shape us trainees into future leaders through a focused and accelerated 

method of learning. The past four months into the program I have gained new knowledge and experience in 

the plywood industry by learning the overall manufacturing process and its details, as well as practicing on 

my communication and cooperation skills that are paramount in ensuring organization goals are achieved. 

The passion and dedication of our mentors, supervisors and colleagues in helping us to learn is a great fuel 

for us and boost our courage to complete this program in the best manner possible
