1 BOARD STATEMENT 

VibroPower Corporation Limited is pleased to issue its sustainability report in line with the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) guidelines on Sustainability Reporting.  

This report highlights the progress and achievements of our organisation over the past 12 months, 

with particular focus on our commitment to working alongside our valued stakeholders to build a 

sustainable business based on our resilience, adaptability and innovation.  

Sustainability is integral to our core business objectives. We are focusing our efforts on addressing 

the material issues about Future Generation, Employee, Customer, Supplier, Community and other 

stakeholders in order to embed sustainability in our business and operations. 

Throughout this sustainability report, we place emphasis on transparency. We hope to reflect our 

position accurately and bring our customers, staff, suppliers and many other stakeholders on this 

journey towards a more sustainable future. We firmly believe that building a sustainable business is 

vital to our continued success and that we must be fully accountable for our impact on the 

environment, our customers, our people and our community as well as its financial performance.  

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our ability to remain a strong and financially 

stable company. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to principles laid out in 

our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable 

practices are incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the needs not only of 

our customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also those of our environment and 

our future generations.

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. The report 

is designed to provide a transparent and balanced view of the company, to reflect the interests of 

our key stakeholders, and to address those interests pragmatically. This report aims to include 

comprehensive and accessible information on the company’s strategy towards sustainability, key 

issues as well as data according to recognized standards.  

2.1 Report Scope 

The report covers the performance of our consolidated entities in the financial year 2019 (FY2019) 

from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. The report content focuses on the sustainability 

performance, activities and initiatives that are under our direct control, including our Singapore 

offices and operations, our local supply chain as well as any overseas activities directly associated 

with us. Material issues and topics described in this report have been selected according to their 

significance within the company boundaries, the sustainability context and the expectations of the 

stakeholders. Our material operations are mainly in Singapore. The scope and all material topics 

disclosed in this report are relevant to the activities in Singapore. Nevertheless, our corporate 

governance and sustainability approaches are drawn from the policies and practices set at the Group 

level. 

This sustainability report focuses on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices whilst 

highlighting the economic, environmental, and social and governance aspects of our activities and 

developments. The report aims to provide an overview of our approach, priorities and targets, as 

well as a performance review for our key sustainability areas.  

2.2 Report Methodology 

We have prepared our report based on the requirements of the ‘In accordance-Core’ option of the 

Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) Standards Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. We have chosen the 

GRI Standards as the reporting guidelines for its robust guidance which offers an international 

reference for the disclosure of governance approach and of the environmental, social and economic 

performance and impacts of organizations. This report also takes into consideration the primary 

components of report content as set out by the Singapore Stock Exchange’s (SGX’s) “Comply or 

Explain” requirements for sustainability reporting. Our data are reported in good faith and to the 

best of our knowledge. We continue to improve our data collection processes.  

We did not seek external assurance for this report. 

2.3 Report Structure 

This Sustainability Report is structured to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders. We have 

identified five key stakeholder groups, namely, the environment and future generations, employees, 

customers, suppliers and communities. For each stakeholder group, we lay out our management 

approaches that govern how our material issues are identified as well as how the issues are 

prioritized and managed. Further, we will present our initiatives relating to sustainability in the areas 

of environmental, social and economic issues relevant to our topics and boundaries. Finally, we will 

provide the information of our key performance indicators, performance targets and outcomes. 

The information regarding the basis for report boundaries and our materiality assessment is 

provided in section 4.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

We believe corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. Such 

responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the core values in our 

corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes across the value 

chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. Through our action today, we play a 

part in influencing the environment for our future generations. Through integrating the notion of 

sustainability in our business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are in line with a 

long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainable future. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

We have established our sustainability reporting framework since January 2017. We performed an 

analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder mapping and 

materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder groups within our 

sustainability context and their respective material issues are to be shown in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) topics. Key to this is a regular Risk Assessment (RA) exercise which entails the 

identification, assessment and documentation of material risks and corresponding internal controls. 

Such material risks include fraud and corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human 

capital risks which are ESG-relevant. We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness 

of our Risk Assessment process in response to changing business and operation environment. 

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority is given to 

issues important to the society and those applicable to us. Then, we prioritize our sustainability 

efforts and report issues that are most material to its business and stakeholders. Considering that 

specific stakeholders and material issues are specific in countries and locations, we are reporting the 

stakeholder engagement and material issues for our Singapore operations in this report.

relations with suppliers and channel partners to 

enhance both their own competitiveness and 

that of ours.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (UN), the General Assembly occupies a 

central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United 

Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for 

multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also 

plays a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable 

development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years. Although 

the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important opportunity for 

businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the guiding principles 

for our sustainability initiatives. 

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals.

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our GHG 

emissions and set reduction targets.

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We believe that good CSR practice goes hand-in-hand with good corporate management practice. 

We also recognize that it is vital that our management approaches are adaptable to the dynamics of 

business and operation environment in such a way that we can continuously assess our impacts, 

develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner to meet our stakeholders’ 

expectations. Our CSR framework is based on our approach to sustainability and includes policies 

and measurement mechanisms to monitor the impacts made by our businesses and operations. 

Key to the success of our sustainability programme is through regular and up-to-date 

communication about our CSR policies and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of 

appropriate feedback mechanisms so that we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and 

explore new possibilities stimulated by stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability reports as 

being a critical component of this continuous cycle of communication and evaluation. The overall 

sustainability context of the stakeholder engagements is managed through our CSR plan for our 

sustainability governance oversight.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 

Our Approach 

We are committed to maintain and build on the stringent environmental policies and standards. We 

continually seek new and innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products and 

services while maintaining the highest levels of quality. We recognise our responsibility to protect 

the environment for the health and wellbeing of the future generations.  

5.1.2 

Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that effective management and monitoring of carbon footprint can reduce operating 

costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon 

footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. However, GHG emission is an 

absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is 

predominantly direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emission, and we do not include the GHG 

emissions generated by our suppliers (Scope 3). 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a 

target for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 15% from base year 2017 level by 2030. 

Although various business lines and operations account for different percentage of GHG emissions 

across the organization, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental objectives 

accordingly.  

In FY2019, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 61.0. In comparison to previous year 2018, it 

increased by 125.9%.

5.1.3 

Reduction of Paper Consumption 

All our employees are urged to minimize paper wastage at work by adhering to our Internal Paper 

Usage Reduction Guidelines. For example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage 

paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used for printing 

drafts. Paper re-use and recycling habits are also cultivated through initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the copy machines. 

We encourage all employees to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to 

further reduce paper consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set 

a target for a paper consumption improvement of 15% from base year 2017 level by 2030. Although 

various business lines and operations account for different percentage of paper consumption across 

the organization, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental objectives 

accordingly.  

In FY2019, we consumed total of 574kg of paper, 100% of which are Programme for the 

Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) certified. Our paper consumption index stands at 52.0 

which increased by 160% compared to previous year 2018.

5.1.4 

Promoting Green Practices  

Currently, we need to embrace various green practices in our business and operation such as 

Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). 

The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is an international non-profit, 

non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) 

through independent third-party certification. PEFC is effective throughout the timber supply chain 

to ensure that forest product production respects ecological, social and ethical standards. Using 

PEFC provides a mark of trust for customers and consumers to identify products from sustainably 

managed forests. Our company is using PEFC certified forest products, whereby we purchase A4 

paper with PEFC logo.

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 

Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and development is 

vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, which 

are in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the foundation upon which we build 

all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day activities.   

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all our key 

stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the members of the community. By attracting, 

nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment conducive for 

innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our competitiveness. Such commitment to our 

employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence and trust within the 

organization which reflect in our ability to create values to our stakeholders. 

Our Human Resource (HR) management principles and policies have been developed and 

established based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, developing and retaining 

a robust motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, staff 

selection, career development and training. Such policies are communicated to all employees 

through our comprehensive Employee Handbook which is regularly reviewed by our management 

and we constantly seek feedback from our staff to ensure that our decisions are aligned as much as 

possible with their needs. 

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and geographic 

locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the organization within the 

principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing laws and regulations as well 

as local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

5.2.2 

Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximizing the strength of our employees by providing equal 

opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through our 

comprehensive training and development programme. We regularly review the competency gap and 

development of our employees to effectively match their strength to their job specifications. Our 

performance based reward scheme provides guidance and motivation to our employees to perform 

to their potentials in alignment with the objectives of the company.  

5.2.2.1 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

We proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are guided by 

the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore 

Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation 

and National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has formulated guidelines on fair 

employment practice for adoption by Singapore employers, embracing the recruitment, training, 

treatment and reward of employees.  

5.2.2.2 

Communications  

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organization are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organizational objectives. We achieve 

this through our various communication sessions customized based on the target employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. Agendas covered at these 

sessions are customized in appropriate to the target functional scope of the managers. For example, 




 

 

Sustainability Report  



Page 21 of 39 

 



in monthly managers’ meeting, operational agendas such as leadership and operation issues may be 

discussed while at the quarterly sessions high level topics include strategic business directions, new 

service launches, ongoing developments and key project reviews.  

5.2.2.3 

Employee feedback  

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks are 

important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the organization. Through 

various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee objective setting, 

performance review as well as exit interview in case of resignations, we gather such valuable 

feedbacks for the continuous improvement of our organization. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as 

whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by the 

leaders and managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also established 

reporting and escalation channel should the feedback requires the attention of higher management. 

5.2.2.4 

Career Development and Training 

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintain a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance management 

are established based on merits and contributing skill sets towards the organization objectives 

through objective settings and regular performance reviews. We continue to review and improve 

our people development and learning process in light of the changing business and operation 

environment. 

Our training programmes cover a variety of areas catering for employees with difference job scopes 

and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are developed and guided by 

well-established industry and international standards. In addition, specific training curriculums are 

developed based on the specific requirements of the specific businesses and functions. Training 

topics range from soft skills development in areas such as communications and leadership, to 

technical programmes covering project management and office productivity tools.  

In FY2019, each employee received an average of 1.0 hours of training. We recognized that the 

training requirements vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Non-managerial 

staffs received an average of 1.5 hours of training. In light of changing business requirements and 

opportunities in variety of training methodologies, we continue to revise our training curriculum and 

programme to align with the organization objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in 

our training approach.

5.2.3 

Workforce Diversity 

Our business thrives on diversity. As such, we leverage on a host of strengths and skills that can only 

come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, religion, age and 

gender.  

In FY2019, 14 of our employees were male, comprising 56% of our workforce, while 11 (44%) 

employees were female. In terms of management function, 2 male (50%) held senior management 

position compared to 2 female (50%), 3 male (60%) held managerial position compared to 2 female 

(40%), while 9 male (56%) and 7 female (44%) held non-managerial positions. The male to female

5.2.4 

Employee Benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides 

basic employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, 

hours of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

5.2.4.1 

Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to excel 

are the key drivers for our company, we also recognize that the well-being and contentment of our 

employees are pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and performance. Our 

employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their overall well-beings need to be 

well looked after in order for them to sustain their performance and realize their full potential.  

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we aim to create an environment that allows 

our employees to achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We intend to adopt a 

flexible approach to work arrangements and offering programmes to support health and wellness.  

We understand that workplace could be at times stressful due to the competitiveness of our 

workforce and our business. To support our employees in their effort of pursuing excellence, we will 

launch various programmes and initiatives to balance their work with fun, and to development an 

environment and culture of mutual support.

5.2.4.2 

Retirement and Healthcare  

Our company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and 

regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with 

such laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) personal 

savings scheme, which helps employees fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and 

education. Under this scheme, monthly deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their 

CPF savings accounts. We, the company, make employer contributions to these accounts, according 

to the rates stipulated in the CPF Act. In addition to CPF contributions, we provide comprehensive 

medical coverage for all employees. For more information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates, 

please go to www.cpf.gov.sg.  

5.2.5 

Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to workplace safety and health and we take every precaution to prevent 

occupational injuries among our employees. We believe that optimum work conditions not only 

make our employees safer, but also boost morale. We are in compliance with the Ministry of 

Manpower’s Workplace Safety and Health Act in Singapore.  

5.2.6 

Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations and this is deeply 

ingrained in our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, and 

workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the work environment and 

discrimination and harassment of any kind is not tolerated at our company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership of 

trade unions and other professional bodies.  

In FY2019, 0% of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of 

forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human 

rights-related grievances have been reported.

5.3 Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs 

5.3.1 

Our Approach 

Customer service, quality products and the highest level of product safety have always been our 

priorities, with customer satisfaction being the goal of all our corporate activities. Customer trust 

and retention starts with our people and products, we place the utmost importance on training our 

employees in customer service excellence and in continuously striving to improve the quality and 

safety of our products and services.  

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily activities 

with customer interaction. In addition to striving for excellence in product service and support, we 

attach enormous importance to data privacy. We have process and controls in place over 

confidential and sensitive data related to our customers such as contracts. 

Since 1998, we have been certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management systems. 

The certification has helped us increase the control of our internal processes and the quality of our 

services.  

5.3.2 

Customer Feedback and Satisfaction 

We consistently listen to the voice of our customers and take their opinions very seriously because 

their opinion is a resource for improving customer experience and adjusting company’s actions to 

their needs. We consolidate customer feedback through a range of communication channels 

including feedback to sales personnel and regular customer survey. Customer satisfaction and 

loyalty are crucial factors that determine the company’s financial performance. These are directly 

linked to many benefits, such as increased market share, lower costs, or higher revenue. 

5.3.3 

Product Quality and Safety 

We are trying to provide customers with the high-safety products by promoting enterprise quality 

activities and quality awareness because reliability and quality of our products are of paramount 

importance to us. Ultimately, we aim to totally eliminate product safety incidents so as to foster a 

‘Safety First’ culture through employee training and quality control.  

5.3.4 

Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers such as contracts, customer orders and product delivery orders. Our information security 

policies ensure our customers’ data are managed in accordance to the level of confidentiality. We 

strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information protection.

5.4 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

As a part of our ambition to realize sustainability throughout our value chain, we extend the 

application of responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We recognise that 

we are only at the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice throughout 

our supply chain, and we commit in our pragmatic approach to continuous improvement. We aim to 

identify new opportunities for collaboration with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and 

continue to build shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.4.2 

Supplier Selection 

Our key suppliers are carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When selecting our 

key suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services, 

competitiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into consideration of the overall sustainability 

policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision on supplier selection is based on the overall 

assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria. 

5.4.3 

Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key suppliers to 

communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process ensures alignment of our 

key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements and sustainability objectives 

through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our partnership with our key suppliers.

5.5 Supporting for Our Community 

5.5.1 

Our Approach 

We have been providing support to the community. The key motivation driving all our community 

engagement initiatives is to enable and empower young people. By supporting young people today 

and helping to educate them about the world they are to inherit, our goal is to benefit not only the 

current generation, but also the next.  

We also recognize that meeting the needs of today’s youth goes beyond their own education, 

security and well-being, extending to that of their families, homes and neighbourhoods as well.  

Our community initiatives are selected according to how closely they are aligned with our own 

community engagement goals of “enabling and empowering young people” and the tangible impact 

on the beneficiary. Separately, we also engage on other community initiatives on an ad hoc basis.  

5.5.2 

Our Community Initiatives  

We are planning to engage in community services in the forthcoming years in order to strengthen 

and build a capable and sustainable community continuously.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions as measure in GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and 

kilowatt Hours (kWh), from electricity and fuel consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are 

both from non-renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. To 

ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures 

over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of 

our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is 

measured in t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per 

SGD million.

This year GHG emission index stands at 61 t-CO2/million SGD, an increase of 125.9% as 

compared to the target and FY2018 result, the reason for the increase is due to sales 

dropped in FY2019. 

 

Electricity consumption index stands at 16,780 kWh/million SGD, 20.4% increase compared 

to the target and FY2018 result, the reason for the increase is due to decrease in sales in 

FY2019. 

 

We will thrive to sustain our performance towards our 2030 goals.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper 

sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight of paper used 

which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per SGD million.
