BOARD STATEMENT 

 

We are pleased to present the Sustainability Report of Yinda Infocomm Limited (“Yinda Infocomm”, 

or the “Company” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 May 

2020 (“FY2020”). This report is prepared in compliance with the Rules 711A and 711B of the Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-

ST”)(“Catalist Rules”), and is referenced to the guidance set out in SGX-ST’s Sustainability Reporting 

Guide under Practice Note 7F of the Catalist Rules. This Sustainability Report is prepared based on 

the Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option. We have chosen to 

report using the GRI Standards because it is an internationally recognised reporting framework that 

covers a comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures.  

 

This report highlights the key economic, environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) related 

initiatives carried throughout the 12-month period, from 1 June 2019 to 31 May 2020. For this report, 

we will be focusing on our sustainability approach, initiatives and performance in respect of the Group’s 

operations in Singapore. The Group intends to expand the scope of its sustainability report in the future 

to include its sustainability practices in other geographical regions, including Thailand and Philippines 

as the Group expands in those markets. The Group adopts the precautionary principle to minimise 

negative effects of conducting its business whenever feasible.  

 

Sustainability is a part of the Group’s wider strategy to create long-term value for all its stakeholders. 

As such, the key material EESG factors for the Group have been identified and cautiously reviewed 

by the management. The data and information provided have not been verified by an independent 

third party. We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure the accuracy of the 

data and information provided. Where required and as the Group’s sustainability reporting matures, 

the Group will consider seeking external independent assurance for its sustainability report. The Board 

of Directors (the “Board” or “Directors”) oversees the management and monitoring of the material 

EESG factors affecting the Group and considers them in the determination of the Group’s strategic 

direction and policies while the key management team are responsible for the implementation of 

sustainability initiatives.  

 

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as this enables 

us to consistently improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments and 

suggestions to contact@yinda.com.sg.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

 

Our sustainability reporting process begins with the identification of relevant EESG factors. Such factors 

are then prioritised to identify material factors which are subjected to validation. The end result of this 

process is a list of material factors disclosed in the Sustainability Report. Processes are as shown below: 

 

 

The Group has conducted a materiality assessment during the year. We engaged our employees from 

different departments and sought their feedback for ranking of these topics according to priority. 

Materiality review is conducted every year, incorporating inputs gathered from stakeholders’ 

engagements. 

 

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and its influence on the stakeholders. Applying the guidance from GRI, we 

have identified the following as our material aspects:

ECONOMIC 

 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  

The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 has caused severe disruption to the global economy and 

business. As governments worldwide have been taking various measures to battle the spread of the 

virus, this inevitably has an enormous impact on our telecommunication industry and our Group’s 

operations.  

Yinda Infocomm firmly believes that focusing on financial sustainability is critical and we are fully 

committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Group’s basic principle is to ensure 

long-term profitability and shareholders’ value is ensured by taking into account the interests of all 

stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, suppliers and society as a whole. 

 

In the face of unprecedented, difficult and challenging market conditions for the telecommunications 

industry in Singapore, for the financial year ended 31 May 2020, the Group recorded a much lower 

revenue of S$11.5 million as compared to S$17.9 million (restated) in the financial year ended 31 May 

2019 representing a decrease of S$6.4 million or 35.7%. 

 

Revenue for FY2020 decreased mainly from (i) the Telecommunication Implementation (“TI”) projects 

of S$5.6 million in Singapore, partially offset by an increase in revenue contributions from Philippines 

and Thailand of S$0.1 million and S$0.8 million respectively; (ii) increase in Networking Planning 

Optimisation (“NPO”) projects of S$0.5 million in Singapore, partially offset by a decrease in 

contributions from Philippines and Thailand of $0.5 million and $0.2 million respectively; and decrease 

in In-Building Construction (“IBC”) projects in Singapore, Philippines and Thailand of approximately 

S$1.0 million, S$0.2 million and S$0.3 million respectively. 

 

FUTURE PROSPECTS  

With the entrance of a fourth telecommunications operator and the transition of Singapore to a digital 

economy, the Group continues to look out for opportunities in the telecommunications space while at 

the same time, remaining cautious amid the prevailing economic uncertainties.  

In addition, the Group is actively taking steps to manage its costs and streamline its business processes 

so as to achieve cost and operational optimisation. 

The Group will continue to focus its efforts on servicing its existing customers based in Singapore, 

Thailand and the Philippines. 

 

For detailed financial results, please refer to our FY2020 Annual Report, pages 51 to 110.

REGIONAL PRESENCE  

Our presence in these markets nurtures our ability to adapt to diverse operating conditions, enabling us 

to respond quickly to the changing needs and requirements of our customers and secure projects on 

providing solutions and services beyond Singapore. Through our regional business networks, we are 

able to enjoy economies of scale which allows us to provide cost-effective solutions and services to our 

customers.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

We do not tolerate corruption in any form and strive to conduct our business with utmost integrity and 

transparency. This has been made clear to all of the Group’s Directors, officers and employees. The 

Directors and senior management team have attended the relevant trainings provided by Singapore 

Institute of Directors which inculcated business ethics and integrity.  Our whistleblowing email was set 

up so that anyone who wants to report any issue on corruption can do so confidentially. Any report of 

corruption will be escalated to the attention of the Audit Committee (“AC”). 

Similar to FY2019, there were no reported incidents of corruption in FY2020.   

 

Whistleblowing Policy 

The Group has implemented a whistleblowing policy. The policy aims to provide an avenue for 

employees and external parties to raise concerns about misconduct or improprieties in the Group and 

at the same time assure them that they will be protected from victimisation for whistleblowing in good 

faith. Significant cases are reviewed by the AC for adequacy of investigation actions and resolutions. 

The Company has provided the email address – whistleblow@yinda.com.sg which is accessible by the 

Lead Independent Director on the Company’s website to allow external parties to raise any concerns 

they may have. 

 

We have achieved zero whistleblowing cases in FY2020 and in FY2019. 

 

We have achieved our target to maintain zero incidences of corruption. We will continue to regularly 

review our whistleblowing and anti-corruption policies.

ENVIRONMENTAL  

Yinda Infocomm endeavors to minimise the potential impact of our operations on the environment. We 

are committed to reduce any carbon footprint and consumption of natural resources in all possible 

aspects of business operations. We encourage the use of renewable materials and resources, and 

where possible, reduce waste through reusing and recycling. We avoid any unnecessary use of 

hazardous materials and products and take all reasonable steps to protect the environment when such 

materials must be used, stored or disposed of.  

 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  

Here at Yinda Infocomm, we view compliance with relevant codes and regulations on environmental 

issues as mandatory. The Group has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure 

compliance with the relevant laws and regulations and prevent environmental pollution and resource 

depletion with due diligence. We have compiled a Legal &amp; Other Requirements Register for relevant 

legal and other requirements that the Group needs to comply with. For example, we are in compliance 

with the Environmental Public Health Act and Regulations, Environmental Protection and Management 

Act and Regulations and Smoking Act. We have taken steps at all worksites to ensure the requirements 

are met throughout the duration of the projects. 

 

In FY2020 we have achieved our target of zero incidences of non-compliance with laws, environmental 

rules and regulations resulting in significant fines or sanctions (FY2019: nil). We will aim to continue full 

compliance with all environmental rules and regulations.  

 

SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 

Yinda Infocomm will continue to reduce its environmental impact and encourage its stakeholders, such 

as suppliers and trading partners, to meet the same expectations. The Group also performs an 

assessment when screening new vendors to check that they are providing high quality and green 

products. The procurement team is responsible for gathering and verifying information on new suppliers 

in terms of quality of products and services, having resources to meet requirements, responsiveness of 

the vendor or subcontractors, product certification and records, et cetera.  

 

The Group aspires to continuously promote and integrate sustainability in our business operations and 

taking stakeholders’ interest in our consideration. EESG factors are integrated into our value and supply 

chain as our sustainability efforts progressively mature. Moreover, Yinda Infocomm pledges to uphold 

sustainable business practices across its supply chain, from our subsidiaries to suppliers.  

 

 






 

10 

 



The Group trusts that sustainable supply chain management drives organisational excellence and 

delivers desirable business results to the stakeholders. This includes completion of supplier evaluation 

procedure to reduce the risk that a supplier’s products do not meet the Company’s requirements. We 

will perform assessment on new major suppliers to ensure that suppliers for important 

telecommunications equipment or materials are selected in accordance to their conduct and to ensure 

the stability of the supply of goods to further reduce the procurement risks. 

 

There was no assessment performed as there were no new major suppliers this financial year. Going 

forward, our target is to ensure that all new major suppliers will be screened and selected in accordance 

to their conduct which can be evaluated against an environmental assessment.

SOCIAL 

Our employees are our greatest assets. Their contributions and support are valued at all times. As such, 

we conduct regular reviews on compensations and benefits policies according to the industry 

benchmark, financial results as well as individual performance of employees. Other fringe benefits and 

pension funds contributions are provided to retain loyal employees with the aim to form a professional 

staff and management team that can bring the Group to new levels of success. Furthermore, the Group 

places great emphasis on the training and development of employees and regards excellent employees 

as a key factor in remaining competitive. 

We respect human rights and support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour, 

especially child labour. The Group does not tolerate any discrimination in respect of employment and 

occupation. 

 

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

A diverse workforce is an asset in today's ever-changing global marketplace. We cultivate an inclusive 

culture where employees with wide-ranging backgrounds and qualities are highly motivated, engaged 

and connected. We do not discriminate against one’s race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, disability or 

nationality.  

 

As of 31 May 2020, we had a workforce of 77 (FY2019: 110) full-time, permanent employees for our 

operations in Singapore. Our headcounts were distributed as follows:

The Group’s gender diversity gap is relatively wide but this is not unusual for our industry due to the 

nature of the business. 

Our recruitment of staff is based solely on merit and qualifications, without discrimination of race, age, 

gender, religion or ethnicity. There was no non-compliance incident reported in the current year, as 

targeted. We will continue to aim to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance of manpower related 

rules and regulations, as well as complaints. 

 

To promote equal opportunity, we have implemented various human resource measures as follows:  

Staff Assessment

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  

We are committed to safeguard our employees’ health and safety against any potential workplace 

hazards. Ensuring our employees’ safety and health in the workplace is one of our top priorities, and 

our ultimate target is to have a zero-accident workplace. We are committed to reduce any risks related 

to safety and health through effective risk management. 

The Group has recorded zero workplace fatality and non-fatal workplace injuries in FY2020 and in 

FY2019, as targeted. We will continuously work towards reducing both the occurrence and severity of 

workplace accidents. 

We have set up a Health and Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) Committee and established a strict 

set of policies and procedures. We have also developed and implemented an HSE Management 

System, and will continuously monitor and evaluate our HSE standards. 

 

 










 

15 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Company’s latest detailed HSE policy 

statement detailed the Company’s commitment 

to promote a safe workplace as well as an 

environmental friendly culture through effective 

communication and participation with the 

employees. In addition to the HSE policy 

statement, 

the 

Company 

has 

detailed 

Workplace Safety and Security Clauses are 

stated in the HSE Management System Manual 

and Procedure. This covers a standard 

procedure to identify hazards relating to HSE, 

to evaluate risks associated with these hazards 

and to ensure that appropriate actions by the 

designated personnel are taken to manage the 

risks involved, such as incident reporting, 

management of incident, investigation and 

follow up. 

 

 

Yinda Infocomm makes continuous efforts in investing on internal and external training to raise the 

employees’ awareness and develop their skills to ensure safe operations.  

 

In FY2020, the Company has made an initiative to increase the employee’s awareness by doing HSE 

Promotional Program Crossword Contest and five winners were selected for those who answer correctly. 

Videos on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (“CPR”) procedure and managing stress at work were shared 

to all employees on 26 June 2020 and participate in crossword contest.

GOVERNANCE 

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

We believe that strong governance is the key to a sustainable business. The Board and Management

Yinda Infocomm regularly updates key staff on developments in international and local regulations. We 

are fully compliant with all environmental rules and regulations, confidentiality clauses, anti-competitive 

behaviour laws and all requirements on health and safety.  

 

Cyber security and data privacy are not only important for compliance, but also in safeguarding both 

our data and that of our customers. We have taken measures to guard against cyber risks for both our 

internal and external stakeholders by complying with the Personal Data Protection Act Policy. This 

policy also applies to our employment process where the privacy of all applicants is safeguarded and 

access to personal data are restricted to authorised persons or senior management on a need-to-know 

basis. 

We have achieved our target set in FY2019 as there were no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions 

for non-compliance with laws and regulations in both years. We will continue to maintain and ensure no 

significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations.  

 

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  

The Board acknowledges its responsibilities for the overall internal control framework and governance 

of risk, ensuring that the management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal 

controls to safeguard the interests of the Company and its shareholders.  

The Board, assisted by the AC, reviews annually and ensures that a sound system of risk management 

and internal controls is maintained by the Group to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the Group’s 

assets and determines the nature and extent of the significant risks which the Group is willing to take 

in achieving its strategic objectives. The Group has implemented a system of internal controls designed 

to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, proper accounting records are 

maintained operational controls are adequate and business risks are suitably managed. The Board, 

with the assistance of the AC, oversees the management in the design, implementation and monitoring 

of the risk management and internal control systems, and reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of 

such systems at least annually.  

We have ensured timely and proper implementation of internal control measures as targeted in FY2019. 

Going forward, we target to review our risk management and internal control systems annually to ensure 

their adequacy.
