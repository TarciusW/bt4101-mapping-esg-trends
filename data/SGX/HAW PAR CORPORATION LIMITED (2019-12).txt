4. CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

Delivering health and wellness to communities in which we operate is the focus of our initiatives to 

contribute to the society. In 2019, we continued with our heritage of providing Tiger Balm products to 

those in need.  

  

We believe that no one should be constrained from leading an active life, and sport is a force for 

wellbeing and empowerment. Since 2015, Haw Par has been supporting athletes from Singapore 

Disability Sports Council (SDSC). Going beyond sponsorship of broad based competitions, Haw Par 

provides a Sports Bursary to help financially-marginalised athletes to sustain their sports 

development, enabling more to live healthier and active lives. In 2019, Haw Par sponsored the 

Singapore Disability Sports Awards to recognise the achievements of the athletes and the community 

behind them.  

  

We recognise that healthy communities do largely depend on a healthy planet, which is in turn 

dependent on healthy ecosystems with rich biodiversity. Haw Par is a supporter of the United Nations 

Decade on Biodiversity 2011-2020 and our Blue Mission at Underwater World Pattaya aims to inspire, 

educate, conserve. As the tiger and leopard, listed among the most endangered species on Earth, are 

the namesakes of Haw Par and our company founders, we have been sponsoring the Malayan Tiger 

Exhibit and the Leopard Exhibit at the Night Safari and the Singapore Zoo since 1995 and 1986 

respectively.    

 

The United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 to achieve sustainable 

development for all by 2030. Haw Par contributes to five of the goals.
