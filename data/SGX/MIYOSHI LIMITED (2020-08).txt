Board Statement
The board of directors (the "Board") of Miyoshi Limited (the "Company" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group")
is pleased to present the fourth sustainability report for the Group's financial year ended 31 August 2020. It provides a
detailed account of our sustainability performance in all our operations.
Our 'tomorrow-focused' vision allows us to anticipate and address global trends that impact the way we live, work,
move and the food we eat. Miyoshi links business opportunities to important global trends to create long-term value
for our customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers and local communities. We understand that everything that we
do is connected to our stakeholders and environment, and that sustainability is smart business. We are putting our
best minds and technology to go beyond what is possible.
Sustainability in all forms - economic, environmental, social and governance -- is central to our strategy. Over
30 years, we strive to continue building a more sustainable and thriving Group. The Board, having considered
sustainability factors as part of its strategic formulation, determined the material economic, environmental, social and
governance ("EESG") factors and have overseen the management and monitoring of the material EESG factors.
As the global COVID-19 pandemic situation prolongs, the operating environment remains challenging and the Group
expects continued disruptions in the supply chain and supply of manpower. The Group has placed stringent measures
and procedures to prevent COVID-19 from affecting the factory and the production of our business units in the
Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and China.
We are committed to sustaining our leadership for our stakeholders and look forward to keeping them appraised of
our progress.

MIYOSHI LIMITED  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Sustainability Governance Structure
We approach sustainability by integrating it into our business to deliver long-term shareholder value and growth. We
believe that a truly sustainable business not only creates economic value, but does so in a way that benefits its
stakeholders and the environment.
Accountability for the best practices is in the hands of our Sustainability Strategy Committee ("ssC"), a group of
company executives across various functions. The ssc provide strategic direction for managing sustainability-related
risks and opportunities, and guides the development and improvement of frameworks, policies, guidelines and
processes to ensure that sustainability factors are effectively managed. The SsC comprise the Chief Executive Officer
("CEO"), Group Finance Manager and the respective heads of key departments of our business units (collectively, the
"Management").
About our Reporting
Our sustainability reporting is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") G4: Core Option as
it provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted as a global standard for sustainability reporting.
In defining our reporting content, we applied the GRI's principles by considering the Group's activities, impacts and
substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders. We observed a total of four principles, including materiality,
stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability index and completeness.
For reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability.
The EESG data and information provided have not been verified by an independent third party. We have relied on
 internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy.
External Charters, Principles or Other Initiatives
Miyoshi has aligned our operations and business practices with the industry practices and standards of International
Organization for Standards including IS09001, IATF16949 and ISO14001.

Our Materiality Analysis
Materiality analysis enables Miyoshi to define sustainability factors that are of greatest significance to our businesses
and stakeholders over the long term.
The SSC team identified the EESG factors material to the Group based on their knowledge of their respective
business areas, the challenges faced and the corresponding implications for Miyoshi's businesses and operations
The ssc team also considered the insights they gained from their day-to-day engagement with their stakeholders.
The identification of the material EESG factors were followed by extensive consultation with internal stakeholders,
including members of the management team, to establish the direction for sustainability reporting. The SSC also
examined the evaluation criteria applied by the relevant sustainability indices and rankings to understand the EESG
matters of interest to our stakeholders to ensure completeness. We considered the guiding principles from Practice
 Note 7F -- Sustainability Reporting Guide continued in the SGX-ST listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist.
Based on the above process, we categorised the identified EESG factors into three groups: Highly Material, Material
and Important. A summary of these factors, how we create value, our goals and how they relate to the GRI's aspects

Our Material EESG Factors
ENVIRONMENTAL
We are committed to reduce the environmental impacts of our activities, efficiently utilise natural resources and
reduce waste. Our focus is on materials, energy, water, sustainable packaging and waste.
At Miyoshi, we ensure that the principle of sustainable business is embedded in our activities and products. This
means protecting the future by making the right choices in an environment where water is increasingly scarce, natural
resources are constrained and biodiversity is declining.
Materials (metals/packaging materials), energy and water are irreplaceable inputs of many of our production and
consumption processes. Environmental concerns on metal mining include physical disturbances to the landscape, soil
and water contamination and air contamination. Energy sources also have some impact on our environment, including
wildlife and habitat loss, global warming emissions, air and water pollution. Optimisation of water use by our Group
is important because it can lower water withdrawals from local water sources thus increasing water availability and
improving community relations.
Measuring and managing the consumption of the materials, energy and water is not only important for our planet
and communities in which we operate, it is also essential to the sustainability of our business. We are committed to
minimising our environmental impact across our operations.
The Company has adopted electronic communication with shareholders and the Company is no longer required to
print and deliver physical copies of Annual Report and Circular for General Meetings. The objective is to reduce the
use of paper and save the environment. In FY2020, the Company has saved more papers from printing of notice of
Annual General Meeting on 28 December 2020 as companies are allowed to use electronic means of communication

Steel is a uniquely sustainable material because once
it is made, it can be used as steel forever. Steel is
infinitely recycled and the material can be used by
future generations. Steel is one of the most recycled
material in the world.
Steel waste or scrap, such as metal shavings, cut-
outs and debris, is nearly inevitable when cutting and

In FY2020, despite the decrease in materials consumed, we did not meet the target of 12% set in FY2019 partly
due to the fire incident reported on 28 May 2020 (the "Fire Incident") which resulted in higher scrap percentage of
materials.

Our Material EESG Factors
Energy and Water
Managing energy and water is important to our bottom

line and the environment. Our factories require energy
to operate and approximately 9,440 megawatt hours
10,299
9,284
9,440
(MWh) of electricity was consumed in FY2020.
Energy is consumed by our various equipment,
lighting systems, cooling/heating and ventilation
systems. Our approach towards energy is mainly
focused on the reduction of machine idling time. This
idling is due to the metal part queueing for quality
check before continuing production. Machine idling
leads to inefficiency and in turn increases the energy
consumption per part.

The lighting systems offer great opportunities for
savings. Adopting the latest fluorescent and Light

Water savings are achieved through a combination of
changing behaviour, modifying and replacing equipment
with water saving equipment to reduce overall water
consumption and increase internal reuse. Trainings
are also conducted to raise the awareness among
employees on efficient use of water and responsible
use. We conduct regular inspections of equipment or

areas where leaks could occur, such as piping joints,
FY2020
connections and fittings.
Target: To reduce up to 5% of energy and water
consumption from previous year.
Sustainable Packaging
One of the most overlooked sources of waste in the supply chain is packaging waste. Recognising that one-way
packaging supply chains result in an unacceptable amount of waste, Miyoshi has initiated a Returnable Packaging
program at our manufacturing sites in the Philippines, Thailand and China.
The economics of sustainable packaging is clear as reducing packaging waste creates efficiencies and lowers costs
of production. Re-using materials extend their life and helps to use less of the earth's precious resources. Recycling
allows us to repurpose valuable materials that would otherwise have been wasted. The more we reduce, re-use and
recycle, the greater the cost savings in packaging materials, transport and disposal.
In Miyoshi, we use cardboard boxes (recyclable) and plastic crates (reusable and recyclable) in our packaging and
they are usually placed on wooden and plastic pallets (recyclable and reusable).
Target: To increase the use of recyclable or reusable packaging materials.
In FY2020, the cost of packaging materials accounted for approximately 1.4% of Group's revenue. The Group will work
towards providing the quantitative data about the usage of recyclable or reusable packaging materials in FY2021.

Our Material EESG Factors
Workplace safety, health and well-being
Creating and sustaining a safety-focused, zero-incident culture is a top priority for everyone at Miyoshi. This
commitment starts with our CEO and permeates the entire organisation. At Miyoshi, everyone is responsible for their
own safety and the safety of their co-workers' safety. We promote open discussions with Management regarding work-
related hazards and safety issues. Our manufacturing sites conduct monthly environmental, health and safety (EHS)
meetings. These meetings raise awareness of safety compliance issues and provide our employees with opportunities
to share best practices.
At Miyoshi, we support our employees to live healthy lives and achieve peak performance. We emphasise on nutrition,
fitness, easy access to our health information and an environment that encourages healthy choices and personal
management of health risks.
In our manufacturing sites, we work with our canteen operators to provide meals based on healthier cooking methods,
such as ovens and grilling, instead of frying and to include more fibre in their diet, such as fruits and vegetables.
Target: To have zero work-related fatality and minimise the number of lost days due to injuries.
During FY2020, the Group has implemented Safe Management Measures in respect of the safety measures
requirements to curb the spread of COVID-19. This includes the use of virtual meetings, remote work arrangement
and dissemination of materials and articles from local authorities on health measures related to COVID-19 to our
employees.
Following the Fire Incident, the Group has taken actions to strengthen our fire safety management control system.
Measures such as regular inspections of fire safety equipment, periodic checks of electrical equipment, identifying fire
 hazards items and regularly providing and updating the fire awareness training for the employees.
There were no casualty or injuries caused by the Fire Incident.

Incident Investigations
In our drive to constantly improve our safety performance and share lessons learned, we are constantly strengthening
our incident investigation capabilities through training and support. Training sessions helps systematically analyse
the root causes of incidents and address measures preventing recurrence have been conducted in the Philippines,
Thailand, China and Malaysia. The Management and all employees have been alerted to the importance of workplace
safety and everyone plays a crucial part in preventing accidents from happening.

Our Material EESG Factors
Suppliers and Contractors
Suppliers and contractors are essential to our operations, especially in the core business. Therefore, we must make
the safety performance of contractors and suppliers a central concern. The selection process for suppliers and
contractors, especially for high-risk activities (such as electrical works or working at heights), includes the mandatory
participation of safety experts. Additionally, we also train the employees of suppliers and contractors in our practical
safety training courses at our various manufacturing locations.
Anti-Child Labour and Anti-Forced Labour
Miyoshi is against any form of coerced labour and discrimination, and adheres to the tenets of global human rights
conventions that include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation ("ILO")
Conventions. We comply with the five key principles of fair employment:
a. recruit and select employees on the basis of merit, such as skills, experience and ability, regardless of ethnicity,
gender, age or disability,
b. treat employees fairly and with respect and implement progressive human resource management systems,
c. provide employees with equal opportunities for training and development based on their strengths and needs, to
help them achieve their full potential,
d. reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience, and
e. abide by the local labour laws which promote fair employment practices.
In FY2020, there was no reported incident relating to child labour or forced labour in Miyoshi.
Respect for Freedom of Association
Miyoshi upholds employees' rights to freedom of association, including the right to be trade union members. In
permitting employees to be represented by trade union for collective bargaining, Miyoshi adheres to the Industrial
Relations Act. Working together in a mutual and cordial relationship, Miyoshi and the various union seek to foster
positive work environments and raise productivity. There were no employee health and safety concerns raised by the
 union in FY2020.
Community Investment
Our social responsibility vision extends to the involvement with the communities in which Miyoshi employees live and
work. Across the Asia Pacific region, Miyoshi supports the local communities on a personal level. Miyoshi assists its
employees in contributing both time and financial support to local non-profit groups and community organisations.
We participated in activities such as volunteering work, blood donation drives as well as tree planting. Our employee-
led volunteer Green Teams from Miyoshi Thailand take part in community projects that seek to help the environment.
increase capacity and enhance quality of life.
Target: To continue to introduce program that will benefit local communities.
In FY2020 prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, our team participated in the Community Outreach Programme in the
 Philippines and blood donation campaign in Thailand.

Our Material EESG Factors
GOVERNANCE: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY
We strive to achieve high standards of corporate governance, business integrity and professionalism to ensure
sustainability of the Company's businesses and performance as well as to safeguard shareholders' interests and
 maximise long-term shareholder value.
We adopt the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance 2o18 (the "Code") issued by the Monetary Authority of

SGTI Total score
The Singapore Governance Transparency Index ("SGTI") is a joint initiative of NUS Business School's Centre for
Governance, Institutions and Organizations ("CGIO"), Singapore Institute of Directors ("SID") and CPA Australia
to achieve the objective of evaluating listed companies, including REITs and business trusts, on their corporate
governance practices and disclosures, as well as the timeliness, accessibility and transparency of their financial
results.
The SGTI score has two components: the base score and the adjustment for bonuses and penalties. The base score
for companies contains five pillars of board responsibilities, rights of shareholders, engagement of stakeholders,
accountability and audit, and disclosure and transparency. The aggregate of bonuses and penalties is incorporated to
 the base score to arrive at the company's SGTI total score.
SGTI ranking
SGTI 2020 covered 577 Singapore-listed companies in the General Category and 45 REITs and business trusts
which released their annual reports by 30 June 2020.
