Board Statement 

 

Dear valued stakeholders, 

On behalf of the Board of Directors (“Board”), we are pleased to present the first 

Sustainability Report of Vividthree Holdings Ltd (the “Company”, and together with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group” or “Vividthree”) which outlines how sustainability is 

embedded in our business practices and value chain. We believe that as the regional 

forerunner of content creation, we see opportunities in creating an extraordinary 

experience to our community and stakeholders. 

At Vividthree, we strive to look beyond the ordinary and create the next generation of 

entertainment. In creating this vision, we incorporate sustainability goals surrounding 

environment, social and governance (“ESG”) as part of our strategic direction. 

To achieve our vision and sustainability goals, we have embarked on a series of 

collaborations and initiatives such as gaining access to the exclusive intellectual 

properties (“IP”) right to develop and produce a virtual reality (“VR”) tour show for a 

highly popular Korean movie, which was launched in Beijing, China in December 2018, 

and this will continue to expand to Xiamen and other parts of the world. Going forward, 

the Group will continue to explore for more IP and projects, with a focus on widening 

our geographical footprints. 

In our quest to deliver an adventure of multitudinous experiences in virtual reality and 

computer imagery, we value the interests and expectation of our stakeholders through 

continuous engagement and collaborations to create an immersive experience to our 

community.  

We look forward to sharing our achievements with you as we progress in our 

sustainability journey.

Stakeholder Engagement 

Building strong and lasting relationship with stakeholders is critical to the long-term 

sustainability of the Group. It is vital that the stakeholders’ concerns on ESG aspects 

are communicated on an on-going basis and considered in our strategic planning and 

decision-making process.  

Vividthree has identified our key stakeholders by assessing the level of impact of each 

stakeholder on the Group’s value chain. The assessment was conducted through 

consultations between the management team and employees.

Materiality Assessment 

In accordance with the SGX-ST guidelines on sustainability reporting, Vividthree has 

gathered insightful feedbacks from our stakeholders to identify various sustainability 

topics as the key focus of this sustainability report. This exercise has resulted in four 

material topics being identified which reflect key areas of stakeholders’ expectation 

and the significance to the Group’s business. 

 

 

Key topics will be reviewed annually after taking into consideration business goals and 

feedback gathered from our stakeholders. The material topics selected are as follows: 

1. 

Economic Performance - Our economic performance and value generated 

during the financial year. 

 

2. 

Energy Management - Environmental management which is related to efficient 

energy consumption as an initiative to protect environment. 

 

3. 

Employment - Fair employment practices to attract, retain and develop suitable 

candidates for all our business segments. 

 

4. 

Corporate Governance - Applies to all business segments in Singapore and 

overseas as policies and practice in place to uphold good corporate governance, 

including conflict of interest and whistle-blowing policies.

Material Topics 

Economic Performance   

 

 

 

We are committed to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value for our stakeholders. In 

FY2019, Vividthree recorded revenue of S$9.28 million and a net profit of S$3.27 million, 

which contributed to an estimated of 35.24% net profit margin. The Group also reported an 

increase of approximately S$0.56 million or 20.66% from S$2.71 million net profit in the 

financial year ended 31 March 2018. Our economic performance is managed as part of our 

business strategy and reported in detail within our financial highlights in the Annual Report 

2019.

The higher proportion of the revenue recorded in FY2019 was mainly attributable to 

the increase in sales from the Content Production segment which is the TTB VR tour 

show in Beijing. Whereas, the lower proportion of the revenue was from the Post-

production segment. 

The Group has subsequently engaged a promoter in Xiamen and granting them a 1-

year exclusive territorial right to host the TTB VR tour in the province. As the sequel 

of TTB will be released in year 2020, we have received warm responses from several 

promoters and are negotiating to take the TTB VR tour show to other parts of the world. 

Vividthree will continue to strengthen its twin pillar of Content Production segment and 

Post-production segment for future development and expansion. Going forward, we 

will continue to advance our economic performance by seeking new business 

opportunities and gaining stronger footprint in the industry. 

 

Goals 

Going forward, we will explore opportunities to maintain sustainable economic growth 

or sustainable business model and improve shareholders’ return through good 

corporate governance and practices. We will continue to look for merger and 

acquisition opportunities as well as new IP products to expand our Post-production 

and Content Production businesses.

Environmental Protection 

Vividthree strives to be an environment-friendly corporate citizen committed to protect 

the planet, to mitigate climate change, to prevent pollution and to use our scarce 

resources responsibly. 

 

Energy Management 

 

We consume energy as we carry out our daily operations, from post-production, 

graphic design and to the development and production of VR products. To minimise 

our carbon footprint, we have in place energy saving initiatives in our corporate head 

office.  

 

FY2018 

FY2019 

Electricity consumption (kWh) 

116,946 

165,079 

 

In FY2019, the total electricity consumption increased 41% from the previous year due 

to the expansion of development and production of VR technology. Nevertheless, we 

continue to work on our energy saving initiatives to minimise consumption. 

 

Switching to LED lighting 

One of such initiatives is the introduction of energy efficient LED lights to replace 

conventional lighting. 

 

 






 

12 

 

Maintaining air-conditioning temperature 

Employees are encouraged to fix the air-conditioning temperature at 25-27°C to 

reduce the electricity consumption. 

 

Goals 

Moving forward, we will continue to monitor our electricity consumption for effective 

energy management. However, we expect there will be an increase in consumption in 

the next financial year as a result of our foray into more opportunities for use of VR 

technology to improve game and movie experiences.   

 

 


 

13 

 

Employment   

 

Our performance is a collaborative effort and every individual in Vividthree is key to us 

in achieving sustainable growth. We are committed to develop and enhance the well-

being of our employees to retain employees with the right experiences and expertise.  

We recognise the need for talent attraction and retention within our industry which 

requires dynamic and innovative individuals who will propel us to excellence.   

 

Talent Recruitment and retention  

The success of our Group is highly dependent on the expertise and management of 

our employees as well as the creative skillsets requisite to content production and 

virtual reality technology.   

We consistently engage our employees in training programs to be kept abreast with 

technology advancements. 

We have in place good workplace practices which include fair employment practices, 

open communication and encourage feedback to improve working experience 

amongst our employees.  

 

Equal opportunity 

Vividthree encourages fair employment practices and principles to support diversity, 

equality and non-discrimination in our workforce. Talents are recruited regardless of 

gender, race, marital status or age as we believe all of our employees should be 

treated fairly and be respected. 

Additionally, we also ensure compliance with employment laws and regulations 

relating to non-discrimination for dismissals.  

In line with above-mentioned sustainability principle, we strive to employ gender 

diversity in the workplace. The tables below show the statistics of the employees in 

the Group.

regular employee gatherings during festive seasons and leisure activities such as

Corporate Governance   

 

The combination of an effective Board and a good corporate governance framework 

will form a firm foundation for setting up financial integrity, organisational credibility 

and investor confidence. We are committed to maintain good corporate governance 

and ensure best corporate practices to protect both our stakeholders’ and 

shareholders’ interest as well as maximising long-term growth and success of our 

Group.  

It is important for our employees to maintain high standards of integrity in all business 

dealings. We have formalised corporate policies to ensure we maintain the highest 

standards of integrity, accountability and governance in our daily operations. 

 

Conflict of Interest Policy 

The Group has put in place a conflict of interest policy which should be adhered by all 

employees. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing conflict of interests and 

to resolve or mitigate any potential conflicts of interest. Moving forward, we will 

continue to ensure that annual declaration of conflict of interest is to be performed by 

every employee and ensure that potential conflict of interest is monitored and resolved. 

 

Whistleblowing Policy 

The Group has zero tolerance towards dishonesty and corrupt practices and thus has 

formalised and implemented a whistle-blowing policy. A whistle-blowing channel has 

been set up for employees to report in confidence for incidents such as non-

compliance, misconduct, corruption, fraud, abuse of power, undisclosed conflict of 

interest etc. 

In FY2019, there were no reported cases of whistleblowing and fraud reported against 

our management or employees. Going forward, we will continue to monitor the 

compliance on law and regulations and ensure zero incidents.
