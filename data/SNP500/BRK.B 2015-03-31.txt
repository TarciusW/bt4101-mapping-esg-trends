BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 
and Subsidiaries 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
March 31, 2015 
Note 1. General 
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
(“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes the terms
“us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) which includes information
necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual
Report.  Financial information in this Report reflects any adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for
interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for
unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Variations in the amount and timing of investment gains/losses can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.
Investment gains/losses are recorded when investments are disposed or are other-than-temporarily impaired. In addition, changes in the fair values of liabilities associated with derivative contracts can cause significant variations in periodic net
earnings. 
Note 2. New accounting pronouncements 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2014-09
applies to contracts with customers, excluding, most notably, insurance and leasing contracts. ASU 2014-09 prescribes a framework in accounting for revenues from contracts, including (a) identification of the contract, (b) identification
of the performance obligations under the contract, (c) determination of the transaction price, (d) allocation of the transaction price to the identified performance obligations and (e) recognition of revenues as the identified
performance obligations are satisfied. ASU 2014-09 also prescribes additional disclosures and financial statement presentations. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
application is not permitted. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted retrospectively or under a modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect is recognized at the date of initial application. On April 1, 2015, the FASB tentatively decided to
defer the effective date one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In April 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-05 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software,” which clarifies that software licenses contained in a cloud computing arrangement should be capitalized if the customer has the right to take
possession of the software and the ability to run the software outside of the cloud computing arrangement. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively. In
April 2015, the FASB also issued ASU 2015-03 “Interest—Imputation of Interest,” which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, instead of as an asset. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs under current GAAP is not affected by ASU 2015-03. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within
those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be adopted retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. 
We are evaluating the effect the adoption each of these standards will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Note 3. Significant business acquisitions 
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earning
power, good returns on equity and able and honest management.  In the first quarter of 2015, Berkshire acquired
controlling interests of the Van Tuyl Group. The Van Tuyl Group (now named Berkshire Hathaway Automotive) includes 81 automotive dealerships located in 10 states as well as two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a manufacturer of
automotive fluid maintenance products. In addition to selling new and pre-owned automobiles, the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive group offers repair and other services and products, including extended warranty services and other automotive protection
plans. Consideration paid for the acquisition was $4.1 billion. On December 1, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company acquired AltaLink, L.P. (“AltaLink”) for a cash purchase price of C$3.1 billion (approximately $2.7 billion).
AltaLink is a regulated electric transmission-only business, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Financial results attributable to these acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition
dates.

 Investments in foreign government securities include securities issued by national and
provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of March 31, 2015, approximately 93% of foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating
agencies. Approximately 75% of foreign government holdings were issued or guaranteed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Canada or The Netherlands. Unrealized losses on all fixed maturity investments in a continuous unrealized loss position
for more than twelve consecutive months were $10 million as of March 31, 2015 and $15 million as of December 31, 2014. 
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities with fixed maturities at March 31, 2015 are summarized below by
contractual maturity dates. Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers of certain of the securities retain early call or prepayment rights. Amounts are in millions.

Note 5. Investments in equity securities (Continued)   
As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we concluded that there
were no unrealized losses that were other than temporary. Our conclusions were based on: (a) our ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery; (b) our assessment that the underlying business and financial condition of each of
these issuers was favorable; (c) our opinion that the relative price declines were not significant; and (d) our belief that market prices will increase to and exceed our cost. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014,
unrealized losses on equity securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months were $65 million.

 We acquired $2.1 billion liquidation amount of Wrigley preferred stock in conjunction with the
Mars Incorporated (“Mars”) acquisition of Wrigley. The Wrigley preferred stock is entitled to dividends at 5% per annum and is subject to certain put and call arrangements in 2016 and then annually beginning in 2021. The redemption
amount will be based upon the earnings of Wrigley.  We own 3,000,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock of Dow (“Dow Preferred”) with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share. Each share of the Dow Preferred is convertible into 24.201 shares of Dow common stock (equivalent to a conversion price of $41.32 per share). Beginning
in April 2014, Dow has the option to cause some or all of the Dow Preferred to be converted into Dow common stock at the then applicable conversion rate, if the New York Stock Exchange closing price of its common stock exceeds $53.72 per share for
any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the day before Dow exercises its option. The Dow Preferred is entitled to dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum. 
We own 50,000 shares of 6% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of BAC (“BAC Preferred”) with a liquidation
value of $100,000 per share and warrants to purchase 700,000,000 shares of common stock of BAC (“BAC Warrants”). At the end of 2013, Berkshire agreed to a proposed amendment to the BAC Preferred and BAC’s common stock shareholders
approved the amendment on May 7, 2014. The amendment provides that the BAC Preferred may not be redeemed at the option of BAC before May 7, 2019 and dividends payable are no longer cumulative. The BAC Preferred redemption price continues
to be $105,000 per share (or $5.25 billion in aggregate). The BAC Warrants expire in 2021 and are exercisable for an additional aggregate cost of $5 billion ($7.142857/share). 
On December 12, 2014, we acquired Class A 9% Cumulative Compounding Perpetual Preferred Shares of RBI (“RBI
Preferred”) having a stated value of $3 billion and common stock of RBI for an aggregate cost of $3 billion. RBI, domiciled in Canada, is a newly formed entity that is the ultimate parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons. As of the
acquisition date, our combined investment in RBI possessed approximately 14.4% of the voting interests of RBI. The RBI Preferred is entitled to dividends on a cumulative basis of 9% per annum plus an additional amount that is intended to
produce an after-tax yield to Berkshire as if the dividends were paid by a U.S.-based company.

Note 7. Investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation 
On June 7, 2013, Berkshire and an affiliate of the global investment firm 3G Capital (such affiliate,
“3G”), through a newly formed holding company, H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz Holding”), acquired H.J. Heinz Company (“Heinz”). Berkshire and 3G each made equity investments in Heinz Holding, which, together
with debt financing obtained by Heinz Holding, was used to acquire Heinz for approximately $23.25 billion in the aggregate. 
Heinz is one of the world’s leading marketers and producers of healthy, convenient and affordable foods specializing in
ketchup, sauces, meals, soups, snacks and infant nutrition. Heinz is a global family of leading branded products, including Heinz® Ketchup, sauces, soups, beans, pasta, infant foods, Ore-Ida® potato products, Weight Watchers® Smart Ones® entrées and T.G.I.
Friday’s® snacks.  Berkshire’s investments in Heinz
Holding consist of 425 million shares of common stock, warrants to acquire approximately 46 million additional shares of common stock, and cumulative compounding preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference
of $8 billion. The aggregate cost of these investments was $12.25 billion. 3G also acquired 425 million shares of Heinz Holding common stock for $4.25 billion. In addition, Heinz Holding reserved 39.6 million shares of common stock for
issuance to its management and directors under equity grants, including stock options.  The Preferred Stock possesses no
voting rights except as required by law or for certain matters specified in the Heinz Holding charter. The Preferred Stock is entitled to dividends at 9% per annum whether or not declared, is senior in priority to the common stock and is
callable after June 7, 2016 at the liquidation value plus an applicable premium and any accrued and unpaid dividends. Under the Heinz Holding charter and a shareholders’ agreement entered into as of the acquisition date (the
“shareholders’ agreement”), after June 7, 2021, Berkshire can cause Heinz Holding to attempt to sell shares of common stock through public offerings or other issuances (“redemption offerings”), the proceeds of which
would be required to be used to redeem any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. The warrants are exercisable for one cent per share and expire on June 7, 2018. 
Berkshire and 3G each currently own approximately 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock and possess equal voting
interests in Heinz Holding. Under the shareholders’ agreement, unless and until Heinz Holding engages in a public offering, Berkshire and 3G each must approve all significant transactions and governance matters involving Heinz Holding and Heinz
so long as Berkshire and 3G each continue to hold at least 66% of their initial common stock investments, except for (i) the declaration and payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock, and actions related to a Heinz Holding call of the
Preferred Stock, for which Berkshire does not have a vote or approval right, and (ii) redemption offerings and redemptions resulting therefrom, which may only be triggered by Berkshire. No dividends may be paid on the common stock if there are
any unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock. See Note 19 for additional information concerning Berkshire’s investments in Heinz Holding. 
We are accounting for our investments in Heinz Holding common stock and common stock warrants on the equity method.
Accordingly, we included our proportionate share of net earnings attributable to common stockholders and other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. We account for our investment in Preferred Stock
as an equity investment and it is carried at cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dividends earned on the Preferred Stock and our share of Heinz Holding’s net earnings or loss attributable to common stockholders are included in interest,
dividend and other investment income of Insurance and Other in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Summarized consolidated financial
information of Heinz Holding and its subsidiaries follows (in millions).

 Gains from disposals of equity securities in the first quarter of 2014 included non-cash gains
of $949 million from the exchange of Phillips 66 (“PSX”) common stock in connection with the acquisition of Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (subsequently renamed Lubrizol Specialty Products Inc. (“LSPI”)). The non-cash gain
represented the excess of the fair value of the net assets of LSPI received over the cost basis of the PSX shares exchanged. 
We record investments in equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value and record the
difference between fair value and cost in other comprehensive income. OTTI losses recognized in earnings represent reductions in the cost basis of the investment, but not the fair value. Accordingly, such losses that are included in earnings are
generally offset by a credit to other comprehensive income, producing no net effect on shareholders’ equity as of the balance sheet date.

Note 9. Receivables (Continued) 
 
Loans and finance receivables are predominantly installment loans originated
or acquired by our manufactured housing business. Provisions for loan losses for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 were $35 million and $46 million, respectively. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $46 million in the first quarter
of 2015 and $47 million in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, we reclassified $94 million of allowances in uncollectible loans and related installment loan receivables that are in substance foreclosures or repossessions to
other assets. The reclassifications had no impact on earnings or cash flows. At March 31, 2015, approximately 98% of the loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment. As a part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators
are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At March 31, 2015, approximately 99% of the loan balances were determined to be performing and approximately 96% of the loan balances were current as to payment status.

 Represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable under the contracts assuming all underlying issuers default and the residual value of the

businesses are recorded at fair value and the changes in the fair values of such contracts are reported in earnings as derivative gains/losses. We entered into these contracts with the expectation that the premiums received would exceed the amounts
ultimately paid to counterparties. A summary of the derivative gains/losses included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 follows (in millions).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 13. Derivative contracts (Continued) 
 
The equity index put option contracts were written between 2004 and 2008.
These contracts are European style options written on four major equity indexes and will expire between June 2018 and January 2026. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the underlying index value is below the strike
price at the contract expiration date. We received the premiums on these contracts in full at the contract inception dates and therefore have no counterparty credit risk. 
The aggregate intrinsic value (which is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index
values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $444 million at March 31, 2015 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. However, these contracts may not be
unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates. Therefore, the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined for several years. The remaining weighted average life of all contracts was
approximately 5.75 years at March 31, 2015.  Our remaining credit default contract was written in 2008 and relates to
approximately 500 zero-coupon municipal debt issues with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2054. The underlying debt issues have a weighted average maturity of approximately 16.5 years. Pursuant to the contract terms, future loss payments are required
in the event of non-payment by the issuer and non-performance by the primary financial guarantee insurers under their contracts. Payments under our contract, if any, are not required prior to the maturity dates of the underlying obligations. The
premium was received at the inception of this contract and therefore we have no counterparty credit risk.  A limited
number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit ratings. As of March 31, 2015
and December 31, 2014, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA from Standard & Poor’s and Aa2 from Moody’s) are downgraded below either A- by Standard &
Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s, collateral of up to $1.1 billion could be required to be posted.  Our regulated utility
subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures,
swaps and options, are used to manage a portion of these price risks. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets of railroad, utilities and energy businesses and were $107 million and $108 million as of March 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, respectively. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities of railroad, utilities and energy businesses and were $237 million and $230 million as of March 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses under the contracts of our regulated utilities that are probable of recovery or refund through rates are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Unrealized gains or losses on
contracts accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income or in net earnings, as appropriate.

 BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements.
Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure the debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants including, but not limited to, leverage
ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In March 2015, BNSF issued $1.5 billion of debentures consisting of $500 million of 3.0% debentures due in 2025 and
$1.0 billion of 4.15% debentures due in 2045. As of March 31, 2015, BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or
their subsidiaries.

 In January 2015, BHFC issued $1.0 billion of new senior notes consisting of $400 million
floating rate senior notes that mature in 2017 and $600 million floating rate senior notes that mature in 2018, which replaced $1.0 billion of senior notes that matured. The borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire.  As of March 31, 2015, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit
and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $8.4 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included about $4.7 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. In addition
to BHFC’s borrowings, Berkshire has guaranteed other subsidiary borrowings, aggregating approximately $3.4 billion at March 31, 2015. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations.

Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued) 
 
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were
measured using market or income approaches. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the fair values presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of alternative market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1
through 3, which are described below.  Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical
assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.  Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable
inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered
in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated
durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.  Level 3 –
Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and
we may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities. 
Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ending March 31, 2015 and 2014 follow (in millions).

 Other investments consist of preferred stocks and common stock warrants that we acquired in a
few relatively large private placement transactions. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and/or provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted estimated cash flow
techniques in valuing the perpetual preferred stocks, we made assumptions regarding the expected durations of the investments, as the issuers may have the right to redeem or convert these investments. We also made estimates regarding the impact of
subordination, as the preferred stocks have a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments of the issuers. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we are
subject to the aforementioned contractual restrictions and we have applied discounts with respect to such restrictions. Increases or decreases to these inputs would result in decreases or increases to the fair values of the investments. 
Our equity index put option and credit default contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in
derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and many contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3. The methods we use to
value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. 
We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include
current index price, contract duration, dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using any model is inherently subjective
and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Expected volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and assume that the contracts
will remain outstanding until the expiration dates without offsetting transactions occurring in the interim. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities.

 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock
possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting
rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder,
into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,642,982 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2015 and 1,642,909
shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued and outstanding. 
Berkshire’s Board of Directors (“Berkshire’s Board”) has approved a common stock repurchase program under
which Berkshire may repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
Berkshire’s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The
repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share repurchases under the program in the first quarter of
2015.

Note 19. Contingencies and Commitments 
We are parties in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular,
such legal actions affect our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs
occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved
in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  On November 13, 2014, Berkshire entered into a definitive
agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”) whereby it will acquire the Duracell battery business from P&G. Pursuant to the agreement, in exchange for a recapitalized Duracell Company, which will include
approximately $1.7 billion in cash at closing, P&G will receive shares of its common stock currently held by Berkshire subsidiaries having a fair value at March 31, 2015 of approximately $4.3 billion. The transaction is expected to close in
the second half of 2015 and is subject to obtaining various regulatory approvals as well as certain other customary closing conditions. 
On March 24, 2015, Berkshire entered into an Equity Commitment agreement with Heinz Holding, in which Berkshire committed
to acquire approximately 262.9 million of newly issued shares of Heinz Holding for $5.26 billion. Berkshire’s acquisition of such shares is contingent upon the closing of a merger between Heinz Holding and the Kraft Foods Group, Inc.
(“Kraft”) and upon 3G’s acquisition of approximately 237.1 million newly issued shares of Heinz Holding for $4.74 billion concurrent with Berkshire’s additional investment. In connection with the merger between Heinz Holding
and Kraft, shareholders of Kraft will receive one share of newly issued Heinz Holding common stock for each share of Kraft common stock, and a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share. The closing of the merger is subject to Kraft shareholder
approval, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. These transactions are expected to be completed in the second half of 2015. Upon completion, Berkshire will own approximately 26.4% of the outstanding common stock of
Heinz Holding, which would then be renamed The Kraft Heinz Company.  We own a 50% interest in a joint venture, Berkadia
Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), with Leucadia National Corporation (“Leucadia”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special
servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A significant source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through the
issuance of commercial paper. Repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a $2.5 billion surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Leucadia has agreed to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. As of
March 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of Berkadia commercial paper outstanding was $2.47 billion.

 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating
businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate
headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection
of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the
top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 20 to
the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.  Our insurance
businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 of $480 million and $461 million, respectively. In the first quarter of 2015 and 2014, we did not incur any losses from significant catastrophe events.
Our railroad business generated significantly higher earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. Results in 2015 were positively impacted by improved service levels and lower fuel and other operating expenses as compared to 2014. Our utility and energy
business produced lower net earnings in the first quarter of 2015, as earnings from AltaLink (acquired in December 2014) were more than offset by lower earnings from our U.S.-based utility and natural gas pipeline businesses. Earnings from our
manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2015 increased 20% in the aggregate over the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the impact of business acquisitions and earnings growth in certain operations. 
Investment and derivative gains/losses in the first quarter of 2015 included after-tax gains from investments of $63 million
and after-tax gains from changes in the fair values of derivative contracts of $857 million. Investment and derivative gains/losses in the first quarter of 2014 included an after-tax gain of approximately $900 million related to the exchange of
Phillips 66 common stock for 100% of the common stock of a specialty chemical products subsidiary of Phillips 66. In addition, changes in the fair values of derivative contracts produced after-tax gains of $153 million in the first quarter of 2014.
We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant
volatility in our periodic earnings.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Continued)   
Insurance—Underwriting 
We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance
activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers
have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re, (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway
Primary Group.  Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations – underwriting and
investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of
underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains.  The timing and amount of
catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. In the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, we did not incur any significant catastrophe losses, which we
define as losses in excess of $100 million from a single event or series of related events. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts
established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time. Unpaid loss estimates recorded as of the balance sheet date will develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a
corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings.  Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising primarily from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance assets and liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate changes produced pre-tax gains in the first quarter of 2015 and losses in the comparable 2014 period. Historically, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our
underwriting earnings has been relatively significant. These gains and losses are included in underwriting expenses.  A
key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. A measure of capital strength is combined shareholders’ equity determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (“Statutory
Surplus”). Statutory Surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2014. This superior capital strength creates opportunities, especially with respect to reinsurance activities, to negotiate and
enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers. Underwriting results from our insurance businesses are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

GEICO 
Through GEICO, we primarily write private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and
the District of Columbia. GEICO’s policies are marketed mainly by direct response methods in which customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. This is a significant element in our strategy to be
a low-cost auto insurer. In addition, we strive to provide excellent service to customers, with the goal of establishing long-term customer relationships. GEICO’s underwriting results are summarized below. Dollars are in millions.

 Premiums written in the first quarter of 2015 were $5,886 million, an increase of 10.2% as
compared to 2014. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2015 increased $501 million (10.3%) to $5,385 million. The increase in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 9.7%, reflecting policies-in-force growth of 6.5% and increased premiums per
policy of approximately 3.0% during the past twelve months. Voluntary auto new business sales increased about 1.4% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, voluntary auto policies-in-force
increased by 361,000 policies. In recent years, the growth in voluntary auto policies-in-force has been the greatest during the first quarter. 
In the first quarter of 2015, our pre-tax underwriting gain was $160 million, a decline of $193 million compared to the first
quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, we experienced increases in claims frequencies and severities in several of our major coverages and our ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned (the “loss
ratio”) increased to 80.1%, compared to 75.8% in 2014. As a result, we are implementing premium rate increases as needed. 
Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2015 were $4,316 million, an increase of $615 million
(16.6%) over the first quarter of 2014. Claims frequencies were higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 for property damage and collision coverages (three to four percent range), bodily injury coverage (four to five percent range)
and personal injury protection (PIP) coverage (one to two percent range). Average claims severities were also higher in the first quarter of 2015 for physical damage and collision coverages (four to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (four
to six percent range) and PIP coverage (two to four percent range). Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2015 were $909 million, an increase of $79 million (9.5%) over 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to
generate the increase in policies-in-force and to maintain service for existing policyholders.

General Re 
Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients
worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and
casualty reinsurance is also written in broker markets through Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to
generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. General Re’s
underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions.

 Property/casualty 
Property/casualty premiums written in the first quarter of 2015 declined $222 million (16%), while premiums earned decreased
$58 million (7%) compared to the first quarter of 2014. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written in 2015 declined 4%, while premiums earned increased 2% compared to 2014. Insurance industry capacity to write
business remains high and price competition for most property/casualty markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. However, we remain prepared to write more business when appropriate prices can be
attained relative to the risks assumed.  In the first quarter, our property/casualty business produced aggregate pre-tax
underwriting losses of $14 million in 2015 compared to pre-tax underwriting gains of $101 million in 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $5 million compared to pre-tax underwriting gains
of $122 million in the first quarter of 2014. The comparative decline in first quarter underwriting results from property business was driven by an increase in current accident year reported losses. In 2015 and 2014, property results benefitted from
reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ exposures. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in periodic underwriting results. 
Our casualty/workers’ compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $9 million in the first quarter of
2015 and $21 million in the first quarter of 2014. The pre-tax underwriting losses in each period reflected recurring discount accretion on workers’ compensation liabilities and amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance
contracts, which aggregated $29 million in 2015 and $41 million in 2014. Underwriting results in each period also included gains from reductions of estimated ultimate losses on prior years’ business of $66 million in 2015 and $54 million in
2014. Casualty losses tend to be long-tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period means that the ultimate liability estimates currently established will continue to develop favorably.

Life/health 
Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2015 were $768 million, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2014. However,
adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in the first quarter of 2015 increased $62 million (8%) compared to the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, we generated increased life business across a
number of non-U.S. markets, particularly in Canada and Asia as compared to 2014. Our life/health operations produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $33 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $21 million in the first quarter of 2014. In 2015, we
increased liabilities for life benefits as a result of the reduction of discount rates in Europe and Australia. In addition, we experienced foreign exchange losses on our international business and greater than expected loss activity from our North
America operations. In 2014, our international life/health business incurred increased losses on disability business in Europe and an increase in large claims in the Australian life business. The first quarter underwriting losses in both years also
reflected periodic discount accretion primarily on U.S. long-term care liabilities.  Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance
Group  Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and
casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce extraordinary volatility in the periodic underwriting results. BHRG also
writes retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events arising under property/casualty coverages. BHRG’s underwriting activities also include life reinsurance and
annuity businesses. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in millions.

 Property/casualty 
Premiums written in the first quarter of 2015 were $1,374 million, a decline of 2% compared to 2014. In the first quarter
of 2015, approximately one-half of property/casualty premiums written were attributable to three contracts. Our volume for most property/casualty coverages, and for property catastrophe coverages in particular, continues to be constrained. Rates, in
our view, are generally inadequate. However, we have the capacity and desire to write substantially more business when appropriate pricing can be obtained. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2015 declined 24% versus 2014, attributable primarily
due to lower premiums earned from property quota-share coverages and from the run-off of the Swiss Re quota-share contract. 
The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $531 million in 2015 compared to $291 million in 2014.
There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2015 or 2014. Underwriting results included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $167 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to losses of $37 million in 2014. These foreign
currency transaction gains and losses relate to certain reinsurance liabilities of U.S.-based subsidiaries (primarily arising under retroactive reinsurance contracts), which are denominated in foreign currencies. In the first quarter of 2015, the
U.S. Dollar strengthened over several major currencies, which reduced liabilities in U.S. Dollars and resulted in foreign currency exchange gains.

Retroactive reinsurance 
Retroactive reinsurance contracts provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss
events, and related claims are generally expected to be paid over long periods of time. Premiums and limits of indemnification are often very large in amount. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded for the excess, if
any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss
payments. The original estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments are periodically analyzed against actual experience and revised based on an actuarial evaluation of the expected remaining losses. Amortization charges and deferred charge
adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in periodic earnings. 
Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive contracts for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 were $126 million and $53
million, respectively. There were no significant increases to estimated ultimate losses related to prior years’ contracts during the first quarters of 2015 or 2014. The increase in underwriting losses in 2015 was primarily related to deferred
charge amortization on contracts written in the last half of 2014 and from the impact of gains in the first quarter of 2014 from the commutations of two contracts. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $23.7
billion at March 31, 2015 and $24.3 billion at December 31, 2014. Unamortized deferred charges related to BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $7.5 billion at March 31, 2015 and $7.7 billion at
December 31, 2014. As previously indicated, the amortization of deferred charge balances will be charged to pre-tax earnings in the future. 
Life and annuity 
Life and annuity premiums earned in the first quarter of 2015 declined $62 million (10%) compared to 2014. The decline was
primarily attributable to lower premiums earned from traditional life reinsurance contracts and structured settlement annuities. The life and annuity business produced pre-tax gains of $54 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to pre-tax
losses of $55 million in 2014, which included foreign currency transaction gains of $85 million and losses of $11 million, respectively, with respect to foreign currency denominated annuity liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. 
Before foreign currency transaction gains and losses, structured settlement and traditional annuity reinsurance contracts
generated underwriting losses of $74 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $63 million in 2014. Generally, all of the premiums under these contracts are received at inception and payments are made over time, often extending for decades. The
periodic underwriting losses in 2015 and 2014 were primarily attributable to the recurring impact of the accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Aggregate annuity liabilities were approximately $7.3 billion at March 31, 2015 and $7.1
billion at December 31, 2014. The life and annuity business also included pre-tax gains of $53 million in the first quarter of 2015 and pre-tax losses of $28 million in 2014 from variable annuity guarantee contracts. The gains in 2015 were
primarily attributable to the impact of rising equity markets which resulted in lowering our estimates of liabilities for guaranteed minimum benefits. Periodic results from these contracts can be volatile reflecting changes in returns in investment
markets, which impact the underlying insured exposures.  Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group
 The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) consists of a wide variety of independently managed
insurance businesses. These businesses include: Medical Protective Company and Princeton Insurance Company, providers of healthcare malpractice insurance coverages; National Indemnity Company’s primary group (“NICO Primary”), writers
of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to as Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”),
providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers’ compensation; Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), which concentrates on providing large scale insurance solutions for commercial property and
casualty risks; Applied Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”), providers of workers’ compensation and commercial property and casualty
insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses; and Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and Medicare Supplement insurance. 
Premiums earned in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 aggregated $1,210 million and $953 million, respectively. The increase
in premiums was primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and GUARD. The BH Primary insurers produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting gains of $175 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $99 million in 2014.
Combined loss ratios were 58% in the first quarter of 2015 and 62% in 2014. Overall, the claim environment in recent years has been favorable. However, these primary insurers write primarily liability and workers’ compensation business, and
related claims settlements may occur over lengthy time periods. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience, loss ratios or underwriting results will continue into the future.

 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of our
insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in the first quarter of 2015 was $1,087 million, an increase of $141 million (15%) over 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase in dividend income from equity securities, partially
offset by lower interest earned from fixed maturity securities. In 2015, investment income included dividends from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. 9% Preferred Stock ($3 billion stated value), which was acquired in December
2014. Our insurance businesses continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances (approximately $42.4 billion as of March 31, 2015) earning very low yields. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on
safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents. Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid
losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition
costs. Float approximated $83.5 billion at March 31, 2015 and $84.0 billion at December 31, 2014.  A summary of
cash and investments held in our insurance businesses follows. Other investments include our investments in The Dow Chemical Company, Bank of America Corporation and Restaurant Brands International, Inc. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated

 Consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2015 were approximately $5.6 billion,
representing an increase of $155 million (3%) over 2014. The overall increase in revenues reflected a 1% increase in cars/units handled and a 1% increase in average revenue per car/unit, which reflected changes in business mix, partially offset
by a decline in fuel surcharges of $220 million (31%) primarily due to lower fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.7 billion, an increase of $503 million (43%) over 2014. Results in the first quarter of 2015
benefitted from improved operating performance, volume increases in certain product lines and the favorable impact of lower fuel prices. Changes in fuel surcharges reflected in revenues generally lag the changes in fuel costs, and the relative
impact on first quarter earnings was greater than is expected over the remainder of 2015.  Our operating performance in
2014 was substandard as we experienced significant service related challenges over most of the year. We attribute operational improvements in 2015 to capacity added in 2014 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects,
additional equipment, new employee hires and other operational initiatives, as well as from more favorable winter weather conditions. The impact of these improvements was partially offset by lower intermodal container and trailer volume, primarily
attributable to congestion on the U.S. West Coast resulting from port labor disputes. We plan to continue our capital expansion and operational improvement initiatives in 2015 in order to meet customer demand and improve and maintain service levels.
 In the first quarter of 2015, revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion, a 2% increase over 2014. The increase
reflected a 3% increase in volume, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. Revenues from agricultural products increased 19% to approximately $1.2 billion, attributable to a 15% increase in volume, as well as from rate and product
mix changes. Coal revenues during the first quarter of 2015 increased 4% to $1.3 billion, reflecting a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by lower average rates. Revenues from consumer products during the first quarter of 2015 were $1.5
billion, a decline of 10% from 2014. The decline reflected a significant decrease in international intermodal volume due to the aforementioned congestion at U.S. West Coast ports and from lower average revenues per car for both international and
domestic intermodal business. As a result of tentative labor agreements reached at those ports, our intermodal volumes increased in the latter part of the first quarter. 
Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2015 were $3.7 billion, a decrease of $369 million (9%) compared to the first
quarter of 2014. In 2015, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined 8.6 percentage points to 66.3%. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $120 million (10%), primarily due to increased employment levels and wage rates. Fuel
expenses declined $446 million (38%) in 2015 due to significantly lower average fuel prices and improved efficiency, partially offset by higher volumes. In 2015, depreciation and amortization expense declined $19 million (4%) as a result
of lower capitalized software amortization expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation expense on increased levels of railroad assets in service. 
Interest expense in the first quarter of 2015 was $217 million, an increase of $21 million (11%) compared to 2014. BNSF
funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. The increased interest expense in 2015 resulted from higher average outstanding debt.

Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”)
 We hold an 89.9% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates an
international energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are currently comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”), and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity
distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. BHE acquired AltaLink, L.P. (“AltaLink”) on December 1, 2014. AltaLink operates a regulated
electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada. AltaLink’s revenues and earnings in 2015 are included in other energy businesses. In addition, BHE also operates a diversified portfolio of independent power projects and the
second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest franchise networks in the United States.  The
rates that our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not
allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

 PacifiCorp 
PacifiCorp operates an electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming.
PacifiCorp’s revenues in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.26 billion, a decrease of $44 million (3%) from the first quarter of 2014, reflecting a $20 million decline in retail revenues and a $24 million decline in wholesale and other
revenues. The decline in retail revenues was attributable to lower customer loads mostly due to the impacts of mild weather in 2015, partially offset by higher rates. Wholesale revenues and other revenues declined primarily due to lower volume.
PacifiCorp’s EBIT in the first quarter of 2015 were $197 million, a decline of $26 million (12%) from the first quarter of 2014. The decline resulted from the impact of lower revenues and increased depreciation and amortization expense
($11 million) due to increased plant-in-service, partially offset by lower energy costs.  MEC
 MEC operates an electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. MEC’s revenues in the first
quarter of 2015 declined $270 million (22%) to $974 million, reflecting lower regulated natural gas revenues ($216 million), regulated electric revenues ($24 million) and nonregulated markets and other revenues ($30 million). The comparative
decline in first quarter natural gas revenues was primarily due to a lower average per-unit cost of gas sold ($194 million) which is offset in cost of sales, and a 14% decline in retail sales volumes attributable to comparatively warmer weather in
2015. The decline in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to lower average rates reflecting a rate structure approved in August 2014, resulting in a greater differential between higher rates from June to September and lower rates in the
remaining months, partially offset by increases in base rates. The decline in nonregulated and other revenues was primarily due to lower natural gas prices and volumes, partially offset by higher electricity volumes. MEC’s EBIT in the first
quarter of 2015 decreased $45 million (36%) to $81 million as compared to 2014. The decline resulted from the impact of lower revenues and increased depreciation and amortization expense ($15 million) from additional plant-in-service.

Company”) (Continued)   
NV Energy 
NV Energy operates electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. NV Energy’s revenues in the first quarter of 2015 were
$716 million, an increase of $73 million (11%) over 2014, due primarily to higher regulated retail electric revenues. The increase in regulated electric revenues reflected increased customer loads and average regulated rates. EBIT in the first
quarter of 2015 was $69 million, an increase of $26 million (60%) over 2014. The increase in EBIT was attributable to the increase in electric revenues, partially offset by increased energy costs ($40 million). 
Northern Powergrid 
Northern Powergrid’s revenues in the first quarter of 2015 increased $6 million (2%) to $324 million, while EBIT
increased $16 million (11%) to $160 million. These increases were due mainly to higher distribution revenues attributable to tariff rates, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. 
Natural Gas Pipelines 
Natural gas pipeline revenues in the first quarter of 2015 declined $55 million (14%) to $334 million, while EBIT declined
$29 million (14%) to $185 million. These declines reflected lower revenues from lower natural gas sales volumes as a result of comparatively warmer weather in 2015 within the Northern Natural Gas Company service territory. 
Other energy businesses 
Revenues and EBIT in the first quarter of 2015 from other energy businesses were $270 million and $32 million, respectively,
compared to revenues of $47 million and a pre-tax loss of $11 million in 2014. The increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion of revenues and EBIT of AltaLink. AltaLink’s revenues and EBIT in the first quarter of 2015 were $138
million and $36 million, respectively.  Real estate brokerage 
Real estate brokerage revenues in the first quarter of 2015 increased 26% to $450 million compared to the first quarter of
2014, reflecting an increase in closed transactions, an increase in average home prices and the impact of business acquisitions in 2014. Real estate brokerage activities generated break-even results in the first quarter of 2015 and pre-tax losses of
$13 million in 2014.  Corporate interest and income taxes 
Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance
subsidiaries. In 2015, corporate interest expense increased due to borrowings in connection with the AltaLink acquisition. BHE’s consolidated income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax earnings for the first quarter was 21.5% in 2015 and
18.5% in 2014. In each period, BHE’s utility subsidiaries effective income tax rates reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid and
AltaLink are taxed at lower statutory rates in the U.K. and Canada, respectively, compared to the statutory tax rate in the U.S.

McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products to retailers, convenience stores
and restaurants. Through its subsidiaries, McLane also operates as a wholesale distributor of distilled spirits, wine and beer. McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses are marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins and have
several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have a significant adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. 
Revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $11.6 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion (11%) over the first quarter of
2014. The increase reflected higher revenues in grocery and foodservice operations, in part due to a greater number of business days in the first quarter of 2015 than in 2014. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $131 million, an
increase of $16 million (14%) over 2014. The ratio of pre-tax earnings to revenues in the first quarter of 2015 was approximately 1.1%, and was relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2014. In 2015, overall gross sales margins declined
by 0.17 percentage points, which was substantially offset by the impact of lower fuel and trucking expenses in 2015. 
Manufacturing 
This group includes a variety of businesses that manufacture industrial and end-user products and include: The Lubrizol
Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer; IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide; Forest River, a leading manufacturer
of leisure vehicles; CTB, a manufacturer of equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries; and the diversified manufacturing operations of Marmon. Our manufacturing businesses also include several building products businesses
(Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and six apparel businesses (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes Russell athletic apparel and Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel). A summary of revenues and
earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions).

First quarter 2015 revenues of our industrial and end-user products
businesses increased $162 million (3%) to $5.5 billion as compared to 2014. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $860 million, an increase of $42 million (5%) over 2014. Lubrizol’s revenues in the first quarter of 2015 increased
5% to $1.8 billion, reflecting the impact of bolt-on acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of lower volume from legacy Additives and Advanced Materials business and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects due to the strengthening of
the U.S. Dollar. Lubrizol’s earnings in the first quarter of 2015 increased 20% over 2014, primarily due to the favorable impact of lower average raw material costs due to lower oil prices and bolt-on acquisitions, partially offset by
unfavorable foreign currency translation movements. Forest River’s revenues increased 15% to $1.04 billion, while earnings increased 28% over 2014. The increases were driven by increased unit sales. In the first quarter of 2015, IMC’s
revenues and earnings declined 5% and 16%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. 
Marmon’s manufacturing revenues were approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, relatively unchanged from
2014. Revenues in the first quarter of 2015 reflected increased commercial trailer and retail products demand, which were largely offset by the impact of lower copper prices on electrical and plumbing products, lower retail store fixture volumes,
and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. Marmon’s manufacturing pre-tax earnings were $163 million representing an increase of $18 million (12.5%) over the comparable period in
2014. Earnings as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2015 was 11.6% compared to 10.3% in the prior year. The first quarter 2015 earnings increase reflected cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in our beverage
dispensing and merchandising businesses and electrical and plumbing products businesses during the second half of 2014, along with the positive impact of revenue growth in the commercial trailer and retail products businesses, partially offset by
the adverse foreign currency translation effects.  Revenues in the first quarter of 2015 from our building products
businesses were $2.3 billion, an increase of 4% over 2014. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2015 increased $85 million (59%) over 2014. Most of the comparative increase in first quarter earnings was generated by Shaw’s flooring
business and by Johns Manville’s insulation and roofing business. In the first quarter of 2015, these businesses generally benefitted from increased sales volume and lower raw material and energy costs. 
Apparel revenues in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.0 billion, a decline of 3% from 2014. In 2015, apparel earnings
increased $10 million (10%) over 2014. In 2015, earnings of our apparel businesses benefitted from ongoing restructuring initiatives which contributed to generally lower manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs. 
Service and retailing 
Our service and retailing businesses are engaged in various service-related activities, and sell various products through
wholesale distribution or at the retail channels. These businesses include NetJets, a leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft; FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft;
Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system of over 6,500 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News and the BH Media Group
(“BH Media”), which includes the Omaha World-Herald, as well as 29 other daily newspapers and numerous other publications; WPLG (acquired June 30, 2014), which operates a television station in Miami, Florida; and Charter Brokerage, a
leading third party logistics provider to the petroleum and chemical industries (acquired on December 12, 2014).  Our
service and retailing businesses also include: TTI, an electronic components distributor; four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), three jewelry retailing businesses
(Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies, which makes and sells confectionary products though its retail stores and quantity order centers; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools and Oriental Trading Company
(“OTC”), a direct retailer of party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties. In the first quarter of 2015, we acquired The VanTuyl Group (now named Berkshire Hathaway Automotive or “BHA”). BHA includes 81 auto
dealerships located in 10 states, which sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair and other related services and products. BHA also includes two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a manufacturer of automotive fluid
maintenance products.  Service and retailing revenues in the first quarter of 2015 were $4.5 billion, an increase of $1.2
billion (35%) compared to 2014. In 2015, revenue increases reflected the impact of the BHA acquisition and increased revenues from TTI (12%) and our home furnishings retailers (9%), partially offset by a decline in revenues from NetJets
(3.5%), which was primarily due to lower fuel cost recoveries and unfavorable foreign currency effects. The decline in NetJets’ fuel surcharge income was substantially offset by lower fuel expense resulting in a minimal impact on earnings.
TTI’s revenue increase was attributable to higher unit volume and bolt-on acquisitions, and the increase in revenues from home furnishings retailers was driven by Nebraska Furniture Mart, which opened a new store in a suburb of Dallas, Texas in
March 2015.

Pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses in the first quarter
of 2015 were $384 million, an increase of $97 million (34%) versus 2014. The earnings increase in 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the BHA acquisition, two business acquisitions in 2014 (WPLG and Charter Brokerage) and an increase in
earnings from NetJets, partially offset by a decline in earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart. NetJets’ earnings in the first quarter of 2015 reflected increased margin on aircraft sales and lower aircraft impairment charges due, in part, to
stabilizing used aircraft values, as well as lower depreciation expense and increased foreign currency transaction gains. The decline in earnings at Nebraska Furniture Mart was principally due to start-up operating costs associated with its new
store in Texas.  Finance and Financial Products 
Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation
equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, “transportation equipment leasing”), as well as other leasing and financing activities. UTLX manufactures, owns and leases railcars and intermodal tank cars, and
also owns and leases cranes, while XTRA owns and leases over-the-road trailers. A summary of earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts are in millions.

 Clayton Homes pre-tax earnings were $149 million for the first quarter of 2015, an increase of
$34 million (30%) compared to 2014. Earnings continued to benefit from lower loan loss provisions on installment loan portfolios, lower interest expense on borrowings and improved manufacturing results. The decline in loan provisions reflected
fewer delinquencies and foreclosures, while the decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower rates. As of March 31, 2015, approximately 96% of the aggregate installment loans were current in terms of payment status. Traditional single
family housing markets receive significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Despite this competitive
disadvantage, Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably. 
Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2015 from our transportation equipment leasing businesses were $205 million, an
increase of $23 million (13%) over the first quarter of 2014. The earnings increase reflected a 7% increase in aggregate lease revenues, primarily due to increased units on lease and higher lease rates for railcars, partly offset by unfavorable
foreign currency translation effects and lower volumes in our Canadian crane business due to weaker oil drilling market conditions in the region. A significant portion of the costs of these businesses, such as depreciation, do not vary
proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings.  Other
earnings from finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business (“Berkadia”) in which we own a 50% joint venture interest, and interest and dividends from a portfolio
of investments. First quarter earnings from our investment in Berkadia were $30 million in 2015 and $14 million in 2014. In addition, other earnings includes income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings by a Berkshire
financing subsidiary that are used to fund installment loans made by Clayton Homes and debt guarantee fees charged to NetJets. Corresponding expenses are included in Clayton Homes’ and NetJets’ results. Guarantee fees and interest spreads
charged to Clayton Homes and NetJets in the first quarter were $16 million in 2015 and $18 million in 2014.

 Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption, or exchange of investments
or when investments are carried at fair value with the periodic changes in fair values recorded in earnings. The timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses
included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  We believe the amount of investment gains/losses
included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our
management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in earnings.
 Pre-tax investment gains in the first quarter were $97 million in 2015 and $1,150 million in 2014. Investment gains in
the first quarter of 2014 included $949 million realized in connection with the exchange of shares of Phillips 66 common stock for 100% of the common stock of a specialty chemical products subsidiary of Phillips 66. The exchange transaction was
structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the Phillips 66 shares exchanged and the tax-basis cost of those shares. 
Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) charges in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 were not significant.
Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date OTTI charges are recorded in earnings, the increases
are not reflected in earnings but are instead included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and
ultimately sales may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of an OTTI charge does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently
increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost.  As of March 31, 2015, consolidated gross unrealized losses on
our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities determined on an individual purchase lot basis were $1.2 billion. We concluded that as of that date, such losses were not other than temporary. We consider several factors in determining
whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price
recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline.  Derivative gains/losses primarily represent
the changes in fair value of our remaining credit default contract and our equity index put option contracts. Periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts are reflected in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of
underlying credit and equity markets.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Continued)  Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)
  
Derivative contracts produced first quarter pre-tax gains of approximately
$1.3 billion in 2015 and $236 million in 2014. In 2015, the gains were primarily related to equity index put option contracts, while 2014 reflected gains from credit default contract exposures, partially offset by losses under the equity index put
option contracts. In 2015, the gains from equity index put option contracts reflected increased index values and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar, which reduced liabilities of contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The losses in
2014 were primarily due to lower interest rate assumptions. As of March 31, 2015, the intrinsic values of these contracts were $444 million and our recorded liabilities at fair value were $3.25 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any,
under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates, which begin in 2018, and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts as of those dates. 
Other 
Corporate income and expenses not allocated to operating businesses includes our investments in Heinz which generated pre-tax
earnings of $231 million in 2015 and $188 million in 2014. Also included in other earnings are amortization of fair value adjustments made in connection with several prior business acquisitions (primarily related to the amortization of identifiable
intangible assets) and corporate interest expense.  Financial Condition  
Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’
equity at March 31, 2015 was $241.5 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion since December 31, 2014. Our net earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $5.2 billion, which were partially offset by losses in other comprehensive income
primarily related to unrealized investment appreciation and foreign currency translation.  At March 31, 2015, cash
and investments of insurance and other businesses (excluding our investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation) were $58.2 billion and $155.9 billion. We used approximately $4.0 billion in cash in the first quarter of 2015 to fund business
acquisitions. Our various insurance and non-insurance businesses continued to generate significant cash flows from operations. 
In the first quarter of 2015, Berkshire Hathaway parent company issued €3.0 billion in senior unsecured notes
consisting of €750 million of 0.75% senior notes due in 2023, €1.25 billion of 1.125% senior notes due in 2027 and €1.0 billion of 1.625% senior notes due in 2035. During the first quarter of 2015, parent company debt of $1.7
billion matured and was repaid.  Berkshire’s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its
Class A and Class B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely, but does
not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B common shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. Financial
strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets
(property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In the first quarter of 2015, aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses were approximately $2.6 billion, including
$1.4 billion by BHE and $1.2 billion by BNSF. BNSF and BHE forecast aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $9.4 billion for the remainder of 2015. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and
debt issuances.  In March 2015, BNSF issued $1.5 billion of debentures consisting of $500 million of 3.0% debentures due
in 2025 and $1.0 billion of 4.15% debentures due in 2045. BNSF’s outstanding debt was approximately $20.5 billion as of March 31, 2015. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were approximately $36.1 billion as of
March 31, 2015, which excludes borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. BNSF and BHE aggregate debt and capital lease maturities over the remainder of 2015 are approximately $1.0 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of
debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BHE or BNSF or any of their subsidiaries.

(Continued)  Financial Condition (Continued) 
 
Finance and financial products assets were approximately $32.9 billion as of
March 31, 2015, a decrease of $597 million since December 31, 2014. Assets of these businesses consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, cash and cash equivalents, a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments, as well
as a sizable portfolio of various types of equipment and furniture held for lease.  Finance and financial products
liabilities were $17.5 billion as of March 31, 2015, a decrease of $1,353 million since December 31, 2014. Most of the decline was attributable to a decline in fair values of derivative contracts. Notes payable and other borrowings were
$12.7 billion as of March 31, 2015, a decline of $74 million compared to year-end 2014. As of March 31, 2015, notes payable included $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In January
2015, $1.0 billion of BHFC debt matured and at that time BHFC issued $1.0 billion of new floating rate senior notes of which $400 million mature in 2017 and $600 million mature in 2018. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to fund loans
originated and loans acquired by Clayton Homes. An additional $500 million of BHFC senior notes mature in December 2015. 
As described in Note 13 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, our finance and financial products businesses
are party to equity index put option and credit default contracts. With limited exceptions, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or intrinsic value of the
contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. At March 31, 2015, the liabilities recorded for such contracts were approximately $3.5 billion and we had no collateral posting requirements. The full and timely payment of principal
and interest on the BHFC notes and the payment of any amounts due at the expiration of the equity index put option and credit default contracts are guaranteed by Berkshire. 
We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial
products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. 
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”) was signed into law. The
Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act have been
subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies. Although the Reform Act may adversely affect certain of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Contractual Obligations 
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations
pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements. Such obligations will be reflected in future
periods as the goods are delivered or services provided.  During the first quarter of 2015, we issued new term debt
through the Berkshire parent company and various subsidiaries. Future payments of principal and interest related to such borrowings are summarized as follows (in millions): 2015-$40; 2016 and 2017-$632; 2018 and 2019-$822; and after 2019-$7,042.
Reference is also made to Note 19 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Except as otherwise noted herein, our contractual obligations as of March, 2015 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the
“Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
 Critical Accounting Policies 
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based
on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Continued)  Critical Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2015 includes estimated
liabilities for unpaid losses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $70.6 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve amounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely
differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance
losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of
acquired businesses of $62.9 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2014. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2015 is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired as a result of changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A goodwill impairment charge could have a material
effect on periodic earnings.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant derivative contract liabilities with
respect to our long-duration equity index put option contracts. The fair values recorded for these liabilities are based on valuation models that utilize various inputs and assumptions that we believe are used by market participants. We further
believe that fair values based on such models are inherently subjective and the values in an actual transaction may differ significantly from the model values. Changes in the assumptions utilized within the valuation models may have a significant
effect on recorded fair values and periodic earnings.  Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in
Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  Forward-Looking Statements 
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press
releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
“Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or
prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have
no specific intention to update these statements.  Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or
forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or act of
terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic
and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk
Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2015, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the
Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Corporation’s periodic SEC
filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting.

Part II Other Information 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
We are party in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular, such legal actions
affect our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek
punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 to which
reference is made herein.  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and
Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities  In September 2011, Berkshire’s Board of Directors (“Berkshire’s
Board”) approved a common stock repurchase program under which Berkshire may repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. In December 2012, Berkshire’s Board
amended the repurchase program by raising the price limit to no higher than a 20% premium over book value. Berkshire may repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Berkshire’s Board authorization does not
specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely
and the amount of repurchases will depend entirely upon the level of cash available, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon, and the degree of discount of the market price relative to
management’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share
repurchases under the program in the first three months of 2015.  Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior
Securities  None 
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with
Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-Q.  Item 5.
