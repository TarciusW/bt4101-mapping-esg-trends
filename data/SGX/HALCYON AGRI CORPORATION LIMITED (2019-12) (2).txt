Remuneration of each of the Executive Directors comprising basic salary as well as a variable bonus (if any) that is

 BOARD MATTERS

The Board’s Conduct of Affairs

The Company is committed to conduct its business with integrity, fairness and transparency and will not tolerate any 

acts, attempted acts, or assistance with any form of bribery or corruption whether direct or indirect. The Company’s 

Board is effective, comprises professionals with a broad range of experience and industry expertise, who discharge 

their duties and responsibilities at all times as fiduciaries in the interests of the Company. The Board embraces value 

creation, innovation, sustainability and ethical business practices, and has embedded them in setting the strategic 

directions of the Company. 

Duties of the Board. The principal functions of the Board are to: 

(a) 

establish corporate values and ethical standards of conduct for the Group; 

(b) 

oversee the business performance and affairs of the Group and provide entrepreneurial leadership; 

(c) 

set strategic direction for the Group, maintain the policy and decision making framework in which the strategy is 

implemented;

(d) 

establish and maintain a sound risk management framework and adequate internal controls, setting risk appetite 

to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and the Group’s performance;

(e) 

supervise, monitor and review the function and performance of the Group’s management and ensure that 

necessary resources are in place for the Company to meet its strategic objectives;

(f) 

review and approve annual budgets, financial plans, major acquisitions and divestment plans, funding and 

investment proposals; 

(g) 

ensure transparency and accountability to key stakeholder groups including compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations as well as the financial reporting standards; 

(h) 

review and approve the appointment of Directors and KMP; and

(i) 

instil an ethical corporate culture and promote sustainable development.

Delegation of Authority. The Board capitalises on the expertise of the Independent Directors and benefits from 

delegating certain functions and authority of the Board to the four (4) board committees, namely, the AC, NC, RC 

and StratCom (collectively the “Board Committees”). Each Board Committee functions within clearly defined terms 

of reference (“TOR”) setting out their compositions, authorities and duties. The TOR of the NC, RC and AC have been 

updated in accordance with the amendments to the Code which took effect on 1 January 2019, approved by the Board 

and adopted by the respective Board Committees.

While the Board Committees are tasked with certain responsibilities, all major decision-making remains the ultimate 

responsibility of the Board as a whole. Except for the chairman of StratCom who is not an independent director, all other 

Board Committees are led by an Independent Director, to encourage independent oversight and enable the Board to 

discharge its obligations more effectively. Detailed functions and involvement of the Board Committees are described 

on pages 105 to 114 of this annual report. 

The Board embraces the principle of empowerment, and believes that governance and management are more 

effective and efficient when they are separated. It upholds high standards of corporate governance, puts in place a 

code of conduct and ethics, sets appropriate tone-from-the-top and desired organisational culture, and ensures 

proper accountability within the Company. The day-to-day management, operation and administration of the Group 

are led by the executive Directors and the senior management of the Group (collectively, the “Management”), whose 

are accountable to the Board for their performance in pursuing the long-term success of the Group. The Management 

collaborates closely with the Non-executive Directors and provide insights on the Group’s operations.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

HALCYON AGRI - 2019 CORPORATE REPORT

[aggregate] [innovate] [sustain]

The Board has in place, a written Policy on Board Delegation of Authority (the “Delegation Policy”) which set out the 

framework and mechanisms by which the Board delegates specific standing powers and limits of authority to specified 

positions, to provide clear directions to Management on matters that must be approved by the Board. The Delegation 

Policy is aimed at balancing the need for empowering and devolving decision-making to appropriate levels for 

operational efficiency and ensuring that proper systems of control are in place. Material transactions, including but not 

limited to the matters set out below, are reserved for the Board’s decision and approval:

(a) 

overall Group business and budget strategies;

(b) 

capital expenditures, investments or divestments exceeding certain material thresholds;

(c) 

all capital-related matters including capital issuance and redemption;

(d) 

significant policies governing the operations of the Company;

(e) 

corporate strategic development and restructuring;

(f) 

material interested person transactions which fall within the meaning of the Listing Manual; and

(g) 

risk management strategies.

All material transactions are reserved for the Board’s decision as a whole, without any individual or group of individuals 

exercising any considerable concentration of power or influence, or being allowed to dominate the Board’s decision 

making.

Directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the Company and are required to take all reasonable steps to avoid 

conflicts of interest with the Company. The Policy on Director’s Conflicts of Interest complements the Company’s 

corporate governance practice, and serves to guide the Directors in recognising and handling conflict situations. This 

policy requires any member of the Board or Board Committees who has an interest in a matter being deliberated upon 

by the Directors to recuse himself from discussions and abstain from participating in the approval process involving the 

issue of conflict. 

Board Meetings. Four (4) meetings were scheduled and held at regular intervals in FY2019 to review, among others, 

the Group’s financial performance, annual budget, corporate strategy, business plans, potential corporate actions, risk 

management policies, appointment and re-appointment of Directors and KMP, executive remuneration and significant 

operational matters. Besides the scheduled Board meetings, the Board meets on an ad-hoc basis, when required, to 

discuss and receive updates from Management on the development of corporate actions that took place during the 

year. 

The Board believes that meetings between Directors who do not hold executive positions in the Group encourage 

and promote greater openness and facilitate provision of well-balanced viewpoints to the Board. Non-executive 

Directors may summon a meeting without the presence of the Management whenever deemed appropriate. Any 

recommendations or suggestions arising from their discussions will be communicated to the Board or the Management 

as appropriate. 

The Chairman oversees the setting of Board meeting agendas, and the Directors are encouraged to propose any topic 

that is deemed appropriate to be discussed. Draft meeting agendas are circulated to the chairmen of the Board and 

Board Committees in advance for comments, to make sure that all material topics are attended to. 

To ensure meetings are held with maximum Director participation, all Board meetings are planned and scheduled in 

advance after consultation with Directors. In addition, Directors who are not able to be physically present in the Board 

meetings may participate in the Board and Board Committee meetings by telephonic conference, as permitted under 

the Company’s Constitution (the “Constitution”). The Constitution also provides that the Board may make decisions and 

grant approval by way of written resolutions. A list of written resolutions approved by the Board and Board Committees 

is compiled and circulated during Board and Board Committee meetings. 

In line with the Company’s commitment to promote sustainable business practices, conservation of the environment 

and technological advancement, the Board has done away with voluminous hard-copy Board papers since 2014 and 

continues to employ board portal technologies to facilitate meeting proceedings. All materials for Board and Board 

Committees meetings are provided in a timely manner and uploaded onto the encrypted, secure board portal, which is 

readily accessible on Directors’ tablet devices, laptops or desktop computers. The board portal enhances effectiveness 

in the boardroom and helps to improve information flow to and amongst Board members. 

The record of Directors’ attendance at the Board and Board Committee meetings for FY2019 is set out on pages 98 to 

101 of this annual report.

Board Access to Information. Complete documents and adequate information relating to meeting agenda items, 

including background and explanatory notes, financial statements, budgets, forecasts and progress reports of the 

Group’s business operations and internal audit reports are circulated at least one week prior to each Board and/or Board 

Committee meeting through the board portal, to allow sufficient time for Directors to comprehensively understand the 

issues to be deliberated upon and make informed decisions thereon. Senior management personnel who can provide 

additional insights into the matters at hand, if required, will be invited to attend the meetings to address queries from 

the Directors. 

The Management provides monthly reports to the Board covering operational performance, financial results, market 

environment, treasury activities, corporate and business development and other relevant information to the Board, to 

assist the Board to make a balanced and informed assessment of the Company’s performance, position and prospects 

and to ensure that Directors are fully cognisant of the decisions and actions of the Management. Such regular updates 

and timely reports allow the Board to monitor the Group’s performance as well as Management’s performance relating 

to the goals and objectives set by the Board. All information requested by the Director is provided in a timely manner.

Directors have direct and independent access to Management and each member of the Board may request for 

information regarding the Group that is required for the discharge of his duties and responsibilities. The Directors also 

have separate and independent access to the Company Secretary at all times. The Company Secretary advises the 

Board on corporate and administrative matters, facilitates Director’s orientation and professional development, and 

ensures good information flow within the Board and Board Committees, and between Management and the Independent 

Directors. The Company Secretary or her colleague attends all Board and Board Committees meetings to ensure that 

Board procedures are followed and that the applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The appointment and 

removal of the Company Secretary are subject to the approval of the Board as a whole.

Where necessary, a Director may also seek independent legal and other professional advice concerning any aspect of 

the Group’s operations or undertakings at the Company’s expense.

Board Composition and Guidance

Taking into account the scope and nature of the Group’s operations as well as its strategic direction, and having 

regard to the Diversity Policy (as defined below), the Company and the Board are satisfied that the Board and Board 

Committees are of the right size for effective decision-making, has the appropriate balance and mix of skills, expertise, 

knowledge, experience and collectively possesses the necessary core competencies in diverse areas including 

accounting, finance, law, sustainability development, business and management, strategic planning and global business 

experience, for the Board to effectively discharge its duties. 

Board Composition. The Board presently consists of ten (10) members: a non-executive non-independent Chairman, two 

(2) executive Directors, five (5) independent directors and two (2) non-executive non-independent Directors. A majority 

of the Board comprise non-executive Directors with no management or business relationship with the Company. There 

is a strong and independent element on the Board, with the Independent Directors constructively challenge and assist in 

developing proposals on strategies. The Board continued to function effectively during the year and was able to exercise 

objective judgement on corporate affairs independently.

The Board has considered the recommendation of the Code which stipulates that the independent directors to make up 

a majority of the Board where the Chairman is not an independent director. With reference to the common board size 

of six (6) directors for Singapore-listed companies1 and discussions of the Board, the Board concluded that the current 

board composition (board size of ten (10) members with 50% of independent directors and 80% of non-executive 

directors) has high level of independence and with the right structure to enable the Board to function at optimum levels. 

Correspondingly, the Board will not increase its size to appoint an additional independent director at the near future. 

Board Diversity. The Company views diversity at the Board level as an essential element in supporting the attainment 

of its strategic objectives and its sustainable development. In accordance with the Code, the Board has documented 

its practices toward diversity under a Policy on Board Diversity (the “Diversity Policy”). The Diversity Policy promotes 

the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, endorses the principle that diverse Board should include and make 

good use of differences between the Directors in terms of professional experience, skills, knowledge, length of service, 

industry discipline, cultural and educational background, gender, age, ethnicity and other relevant factors. The Board 

recognises the potential merits of gender diversity in the boardroom and welcomes female directors on board. Where 

the candidates for appointment as director are relatively equivalent in their levels of required skills and experience, the 

Board is committed to advancing female candidates, in order to achieve gender diversity and add a broader perspective 

on the Board.

1 The Singapore Directorship Report 2019 published by Singapore Institute of Directors indicates that the most common size 

continues to be six (6) directors.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive responsible for 

managing the Company’s business. The roles of Chairman and the post of CEO are held by separate persons who 

are not related to each other in any manner, to ensure an appropriate checks and balances, increased accountability, 

and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision making where no one individual has unfettered powers of 

decision-making. The two (2) key roles have fundamentally disparate responsibilities and functions, but complement 

each other in the overall objective of creating value for Shareholders, and play vital roles in providing the Group with 

strong leadership and vision. 

Chairman. As the Chairman of the Board, Mr Liu Hongsheng leads and ensures the effectiveness of all general meetings 

and Board meetings. He is responsible for promoting culture of openness and debate of the Board, steering productive 

and comprehensive discussions between members of the Board and Management on strategic, business and other 

issues pertinent to the Group, as well as ensuring effective communication with Shareholders and other stakeholders. 

The Chairman takes a leading role in the Company’s drive to achieve and maintain a high standard of corporate 

governance with the support of the Board, Management and Company Secretary. 

CEO. Mr Robert Meyer, the CEO since 2013, has developed the Group’s business to become a leading natural rubber 

industry operator with activities that span the globe. He possesses in-depth industry knowledge, understands the 

current market, and has the foresight to support the formulation of the Group’s strategic direction, including the initiative 

to transition the global natural rubber industry, which remained heavily reliant on traditional paper-based processes, 

into a unified integrated digital marketplace which promote greater price transparency in the industry. Assisted by the 

management team, the CEO make decisions in all matters affecting the operations, performance and strategy of the 

Group’s businesses, with the exception of those matters reserved for the Board or specifically delegated by the Board to 

the Board committees. He oversees the day-to-day management, leads and implements all major initiatives and plays an 

instrumental role in the sustainable development and growth of the Group’s business. 

Lead Independent Director. Mr Alan Nisbet has been the Lead Independent Director since 2013 and continues to avail 

himself to address Shareholders’ concerns and acts as a counter-balance in the decision-making process. Shareholders 

and other stakeholders may approach the Lead Independent Director through the online enquiry form under the 

Company’s website, where all messages will be transmitted to him directly. The Lead Independent Director also plays an 

additional facilitative role within the Board and provides a channel to non-executive directors for confidential discussion 

on any concerns and to resolve conflicts of interest as and when necessary. He provides leadership in situation where 

the Chairman is conflicted, convenes and chairs meetings without the involvement of the Management, which enhance 

the capacity of the Board for independent decision making. 

The roles, duties and responsibilities of the Chairman, CEO, Lead Independent Director and Directors of different 

classes (executive, non-executive and independent director) are detailed under a Memorandum on Director’s Duties and 

Responsibilities which has been distributed to each Director upon his appointment, and accessible in the board portal.

Board Membership and Performance Evaluation

The Board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of Directors, taking 

into consideration the composition and the need for progressive renewal of the Board. The search, nomination and 

evaluation process is delegated to the NC.

The NC comprises three (3) members and is chaired by Mr Randolph Khoo since its inception in 2013. All members of 

the NC (including the chairman) are Independent Directors. The Lead Independent Director, Mr Nisbet, is also a member 

of the NC. The NC makes and reviews recommendations to the Board on all nominations for appointments and re-

appointments to the Board, the appointment of KMP, the training and development programmes for the Board, and is 

responsible for the annual evaluation of Board performance. 

The NC functions within clearly written terms of reference approved by the Board and its principal activities are as 

follows:

Board Appointment.The Board regularly and continually reviews its structure, size and composition to identify the 

balance of skills, knowledge and experience required for the Board to discharge its responsibilities effectively. Where 

appropriate, or if circumstances suggest that additional skills or experience is required and that a replacement and/

or new appointment is beneficial to the Board, the NC will propose a new appointment or review and evaluate the 

competencies of candidates proposed by the Management. The NC has a formal and written guide to conduct due 

diligence checks to assess the suitability of a candidate for appointment as a Director of the Company. To ensure 

the Company has the opportunity to benefit from all available talent, the evaluation of potential new director is made 

based on meritocracy, and candidates will be considered against objective criteria, having due regard for the benefits of 

diversity on the Board, the ability of prospective candidates to contribute to discussions, deliberations and activities of 

the Board as well as the balance of independent directors on the Board. 

In its review of proposal for appointment or re-appointment of each Director as well as KMP, NC will also take into 

consideration the composition and progressive renewal of the Board, as well as each Director’s competencies, 

principal commitment, contribution and performance (including attendance to the meeting, preparedness, participation 

and candour), including, if applicable, his or her performance as an independent director. Such appointment or re-

appointment which has been recommended by the NC will be deliberated by the Board as a whole, and the appointment 

are reserved for the Board’s decision. The Constitution also spells out the procedures for the appointment of new 

Directors, along with the re-election and removal of Directors. 

The NC is also tasked to recommend and review succession plans for the Company’s Directors and senior 

management, in particular for the Chairman, the CEO and the KMP, taking into account the challenges and opportunities 

facing the Group and the skills and experience needed in the future. The Company integrates executive development 

programs into CEO and KMP succession planning, and builds talent internally through training, so that the best internal 

candidates are identified early and flagged at the Board level. Where necessary or appropriate, the NC may tap on its 

networks and/or engage external professional headhunters to assist with identifying and shortlisting candidates. The 

NC can also approach relevant institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Directors, professional organisations or 

business federations to source for suitable candidates.

Review of Board Independence. The NC reviews and determines whether a Director is independent on an annual 

basis, and as and when circumstances require. Each of the Independent Directors has submitted a declaration form 

confirming that he is to be considered independent under the requirements of Rule 210(5)(d) of the Listing Manual as 

well as the provisions set out in the Code. Taking into consideration the declarations submitted by the Independent 

Directors, as well as the length that the Director has served on the Board, the NC has determined that each of the 

Independent Directors is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the Company, 

its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, and there has been no element that could interfere, 

or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Director’s independent business judgment in the best 

interests of the Group. It was also noted that none of the Independent Directors have served for a continuous period 

of nine (9) years or more, and none of them or their family members was employed by, or received significant payment 

from or provided material services to the Group, in FY2019 or in any of the past three (3) financial years.

Board Orientation, Training and Development. The NC oversees and makes recommendations to the Board for training 

and professional development programs available to Directors, as well as induction for newly appointed Directors. The 

Board has adopted a set of best practice for Director’s training and development which is documented under a Policy on 

Induction, Training and Development for Directors (the “Training Policy”).

The Training Policy serves (i) to assist the new Director who is appointed to the Board for the first time to gain an 

understanding of his or her roles, duties, obligations and responsibilities as a Director of the Company, as well as the 

framework within which the Group operates; and (ii) to encourage all Directors to regularly review his or her training 

and professional development needs, to ensure the Directors have appropriate competencies to effectively fulfill their 

responsibilities to the Company and its Shareholders as well as stakeholders. 

The induction programme is tailored for each new Director (depending on his or her requirements, skills, qualifications 

and experience) and will, as a mandatory requirement, request the new Director who has no prior experience as a 

director of a listed company to attend the Listed Entity Director (LED) Programme organised by the Singapore Institute 

of Directors with the support of the SGX-ST, to familiarise himself or herself with the roles and responsibilities of a 

director of a public listed company. A formal letter of appointment setting out the roles of a Director and the time 

commitment required, as well as information about the Group, its operations, business, practices and governance 

systems, is also issued to each newly appointed Director to ensure that the Director is aware if his duties and 

obligations.

To ensure each Director fulfils the needed and desired competencies of the Board, and keep abreast of changes to the 

regulatory environment, Directors are encouraged to attend courses which are relevant to the Directors in discharging 

their roles and responsibilities, at the Company’s expense. The list of available seminars and courses is circulated to 

Directors through the board portal. Reading materials in connection with professional developments and applicable 

regulatory updates or amendments to relevant laws, rules and regulations are also disseminated to Directors through 

the board portal. Comprehensive and useful information covering the duties and obligations of a Director, TOR of Board 

Committees, Group’s business activities, strategic directions, policies and key areas of operations of the Group, are also 

provided in the resource centre under the board portal, and is accessible to all Directors. All Directors would be offered 

the opportunity to visit the Group’s major operational sites and meet with any of the senior executives of the Group.

The CEO and Management regularly update the Board and provide insights on business and strategic developments at 

meetings. The Group’s external auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“EY”), regularly brief the AC members on changes to and 

new developments of accounting and reporting standards and/or regulatory environment.

Commitment to the Board. Directors of the Company are required to notify the Board of any new appointment of 

directorships to listed companies or other principal commitments, for the Board or NC to consider and to evaluate 

whether such Director is able to commit the time to adequately carried out his duties as a Director of the Company. 

To ensure that each Director is able to devote sufficient time and attention to carrying out his role in accordance with his 

duties, the Board has determined that the maximum number of listed company board representations each Director of 

the Company is allowed to hold is as follows: 

(a) 

directorships without other executive roles – Six (6)

(b) 

directorships with other executive roles – Four (4)

Rotation and Re-election of Directors. At each annual general meeting (“AGM”), Directors constitutes not less than 

one-third of the Board are required to retire from office by rotation, and a Director shall submit himself for re-nomination 

and re-election at regular intervals of at least once every three (3) years. These requirements are clearly stated in the 

Company’s Constitution and each member of the Board has submitted himself for re-nomination and re-appointment at 

least once, during the past three (3) years.

Mr Pascal Demierre, Mr Randolph Khoo, Mr Wang Wei and Mr Qin Jinke, being Directors who have been longest in office 

since their last election, have submitted themselves for re-nomination and re-election. Each of them has abstained 

himself from making any recommendation and/or participating in any deliberation in respect of the assessment of his 

own re-election as the Directors. At the recommendation of the NC and with the approval of the Board, resolutions for 

the re-appointment of Mr Demierre, Mr Khoo, Mr Wang and Mr Qin as Directors of the Company will be tabled at the 

forthcoming AGM for Shareholders’ approval. 

Each of the Directors subject to re-election at the forthcoming AGM, will, upon re-appointment as a Director, hold the 

same office in the Board and Board Committees immediately held before his re-appointment. For information required 

under Rule 720(6) and Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual in respect of the Directors seeking re-election at the AGM, 

please refer to pages 120 to 129 of this annual report.

Board Performance Evaluation. The NC decides how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and take charge of 

the annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of each Board Committee, as well as the 

contribution of the Chairman and each Director to the effectiveness of the Board. The performance of the Board 

and each of the Board Committee is assessed by the NC on its overall effectiveness in accomplishing its goals and 

discharging its responsibilities based upon the following criteria:

(a) 

Board size and composition; 

(b) 

Board governance processes; 

(c) 

Board information and accountability; 

(d) 

Board’s performance in relation to discharging its principal functions; 

(e) 

where practical, financial references which include return on capital employed, return on equity, debt/equity ratio, 

dividend pay-out ratio, economic value added, earnings per share, and total shareholder return (i.e. dividend plus 

share price increase over the year); and

(f) 

Board Committee performance, qualification and effectiveness in relation to discharging their responsibilities set 

out in their respective TOR.

The evaluation of Chairman aims to assess his leadership, commitment as well as his relationship with Board members, 

whereas the individual directors are evaluated based on his dedication and understanding of role, preparedness and 

participation in the meetings, as well as quality of inputs to matters deliberated by the Board.

A formal evaluation questionnaire was tabulated and circulated to all Directors via the board portal, for Directors to 

rate and provide feedback on the performance of the Board, the Board Committees, the Chairman and each Director 

for FY2019. The assessment provides insights into the functioning of the Board, whilst identifying areas that might 

need strengthening and development. Directors are invited to provide their views and suggestions for any specific areas 

where improvements may be made to improve Board effectiveness. Every Director is also requested to complete an 

assessment of each Director’s contributions, including himself, to the effectiveness of the Board, on anonymous basis.

The findings of the Board evaluation (including feedback and comments received from the Directors) are analysed and 

discussed by the NC, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board to identify areas for improvement and any training 

required to further enhance the effectiveness of the Board. The Board will then review feedback from the NC collectively 

and will decide and agree on action plans. 

Following the review for FY2019, the NC and the Board are satisfied that the Chairman as well as each Director has 

contributed to the overall effectiveness of the Board and demonstrates commitment to his roles on the Board, and 

that the Board and Board Committees operate effectively and have met their respective performance objectives. 

Notwithstanding that certain Directors have multiple board representations, these multiple directorships are 

not in conflict with the interests of the Company, and are within the maximum number of listed company board 

representations each Director of the Company is allowed to hold. No external facilitator was used in the evaluation 

process. 

Strategy and Investment Committee

The StratCom consists of three (3) members and chaired by the Board’s Chairman, Mr Liu. StratCom’s governing 

processes, duties and responsibilities have been documented under written TOR approved by the Board. StratCom 

supports the Board in the following areas:

(a) 

defining and monitoring the Company’s strategic direction;

(b) 

reviewing and evaluating significant capital deployment and asset management; and

(c) 

working with the Management to oversee and review significant strategic decisions as well as major investment 

or divestment plans. 

One (1) StratCom meeting was held in FY2019 to review the Group’s prospects and long-term development strategic 

planning.

 REMUNERATION MATTERS

The Company’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration are appropriate and 

proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Group, taking into account the strategic objectives 

of the Group. Reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on the framework of remuneration for the Board 

and KMP as well as the specific packages for each Director and the KMP, are the key functions of the RC.

Remuneration Committee

The RC is chaired by an Independent Director, Mr Liew, and comprises Mr Nisbet, Mr Khoo and Mr Demierre. The RC is 

of the view that an Executive Director would have a better understanding of each senior executive’s role and job scope, 

and that including Mr Demierre on the RC is valuable in ensuring that the remuneration packages are commensurate 

with the job duties and responsibilities of senior executives. Retaining an RC member who holds an executive 

position will not lead to a conflict of interest or impede the independence of the RC as no Director or member of the 

RC is allowed to participate in the deliberation, and has to abstain from voting on any resolution, relating to his own 

remuneration or that of employees related to him. RC’s TOR specify that independent directors shall make up at least 

75% of the RC members whenever its members comprise an Executive Director.

The key responsibilities and authorities of the RC are as follows:

Developing Group Remuneration Policies. The RC ensures that the remuneration and incentive framework, policies 

and practices are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Directors to provide good stewardship of the Company 

and KMP to successfully manage the Company for the long term. The RC considers all aspects of remuneration 

(including directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, share-based incentives and awards, benefits in kind 

and severance packages) and aims to be fair and avoid rewarding poor performance. It also reviews the Company’s 

obligations arising in the event of termination of the Executive Directors’ and KMP’s contracts of service, to ensure 

that such contracts contain fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous. It may from time 

to time, and where necessary or required, seek advice from external consultants in framing its remuneration policy and 

determining the level and mix of remuneration for Directors and KMP. 

In respect of long-term incentive schemes (if any, including share schemes as may be implemented), the RC is 

responsible for considering whether Directors should be eligible for benefits under such long-term incentive schemes. 

Any recommendation of the RC will be submitted to the Board for consideration and approval. The Board is ultimately 

accountable for all remuneration decisions.

Where applicable, the RC will also review annually the remuneration of employees related to the Directors, the CEO and 

substantial shareholders to ensure that their remuneration packages are in line with the staff remuneration guidelines 

and commensurate with their respective job scopes and level of responsibilities. The RC will also review and approve 

any bonuses, pay increases and/or promotions for these employees, if any. 

Other than the service contracts for the CEO and the COO, the Company currently does not impose contractual 

provisions to reclaim incentive components of remuneration paid in prior years in the service agreements or 

employment agreements of the KMP. Notwithstanding this, the Company is not precluded from exercising the right to 

reclaim such incentives in exceptional circumstances including for example, misstatement of financial results or of 

misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Group.

Agreeing the Level and Mix of Remuneration. The key considerations of the RC in recommending the level and mix of 

remuneration are:

(a) 

to link rewards with performance and offer appropriate remuneration and employment conditions to build, 

motivate and retain Directors, KMP and talent; 

(b) 

to align the interests of Directors and KMP with the interests of Shareholders and other stakeholders; 

(c) 

risk policies of the Company, such that the remuneration is symmetric with risk outcome and sensitive to the 

time horizon of risk, and

(d) 

country-specific practices including the pay and employment conditions within the industry.

Remuneration framework as well as specific remuneration packages which is tailored to the specific role and 

circumstances of each Director and KMP, including the CEO, are reviewed and discussed in the RC meeting. When it 

recommends the remuneration package to the Board, the RC takes into consideration the aforementioned factors, the 

strategic direction of the Group and industry practice, and benchmarks the remuneration package against relevant 

industry players to ensure an appropriate remuneration level and mix that recognises the performance, potential and 

responsibilities of these individuals. Specific remuneration packages for each Director in respect of FY2019 have been 

approved by the Board and is explicitly disclosed on a named basis, on pages 98 to 101 of this annual report.

Remuneration of Non-executive Directors. The Directors’ Fees for each non-executive Director which comprise a 

basic fee and attendance fees, is appropriate to the level of contribution, taking into account factors such as effort, 

time spent, and responsibilities. Directors’ Fees are reviewed annually by the RC to benchmark such fees against the 

amounts paid by other listed companies of similar size. No changes were proposed to the Directors’ Fees structure, and 

the Directors’ Fees structure for the financial year ending 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”) remains the same as FY2019, 

and is as follows:

The Company submits the quantum of Directors’ Fees of each financial year, which is to be paid quarterly in arrears, to 

Shareholders for approval at its AGM. Shareholders’ approval will be sought at the forthcoming AGM of the Company in 

respect of the proposed payment of Directors’ fees of up to S$750,000 (payable quarterly in arrears) for FY2020. 

Remuneration of Executive Directors and KMP. Performance measures and remuneration packages of the executive 

Directors and KMP are principally based on the achievement of the objectives of their functions as set up in the key 

performance indicators agreed by each individual, taking into consideration the scope of work, performance, potential 

and responsibilities of these individuals. Qualitative evaluation, such as vocational competence, responsibility at work 

and activity in the workplace, as well as the quality of work in relation to the demands and goals of duties, has also been 

used to evaluate and assess the Management’s performance in FY2019. 

In conjunction with developments in natural rubber market as well as convergence in quality requirement at 

consumers’ end, the operating segment of the Group has been further streamlined which led to a change in certain 

KMP’s designation and scope of responsibilities. Mr Ng Eng Kiat was appointed Managing Director of Halcyon Rubber 

Company (HRC) Group, which focuses on tyre major business whereas Mr Andrew Trevatt was appointed Chief 

Commercial Officer of Corrie MacColl Group, the business segment which manages plantation in Cameroon and 

Malaysia, as well as distribution business in Europe and the United States. The Company has three (3) KMP (who are 

not Directors or the CEO) for FY2019. Disclosure of their remuneration pursuant to the Code is as follows:

The total remuneration paid to the three (3) KMP (who are not Directors or the CEO) for FY2019 was approximately 

S$1,515,000, and has been approved by the Board. 

Summary of RC Observations for FY2019. The Group’s remuneration policies are appropriate, effective, meet the 

commercial requirements to remain competitive, are sensitive to the time horizon of risk and allow flexibility in response 

to prevailing circumstances, and align with the long-term interest of the Group. Currently, there are no employee share 

schemes provided by the Company or the Group, and the Company does not have any long-term incentive plans. None 

of the Directors and KMP received any termination, retirement and post-employment benefits. All Directors and the 

KMP are remunerated on an earned basis. There is no employee in the Group who is a substantial shareholder of the 

Company or immediate family member of a Director or the CEO or substantial shareholders. 

The Board is satisfied that the Directors and Management devoted the necessary time and energy to fulfilling their 

commitments, and have met the aforementioned performance conditions in FY2019. Having considered the prevailing 

circumstances and financial performance of the Company, the executive Directors have offered to waive their 

contractual bonus entitlement which is otherwise payable to them under the terms of their service agreements. The 

executive Directors and KMP (with the exception of the CFO) were not paid annual wage supplement or other variable 

allowances in FY2019, and their remuneration is solely made up of base salary. The CFO is rewarded variable bonus for 

effective fund management as well as providing strong financial coordination and expertise on the various financing 

initiatives under the demanding circumstances during the challenging year.

The Board is of the view that the Company’s remuneration decision for FY2019 aligns with the long-term interests of 

Shareholders and other stakeholders, as well as the risk management policy of the Company. The Company did not 

engage any remuneration consultants or professional firms in FY2019.

 ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

The Board is accountable and answerable to the Shareholders for all aspects of the Company. It endeavours to ensure 

that Shareholders are furnished with timely information, full disclosure of material information and aims to present a 

balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s performance, position and prospects to the Shareholders. 

The Board is responsible for the governance of risks and ensuring that effective system of risk management and 

internal controls is in place. Its function relating to overseeing both internal and external audits is delegated to the AC.

Risk Management and Internal Controls

The Board as a whole is responsible for the governance of risk and determines the nature and extent of the significant 

risks which the Company is willing to take in achieving its strategic objection and creating value for the Shareholders. 

It provides oversight in the design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management framework and policies, as 

well as the system of internal controls. The Board also ensures that Management puts in place action plans to mitigate 

the risks identified, and undertake remedial actions to rectify any control lapses. It devotes significant attention to 

maintaining an effective system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the investment of the Company 

and its Shareholders, and ensure that risks are managed in the best interests of the Group. The principal risks facing the 

Company are described under the section “Risk Management” on page 31 of this annual report.

In assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, the Board focuses on identifying control gaps in the 

business process, areas for improvement and areas where controls can be strengthened. This process assists in 

ensuring that primary key objectives are met, material assets are properly safeguarded, fraud or errors in the accounting 

records are prevented or detected, accounting records are accurate and complete, and reliable financial information 

is prepared in compliance with applicable internal policies, laws and regulations. The Company’s internal audits 

supplement the Group’s evaluation on all matters concerning internal controls including the assessment of any issue 

identified in the course of internal audit as well as the administration and implementation of the Group’s internal policies 

and procedures.

The Company has a dedicated team which is responsible for developing, monitoring and maintaining risk management 

controls and reporting any key issues to Management. A risk management committee (“RMC”) formed by the 

Management which comprises the CEO, Managing Director - HRC Group, Chief Commercial Officer - Corrie MacColl 

Group and CFO, is responsible to assess and determine the nature and extent of the financial risks which the Company 

is allowed to take. The Group Risk Management Policy which imposed appropriate measures and limits to control 

commercial risk exposures be reviewed regularly to ensure it is symmetric with market environment and Group’s 

operations. 

The internal controls practice of each of the Group’s functions is reviewed annually or when circumstances warrant 

the review process, such as during the integration process after completion of an acquisition, to enhance the standard 

operating procedures and ensure the newly acquired business is fully compliant with the Group’s policies and 

procedures. The Board’s commentary on the Company’s risk management and internal controls is set out on page 114 

of this Annual Report. 

Audit Committee

The AC is chaired by the Lead Independent Director, Mr Nisbet, and comprises Mr Liew, Mr Khoo and Mr Demierre. The 

members of the AC are professionals who have extensive experience in senior management positions, including two (2) 

retired audit partners from Big-four accounting firms with extensive accounting and financial management expertise. 

The AC members are therefore appropriately qualified to discharge their responsibilities. None of the AC members 

were previous partners or directors of the Company’s external audit firm within the last two (2) years and none of the 

AC members hold any financial interest in such external audit firm. The executive Director, Mr Demierre remained as 

a member of the AC after the enforcement of the Code which provides that the AC to comprise only non-executive 

Directors. The Board considered that the AC has discharge its functions effectively since its inception and the existence 

of an executive Director who knows the business contributes to a constructive relationship between Management and 

the AC, and will not hinder the independent judgement of the AC.

The main responsibility and objective of the AC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its financial and other oversight 

responsibilities by serving as an independent and objective party to oversee, monitor and appraise the integrity of 

the Company’s financial reporting process, the internal controls and risk management systems as well as the audits 

processes. Significant findings in the course of its reviews are reported to the Board. 

Pursuant to the written TOR endorsed by the Board, AC has the following key functions:

(a) 

oversight of financial reporting, monitor integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any public financial 

reporting;

(b) 

review the assurance provided by the CEO and the CFO on the financial records and financial statements;

(c) 

review and recommend to the Board, the appointment or re-appointment of the external auditors and matters 

relating to their removal, remuneration and terms of engagement;

(d) 

review and evaluate at least annually the adequacy, effectiveness, independence, scope and results of internal 

and external audits;

(e) 

review and report to the Board at least annually on the effectiveness and adequacy of the Company’s internal 

controls and risk management systems;

(f) 

review interested person transactions involving the Group in accordance with the Listing Manual;

(g) 

review and approve future hedging policy, instruments used for hedging and foreign exchange policy and practice 

of the Group; 

(h) 

review whistleblowing policy arrangement, lead the independent investigations and ensure appropriate follow-up 

actions, if any; and

(i) 

generally undertake such other functions and duties as may be required by the Listing Manual.

To ensure it could discharge its functions properly, AC has the explicit authority to investigate any matters within its 

TOR and has full access to and the cooperation of Management. The AC has full discretion to invite any Director or 

executive officer to attend any AC meeting to answer questions which the AC may have. It also has direct access to 

the Company’s external auditors and is conferred the authority to source external resources including obtaining legal 

or other professional advice and services. It may commission an independent audit on internal controls and risk 

management for its assurance, or where it is not satisfied with the systems of internal controls and risk management.

The AC performed, among others, the following core duties and activities in FY2019:

Financial Reporting. The Company’s financial results are prepared and presented in compliance with statutory 

requirements including applicable accounting standards and Listing Manual. The AC safeguards the integrity 

in financial reporting and ensures such reporting is in compliance with the requirements of the Singapore Financial 

Reporting Standards. It reviews all announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance, and oversees 

significant financial reporting issues and assessments, in particular, reviews the Group’s application and consistency 

of financial and accounting policies, judgments and practices. The AC, when satisfied that the financial results and 

related announcements meet statutory requirements, would submit and recommend the release of the financial results 

and related announcements to the Board. Any significant issues and judgement that AC considered in relation to the 

financial statements and the actions to address such concerns will also be reported to the Board. The Company’s 

quarterly and full year financial results are provided to Shareholders and published on the SGX-ST within the timeline 

stipulated under the Listing Manual, after they are approved by the Board.

Following the recent amendments to Rule 705 of the Listing Manual, the Board has decided to announce its financial 

statements on a half-yearly basis. The Company will continue to comply with its continuing disclosure obligations to keep 

the Shareholders updated when appropriate, should there be any material developments (financial or otherwise) relating 

to the Company or the Group.

External Audits. AC reviews the overall scope of external audits prior to each audit process, to ensure material areas 

are covered and sufficient attention is paid to higher risk areas. During the course of review of the Company’s financial 

statements for FY2019, the AC has discussed each of the key audit matters (“KAMs”) with the Management as well as 

EY. The AC has assessed and considered the Management’s approach, methodology and assumptions applied to each 

of the KAMs, and was satisfied with the appropriateness of the analyses performed by the Management. The AC agrees 

and concurs with the basis and conclusions included in EY’s report with respect to the KAMs. For more information on 

the KAMs, please refer to pages 133 to 134 of this annual report.

The scope and results of auditing by the Company’s external auditors, EY, its cost effectiveness, as well as its 

independence and objectivity are reviewed by the AC annually. The AC and the Board are satisfied that the aggregate 

amount of audit fees paid and/or payable to EY in connection with the audit as well as non-audit services for FY2019 

is appropriate. Having considered the relevant provisions under the applicable regulations, the cooperation extended by 

the Management and the fact that the non-audit services were provided by a separate team from EY, notwithstanding 

that the non-audit fees exceeded 50% of the total fees paid and/or payable to EY, AC is of the view that the 

independence or objectivity of EY is not impaired. For details of fees paid and/or payable to EY in respect of audit and 

non-audit services, please refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Financial Statements on page 169 of this annual report. 

Taking into consideration all relevant factors (with reference to the audit quality indicators as published by the 

Accounting and Regulatory Authority) including the adequacy of resources, experience of supervisory and professional 

staff to be assigned to the audit process, the quality of work carried out by EY, the size and complexity of the Group, 

its businesses and operations, AC has recommended that EY be re-appointed as the Company’s external auditors for 

FY2020. The appointment of external auditors of the Group complies with Rules 712 and 715 of the Listing Rules.

Internal audits. The Board believes that outsourcing the internal audit function to a professional firm is beneficial 

as the professional service provider has a broad range of expertise, resources, advanced degrees and technological 

specialisation to undertake the internal audit of the Group, especially for the Group’s business which has global 

presence.

AC decides on the appointment, termination and remuneration of Nexia TS Risk Advisory Pte Ltd (“Nexia”), the Group’s 

internal auditor since May 2013. To ensure that the review on internal controls is conducted effectively, Nexia’s primary 

reporting line is to the AC, and it is granted unfettered access to all the Company’s documents, records, properties and 

personnel. 

Internal audits are performed accordingly to the audit plan and scope agreed between Nexia and the AC. Nexia reviews, 

then evaluates and tests the effectiveness of the internal controls on material business process including financial, 

operational, compliance and information technology controls that are in place in each of the Group’s key operating units. 

The primary functions of the internal audit function are to:

(a) 

assess the relevant risks related to the Group’s business operations and evaluate if an adequate system of 

internal controls is in place to protect the funds and assets of the Group;

(b) 

assess if operations of the business processes under review are conducted efficiently and effectively and to 

ensure control procedures are complied with; and

(c) 

identify and recommend improvement to internal control procedures, where required.

Nexia presented the internal audit reports, which compile the detailed findings relevant to the Group’s key operating 

units which it had reviewed, to the AC during quarterly meetings. Any material non-compliance or failure in internal 

controls, recommendations for improvements and remedial actions taken by Management are reported to the AC. If 

action plans to mitigate the risks are required, the AC would instruct and ensure that Management undertakes follow-up 

actions. 

The AC reviews the adequacy, effectiveness, independence and scope of the internal audit function annually, including 

the internal audit plans, activities, budget for internal audit and organisational structure of Nexia. It believes that the 

internal audit conducted by Nexia for FY2019 attained professional standards, including those promulgated by The 

Institute of Internal Auditors. The AC is satisfied that the internal audit function has adequate resources given that there 

is a team of ten (10) members assigned to the Company’s internal audits, led by Ms Pamela Chan who has 13 years of 

relevant experience, and Nexia has appropriate standing within the Group during FY2019, and that the quantum of fee 

paid or payable to Nexia should not put its objectivity at risk. 

The AC (excluding Mr Demierre) meets with the internal and external auditors without the presence of Management 

at least once a year, to obtain feedback on the competency and adequacy of the finance function and to ascertain if 

there are any material weaknesses or control deficiencies in the Group’s financial reporting and operational systems.  

Mr Demierre, being an Executive Director, has been excluded from the aforesaid meeting(s) to ensure that the AC 

remains a platform for external and internal auditors to provide their independent opinions without the influence of 

Management. This safeguard is essential to ensure that the presence of an executive Director on the AC will not lead to 

any conflict of interest or impede the independence of the AC.

Governance of Risk. The AC is tasked to assist the Board to oversee Management in the design, implementation 

and monitoring of the internal controls and risk management systems. This includes identifying weaknesses and 

recommending areas for improvement and additional risk mitigations, where necessary. The Management reviews 

the conditions of the industry and any factors or events that may affect the Group’s operations, and presented its 

observation of the potential risks to the AC during quarterly meetings. Any material changes to the key risks areas are 

also reported to the AC as soon as they are identified. AC has reviewed the up-to-date risk register, the implementation 

and execution of standard operating procedures, as well as remedial actions recommended by the internal auditor and 

implemented by Management. The AC reports annually to the Board, its view on the effectiveness and adequacy of the 

Group’s internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk 

management systems.

Whistleblowing Framework. The Group has in place and has published on its website, a channel to raise concerns about 

any suspected improprieties. Its Whistleblowing Policy provides employees and third-parties a direct channel to the 

AC for the raising of concerns about any improprieties in matters of financial reporting, or other aspects in confidence 

and in good faith, without fear of reprisal. All whistleblowing matters come under the purview of the AC, to ensure 

independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action. The Whistleblowing Policy and its 

effectiveness will be reviewed by the AC periodically, with any recommendations regarding updates or amendments 

being made to the Board as required.

Interested Person Transactions (“IPT”). The AC reviews IPTs (if any) at its quarterly meetings and annually with 

the Company’s external auditors, to ensure that established procedures for monitoring the IPTs have been complied 

with. The AC is satisfied that the guidelines and review procedures established to review IPTs have been complied 

with in FY2019. Further information relating to the IPTs during FY2019 is provided under the section “Interested Person 

Transactions”.

Summary of the Board and AC’s Observations for FY2019. The Board is of the view that the AC comprises members 

with requisite qualifications and sufficient financial management expertise to discharge the AC’s functions competently. 

It has received assurances from the CEO and CFO that for FY2019:

(a) 

the Group’s financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair 

view of the Group’s operations and finances; and 

(b) 

the Group’s risk management and internal controls systems are adequate and effective in addressing the 

financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks of the Group. 

With the assurances from the CEO together with the CFO, and following its assessment on the following: 

(a) 

the reviews of the reports of Nexia;

(b) 

internal controls established and maintained by the Group; 

(c) 

remedial actions taken by the Management according to internal auditor’s recommendations; and

(d) 

reports from EY, 

the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Group’s present risk management and internal 

controls systems are adequate and effective in addressing the financial, operational, compliance and information 

technology risks of the Group. However, the Board notes that the risk management and internal controls provide 

reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatements of loss, and include the safeguarding of assets, 

the maintenance of proper accounting records, the reliability of financial information, compliance with appropriate 

legislation, regulation and best practice, and the identification and containment of business risk. The Board also notes 

that all internal control systems contain inherent limitations and no system of internal controls can provide absolute 

assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error losses, fraud or 

other irregularities.

 SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT

The Company’s corporate governance practices promote fair and equitable treatment of all Shareholders. Shareholders, 

as the owners of the Company, are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings, to a share of the Company’s profits 

and all other rights pursuant to The Companies Act (Chapter 50) of Singapore (the “Companies Act”) as well as the 

provisions of the Company’s Constitution.

Shareholder Rights and Conduct of Shareholder Meetings

The Company’s general meetings provide an opportune forum for Shareholders to meet the Board and senior 

management and to interact with them. It is the Company’s principal forum for dialogue with Shareholders. The 

Directors and Management actively engage Shareholders before and after general meetings, to understand the view 

of Shareholders, to gather inputs and address their concerns. General meetings are attended by all Directors whenever 

possible, and would normally be chaired by the Chairman of the Board. Chairmen of the Board Committees are also 

available at the meetings to answer any questions relating to the operations of the Board Committees. The Company’s 

external auditors are also present to address Shareholders’ queries about the conduct of audit and the preparation 

and content of the auditors’ report. The participation of Shareholders was encouraging and Shareholders actively 

communicated their views in the general meeting which was held in FY2019.

Updates on the Company’s performance and position are presented to the Shareholders in the general meetings, and 

such presentation materials are made available on the SGX-ST and the Company’s website prior to the meetings, for the 

benefit of the Shareholders.

Shareholders are properly informed of the meeting schedule and the agenda of meeting at least 14 or 21 days (as 

the case may be) prior to the date appointed for the general meeting. The notice of general meeting issued to all 

Shareholders is advertised in newspapers and disseminated through SGXnet, as well as published on the Company’s 

website.

Rules (including the appointment of proxy(ies) and voting procedures) that govern the attendance for general 

meetings are clearly set out in the notice of general meeting as well as the proxy form. Pursuant to the Constitution, 

every Shareholder is entitled to attend and vote at the general meetings of the Company and is allowed to appoint not 

more than two (2) proxies to vote on his/her behalf at the general meetings during his/her absence. Notwithstanding, 

specified intermediaries such as CPF, banks and capital market services license holders which provide custodial 

services are allowed to appoint multiple proxies. 

Sufficient and necessary information required for Shareholders to make informed decisions is provided or accompanied 

by the notice convening each general meeting. At general meetings, each issue is proposed as a separate resolution 

and Shareholders are given the right to express their views and exercise their voting rights on each resolution to be 

debated and decided upon. The Company has mandated poll voting since 2014. The polling agent appointed by the 

Company will explain the rules and tabulation procedures used for poll voting at the Company’s general meetings, 

before the polling starts. At each general meeting, an independent scrutineer is appointed to count and validate the 

votes prior to declaration of poll results by the Chairman. Details on voting outcomes including the number of votes 

cast for and against together with the respective percentages are displayed on-screen immediately after voting on 

each resolution is closed. Such results also be announced to the public through SGXnet in accordance with the format 

prescribed under the Listing Manual.

The proceedings of general meetings, including significant comments or queries from Shareholders relating to the 

agenda of the meeting, and responses from the Board and Management are properly recorded. Minutes of general 

meetings are available to Shareholders upon request.

The record of Directors’ attendance at the general meeting held in FY2019 is set out on pages 98 to 101 of this annual 

report.

The Board noted that the Ministry of Finance will review the Companies Act to expressly provide for the use of digital 

means for companies to conduct meetings and interact with stakeholders. Accordingly, the Board will review the need to 

amend the Constitution to allow for, among other, the absentia voting at general meetings, at an appropriate time.

Dividend Policy. The Company currently does not have a fixed dividend policy, to allow greater flexibility on the capital 

management. It continually reviews strategic options to enhance shareholders value, including potential acquisitions 

or realisation of assets. As any of such strategic actions would affect the allocation of fund, the Company decided 

to review and/or determine its dividend policy at the most appropriate time. The Company recorded a net loss and 

consequently no dividend has been declared or recommended in respect of FY2019 .

Engagement with Shareholders

The Company recognises that effective communication with investors assists the creation and maintenance of 

an informed market, and enhances corporate governance by encouraging a culture of transparency in relation to its 

corporate activities and proposals. The Company gives Shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its 

performance, position and prospects. It is the policy of the Board that all Shareholders are informed in a comprehensive 

and timely manner on all major or material developments that have an impact on the Group. To facilitate Shareholders’ 

rights and to ensure fair communication with the Shareholders, all information about the Company’s new initiatives 

which would be likely to materially affect the price or value of the Company’s shares are promptly disseminated to 

Shareholders through the following platforms:

(a) 

SGXnet announcements and news release;

(b) 

Annual Report and notice of general meetings issued to all shareholders; 

(c) 

press releases on major developments of the Group;

(d) 

the Company’s general meeting; and

(e) 

the corporate website (http://www.halcyonagri.com) maintained by the Company that allows all stakeholders to 

stay informed of material updates in a timely manner.

The Company has in place an Investor Relations Policy which allows for an ongoing exchange of views so as to actively 

engage and promote regular, effective and fair communication with Shareholders. The Company employs various 

platforms, including briefing for analysts after the release of its quarterly financial results, to effectively engage the 

Shareholders and the investment community, with an emphasis on timely, accurate, fair and transparent disclosure of 

information. Shareholders or public may ask questions relating to the Company through the online submission form 

under the Company’s website.

important dates and recapitulate any big announcements. Materials relating to the Group including the financial results, 

press releases, annual reports and various other investor-related information are also available on the corporate 

website.

The Group’s efforts in upholding the highest standards of corporate governance have been recognised by the 

Singapore Corporate Awards 2019, with the Company being awarded the Gold Award for Best Annual Report in the 

category for listed companies with market capitalisation of below S$1 billion. This award recognises the extent and 

quality of voluntary disclosures in the Company’s annual reports, honours SGX-listed companies as well as individuals 

who, through their corporate practices, have helped to raise Singapore’s corporate disclosure standards and corporate 

governance.

Engagement with Stakeholders 

Ethical and ecologically sustainable business practices are fundamental to the Company’s strategy for long-term 

growth. The Board remains committed to working with stakeholders and engages them at all levels including 

customers, competitors, industry associations, employees, regulators, and suppliers. The Company adopts an 

inclusive approach by considering and balancing the needs and interests of material stakeholders, as part of its overall 

responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the Company are served. It has arrangements in place to identify and 

engage with the material stakeholder groups.

major initiatives which aims to connect natural rubber stakeholders in the rubber industry, supports the Company’s 

commitment towards a more sustainable rubber industry. HeveaConnect digital marketplace aims to promote greater 

price transparency in the natural rubber market, and serves as an all-inclusive platform for farmers, producers, tyre

be the leading digital marketplace for sustainable natural rubber and a trading platform, which promotes eco-friendly 

practices and embraces supply chain transparency. 

Other information on the Group’s corporate social responsibility initiatives and engagements with material stakeholder 

groups is set out in pages 41 to 83 of this annual report.

 DEALING IN SECURITIES

The Company observes and complies with Rule 1207(19) of the Listing Rules on dealings in securities and issues 

quarterly notices in FY2019 to its Directors, officers and employees on the restrictions in dealing in the Company’s 

securities during the period commencing two (2) weeks before the announcement of the Company’s financial results for 

each of the first three quarters of its financial year, and one (1) month before the announcement of the Company’s full-

year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. Notices prohibiting dealing 

in Company securities will also be sent to the Group’s Directors, officers and employees as and when circumstances 

are deemed appropriate, such as when a discussion relating to an acquisition is expected to take a long period of time 

before it achieves certainty. 

Following the Board’s decision to cease quarterly financial reporting, the restrictions in dealing in the Company’s 

securities shall commence one (1) month before the publishing of the Company’s half year and full year financial 

statements.

Directors, officers and employees are reminded periodically not to trade in the Company’s securities at any time while in 

possession of unpublished price sensitive information, and to refrain from dealing in the Company’s securities on short-

term considerations. They are also advised to be mindful of the laws on insider-trading at all times even when dealing in 

securities within the permitted trading period.

 INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 

The Group does not have a general mandate from Shareholders for IPTs. The assessment of IPTs is under the purview 

of the AC, to ensure that any transaction to be entered into with interested persons (as defined in the Listing Manual) 

will be assessed independently, and that the transaction is carried out on normal commercial terms and are not 

prejudicial to the interests of the Company or its minority Shareholders. 

Any contract to be made with an interested person will not be proceeded with unless the pricing is determined in 

accordance with the Group’s usual business practices and policies, consistent with the usual margin given or price 

received by the Group for the same or substantially similar type of transactions with the unrelated parties, and that 

the terms are not more favourable to the interested person than those extended to or received from unrelated parties. 

Where it is impractical or not possible to compare against the terms of other transactions with unrelated third parties 

or in situations where the products or services may be purchased only from an interested person, such IPT must be 

reviewed and approved by the AC, and the AC member who is perceived to be related to the interest person is refrained 

from deliberating, reviewing and approving that particular transaction. A review on all IPTs entered into by the Group  

(if any), will be incorporated into the Group’s internal audit plan. 

 

During FY2019, there were no IPTs which were more than S$100,000 entered into by the Group or subject to Rules 905, 

906 and 907 of the Listing Manual. 

 MATERIAL CONTRACTS

Other than the service agreements entered into with the CEO and the COO, there were no material contracts (including 

loans) entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries involving the interest of the CEO, any Directors, or 

controlling shareholders which are either still subsisting at the end of FY2019 or if not then subsisting, entered into 

since the end of the previous financial year ended 31 December 2018.

Key audit matters (cont’d)

1. 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how (cont’d)

 

We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures concerning those key assumptions to which the outcome of 

the impairment test is most sensitive, as well as changes to CGUs during the year. The disclosures on goodwill 

and process know-how and key assumptions are included in Note 11. 

2. 

Measurement of biological assets 

 

The Group has rubber plantations for which the latex and rubber trees are subject to valuation. In December 

2019, as disclosed in Note 3.1(a), the Group has reclassified Cameroon plantation as non-bearer plant measured 

at fair value less cost of disposal. A gain of US$52,698,000 was recorded on the date of reclassification in the 

financial year ended 31 December 2019.

 

As at 31 December 2019, biological assets of the Group amounted to US$299,466,000 (2018: US$10,225,000). 

These biological assets, where significant, are fair valued by professional independent valuers engaged by the 

Group using industry/market accepted valuation methodology. Due to the measurement of fair value being 

inherently judgement and significance of the amount, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

 

We had obtained the valuation of biological assets prepared by independent professional valuers engaged by 

the Group. The fair value reports are reviewed by us together with our valuation specialists for appropriateness 

of the fair value methodology used and reasonableness of the assumptions used which include forecast cash 

flows, discount rates and yield rates for the plantation and market prices of the latex and log. We assessed the 

competence, capability and objectivity of the independent professional valuers and assessed the reasonableness 

of their conclusions having regard to the key assumptions mentioned above.

 

For Cameroon plantation, we discussed with management on the change of business model during the year, and 

corroborate the discussion to business plan and feasibility studies carried out by management. We reviewed 

management’s accounting treatment of fair value gain on the date of reclassification in accordance with  

SFRS(I) 1-41.

Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 

annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 

so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we 

conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 

nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 

with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls 

sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or 

disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation 

of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a 

going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 

accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic 

alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Report on the audit of the financial statement

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 

(collectively, the “Group”), which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 

31 December 2019, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 

consolidated cash flow statement of the Group and the statements of changes in equity of the Group and the Company 

for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the statement of financial position 

and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the 

Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to 

give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as 

at 31 December 2019 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated 

cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSA”s). Our responsibilities under those 

standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of 

our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority 

(“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) 

together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we 

have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe 

that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 

financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 

section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 

procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. 

The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis 

for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

1. 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how 

 

As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s goodwill and process know-how amounted to US$286,379,000 and 

US$10,000,000 respectively. These represent approximately 50% of the Group’s net assets. 

 

We focused on the impairment assessment of goodwill and process know-how because the impairment testing 

of the cash generating units (“CGUs”) attributable to these intangibles rely on estimates of value-in-use (“VIU”) 

based on the CGU’s expected future cash flows. We considered audit of these cash flow projections to be a 

key audit matter as these involved significant management judgment, and are based on assumptions that are 

affected by expected future market and economic conditions. In addition, judgment has also been exercised by 

management in identifying the appropriate CGUs for the impairment test. 

 

The Group uses assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions such as forecasted rubber 

price, forecasted sales volume, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates. We assessed and tested these 

assumptions which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive and data inputs by comparing them to 

historical performance of the CGU and industry outlook reports. We engaged our valuation specialists to assist 

us with the audit of the reasonableness of management’s valuation methodologies and certain assumptions 

used. 

 

We also reviewed the Group’s process in identifying changes to CGUs to which goodwill and/or intangible assets 

have been allocated to. We obtained and evaluated management’s sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of 

reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and we performed our own independent sensitivity calculations 

to quantify the downside changes to management’s models required to result in an impairment.

provisions of the Act.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 

SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 

decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

l 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 

fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

l 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 

appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 

Group’s internal control.

l 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 

related disclosures made by management.

l 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 

the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 

significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 

exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 

statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 

evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 

Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

l 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 

and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 

fair presentation.

l 

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 

activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the 

direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 

significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 

audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 

or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 

of such communication.

The Group has lease contracts for various items of plant, machinery, vehicles and other equipment. 

Before the adoption of SFRS(I) 16, the Group classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the inception date 

as either a finance lease or an operating lease. Refer to Note 2.21 Leases for the accounting policy prior 

to 1 January 2019.

 

 

Upon adoption of SFRS(I) 16, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all 

leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Refer to Note 2.21 Leases for the 

accounting policy beginning 1 January 2019. The standard provides specific transition requirements and 

practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group.

 

 

Leases	previously	classified	as	finance	leases

 

 

The Group did not change the initial carrying amounts of recognised assets and liabilities at the date 

of initial application for leases previously classified as finance leases (i.e., the right-of-use assets and 

lease liabilities equal the lease assets and liabilities recognised under SFRS(I) 1-17). The requirements of 

SFRS(I) 16 were applied to these leases from 1 January 2019.

1. 

Corporate information

 

Halcyon Agri Corporation Limited (the “Company”) is a public limited liability company incorporated and 

domiciled in Singapore and is listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.

 

The registered office of the Company is located at 180 Clemenceau Avenue, #05-02 Haw Par Centre, Singapore 

239922.

 

As at 31 December 2019, the Company is 54.99% owned by Sinochem International (Overseas) Pte. Ltd, a 

company incorporated and domiciled in Singapore. The penultimate holding company is Sinochem International 

Corporation Co., Ltd. (“SIC”), which is domiciled in the People’s Republic of China and listed on the Shanghai 

Stock Exchange. SIC is 55.76% indirectly owned by 中国中化集团公司 (also known as Sinochem Group) 

(“ultimate holding company”), a state-owned enterprise of the People’s Republic of China. 

 

The principal activity of the Company is investment holding. The principal activities of the subsidiaries and 

associates are disclosed in Note 14(a) and Note 14(b) to the financial statements respectively.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies

2.1 

(a) Basis of preparation

 

The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of 

changes in equity of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting 

Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”).

 

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting 

policies below.

 

The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“USD” or “US$”) and all values in the tables are 

rounded to the nearest thousand (“US$’000”) unless otherwise indicated.

 

New accounting standards effective on 1 January 2019

 

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those previously applied under FRS except that in the 

current financial year, the Group has adopted all the SFRS(I) which are effective for annual financial periods 

beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Except for the impact arising from the matters described below, the 

adoption of these standards did not have any material effect on the financial performance or position of the 

Group and the Company. 

 

i) 

SFRS(I) 16 Leases

 

 

SFRS(I) 16 supersedes SFRS(I) 1-17 Leases and SFRS(I) INT 4 Determining whether an Arrangement 

Contains a Lease, SFRS(I) INT 1-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SFRS(I) INT 1-27 Evaluating the 

Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for 

the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to recognise 

most leases on the balance sheet.

 

 

Lessor accounting under SFRS(I) 16 is substantially unchanged from SFRS(I) 1-17. Lessors will continue 

to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in SFRS(I) 1-17. 

Therefore, SFRS(I) 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor.

 

 

The Group adopted SFRS(I) 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of 

initial application of 1 January 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with 

the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. The 

Group elected to use the transition practical expedient to not reassess whether a contract is, or contains 

a lease at 1 January 2019. Instead, the Group applied the standard only to contracts that were previously 

identified as leases applying SFRS(I) 1-17 and SFRS(I) INT 4 at the date of initial application.

Date to be

The directors expect that the adoption of the other standards above will have no material impact on the financial 

statements in the period of initial application.

2.3 

Basis of consolidation and business combinations 

 

(A) 

Basis of consolidation

 

 

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its 

subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date 

as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar 

circumstances.

 

 

All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group 

transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

 

 

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains 

control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

 

 

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit 

balance.

 

 

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity 

transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

 

 

- 

de-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying 

amounts at the date when control is lost;

 

 

- 

de-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;

 

 

- 

de-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;

 

 

- 

recognises the fair value of the consideration received;

 

 

- 

recognises the fair value of any investment retained;

 

 

- 

recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;

 

 

- 

re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive 

income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.

SFRS(I) 16 Leases (cont’d)

 

 

Leases previously accounted for as operating leases

 

 

The Group recognised right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously classified as 

operating leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The right-of-use assets for 

most leases were recognised based on the carrying amount as if the standard had always been applied, 

apart from the use of incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. In some leases, the 

right-of-use assets were recognised based on the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted for any 

related prepaid and accrued lease payments previously recognised. Lease liabilities were recognised 

based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing 

rate at the date of initial application.

 

 

The Group also applied the available practical expedients wherein it:

 

 

l 

Used a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics

 

 

l 

Relied on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial 

application

 

 

l 

Applied the short-term leases exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months of 

the date of initial application

 

 

l 

Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of 

initial application

 

 

l 

Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contained options to extend or 

terminate the lease

 

 

The lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 

December 2018, as follows:

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.6 

Associates

 

An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 

decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.

 

The Group account for its investments in associates using the equity method from the date on which it becomes 

an associate. On acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share 

of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included 

in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s 

identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of 

the entity’s share of the associate’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

 

Under the equity method, the investment in associates are carried in the statement of financial position at cost 

plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates. The profit or loss reflects the 

share of results of the operations of the associate. Distributions received from associates reduce the carrying 

amount of the investment. Where there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income by the 

associates, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensive income. Unrealised gains 

and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the 

interest in the associates.

 

When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does 

not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

 

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional 

impairment loss on the Group’s investment in associate. The Group determines at the end of each reporting 

period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the 

case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 

associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss.

 

The financial statements of the associates are prepared as the same reporting date as the Company. Where 

necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

2.7 

Foreign currency

 

The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar (“USD”), which is also the Company’s functional 

currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial 

statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

 

(a)	

Transactions	and	balances

 

 

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company 

and its subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange 

rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 

in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling as at the statement of financial 

position date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 

translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. 

 

 

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the 

end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.

 

(b)	

Consolidated	financial	statements

 

 

For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into USD at the 

rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date and their profit or loss are translated 

at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on 

the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the 

component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in 

profit or loss.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.3 

Basis of consolidation and business combinations (cont’d)

 

(B) 

Business combinations and goodwill

 

 

Where a business combination involves entities or businesses under common control, it is outside the 

scope of SFRS(I) 3 and may be accounted for using the pooling of interest method or the acquisition 

method. Acquisition method is applied when the transaction has substance from the perspective of the 

Group in accordance with SFRS(I) 3.

 

 

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired 

and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 

acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs 

are incurred and the services are received.

 

 

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed 

to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-39 either in profit or loss or as 

a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not 

remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

 

 

The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non-controlling interest in the 

acquiree (if any), that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share 

of net assets in the event of liquidation, is recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-

controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Other components of 

non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement 

basis is required by another SFRS(I).

 

 

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the 

amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previously 

held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets 

and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.11(a). In 

instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain 

purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.

2.4 

Transactions with non-controlling interests

 

Non-controlling interests represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of 

the Company.

 

Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 

for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling 

interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between 

the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or 

received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

2.5 

Subsidiaries

 

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or 

has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 

through its power over the investee.

 

In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less 

impairment losses.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.10 

Investment properties

 

Investment properties are properties that are owned by the Group that are held to earn rentals or for capital 

appreciation, or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative 

purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. Investment properties comprise completed investment 

properties and properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties. 

Properties held under operating leases are classified as investment properties when the definition of an 

investment property is met.

 

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.

 

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from 

changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.

 

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property 

is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains 

or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the year of 

retirement or disposal.

2.11 

Intangible assets

 

(a)	

Goodwill

 

 

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 

accumulated impairment losses.

 

 

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the 

acquisition date, allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from 

the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 

assigned to those units.

 

 

The cash-generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairment annually and 

whenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined 

for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-

generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 

is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses 

recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

 

 

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that cash-generating 

unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying 

amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill 

disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operations disposed 

of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

 

(b) 

Other intangible assets

 

 

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets 

acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial 

acquisition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 

impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, 

are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the year in which the expenditure is 

incurred.

 

 

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

 

 

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for 

impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation 

period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the 

expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the 

asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as 

changes in accounting estimates.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.8 

Property, plant and equipment

 

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant 

and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 

The cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs that are 

directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying property, plant and equipment. 

The accounting policy for borrowing costs is set out in Note 2.18. The cost of an item of property, plant and 

equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 

the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

 

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group 

recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, 

when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment 

as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in 

profit or loss as incurred.

 

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Leasehold improvements and renovation

–

10 years

Office equipment

–

2 years

Computers and software

–

1 to 5 years

Leasehold buildings

–

20 years

Plant and machinery

–

10 years

Vehicles

–

4 to 10 years

Leasehold land

–

20 to 95 years

 

Freehold land is not depreciated. 

 

Assets under construction included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not 

yet available for use.

 

Plantation establishment costs, consisting of costs directly incurred during the period of plantation development, 

are not depreciated. The establishment costs will be transferred to plantation assets and will be subject to 

depreciation upon commencement of rubber tapping activities. 

 

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

 

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjusted 

prospectively, if appropriate.

 

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 

expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on de-recognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in 

the year the asset is derecognised.

2.9 

Land use rights

 

Certain plantation lands in Cameroon were given land use rights by the State of Cameroon in 1996 for a period 

of 50 years plus 50 years, renewable at a nominal value to the Group. With the Group’s continuing investment 

in replanting and extension on the plantation land, the Group is of the view that it is not likely that the land use 

rights will not be renewed at the expiring of its current term. The land use rights is depreciated over its remaining 

useful life of 78 years.

2.12 

Bearer plants and biological assets (cont’d)

 

Financial	year	ended	31	December	2019

 

Bearer plants consist of the oil palm trees in the Malaysian plantation and rubber trees in Ivory Coast 

plantation. Cultivation of seedlings is stated at cost. The accumulated cost will be classified as 

immature plantations at the time of planting. Mature plantations are stated at cost less accumulated 

depreciation and impairment. The Group concluded that depreciating the mature plantations by the 

expected yield pattern of the bearer plants over their useful lives, estimated at 30 years, is more 

reflective of the pattern in which the assets future benefit are expected to be consumed. The carrying 

value of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 

that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A bearer plant is derecognised upon disposal or 

when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 

derecognition of the bearer plant is included in the profit or loss when the bearer plant is derecognised.  

 

Biological assets consist of rubber latex and rubber trees in the Malaysian and Cameroonian plantations, 

produce that grows on oil palm trees in the Malaysian plantations and rubber latex in Ivory Coast plantation. 

These are measured at fair value less estimate costs to sell. Gains or losses arising on initial recognition of 

plantations at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Gains or losses arising on initial recognition  of plantations 

at fair value less estimated costs to sell of plantations at each reporting date are included in profit or loss for the 

period in which they arise. 

 

Refer Note 3.1(a) on the reclassification of the Cameroon rubber plantations during the financial year. Fair value 

gain arising from reclassification of rubber trees from bearer plants to non-bearer plants is recognised in profit or 

loss in the year of reclassification.

2.13	

Impairment	of	non-financial	assets

 

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 

indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of 

the asset’s recoverable amount.

 

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of 

disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 

inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount 

of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 

written down to its recoverable amount. 

 

The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared 

separately for each of the Group’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These 

budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term 

growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.

 

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in profit or loss.

 

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any 

indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such 

indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously 

recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 

the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying 

amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount 

that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously.

2.11 

Intangible assets (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Other intangible assets (cont’d)

 

 

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, 

or more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either 

individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life 

of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful 

life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is 

made on a prospective basis.

 

 

Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference 

between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or 

loss when the asset is derecognised.

 

 

(i) 

Process know-how

 

 

 

The useful life of the process know-how was estimated to be indefinite because based on the 

current demand for rubber, management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period over 

which the process know-how are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.

 

 

(ii) 

Customer relationship

 

 

 

Customer relationship acquired was initially recognised at cost and was subsequently carried 

at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These costs are 

amortised to the income statement using the straight line method over 10 years.

 

 

(iii) 

Computer software

 

 

 

Acquired computer software licences are initially capitalised at cost and was subsequently carried 

at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These costs are 

amortised to the income statement using the straight line method over 5 years. 

2.12 

Bearer plants and biological assets

 

The classification of rubber trees as bearer plant or non-bearer plant depends on the business plan for respective 

rubber plantations, pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the trees, plantation and relevant market or 

industry considerations. Rubber trees are not considered bearer plant when there is commercial viable plan to 

sell the rubber tree as lumber at the end of the rubber production life to an established market. 

 

Financial	year	ended	31	December	2018

 

Bearer plants consist of the oil palm trees in the Malaysian plantation and rubber trees in Cameroon and Ivory 

Coast plantations. Cultivation of seedlings is stated at cost. The accumulated cost will be classified as immature 

plantations at the time of planting. Mature plantations are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 

impairment. The Group has reassessed its depreciation methodology for plantation assets as its significant 

investment in bearer plants over the last few years is starting to reach maturity. The Group concluded that 

depreciating the mature plantations by the expected yield pattern of the bearer plants over their useful 

lives, estimated at 30 years, is more reflective of the pattern in which the assets future benefit are expected 

to be consumed. The carrying value of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A bearer plant is derecognised upon 

disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 

derecognition of the bearer plant is included in the profit or loss when the bearer plant is derecognised.

 

Biological assets consist of rubber trees in the Malaysian plantations and produce that grows on oil palm trees 

in the Malaysian plantations, and rubber latex in the Cameroon and Ivory Coast plantation. These are measured 

at fair value less estimate costs to sell. Gains or losses arising on initial recognition of plantations at fair value 

less estimated costs to sell and from the changes in fair value less estimated costs to sell of plantations at each 

reporting date are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

Financial instruments (cont’d)

 

(a)	

Financial	assets (cont’d) 

 

 

 

 

De-recognition

 

 

A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has 

expired. On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount 

and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in 

other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss.

 

(b)	

Financial	liabilities

 

 

Initial recognition and measurement

 

 

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual 

provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at 

initial recognition.

 

 

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair 

value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

 

 

Subsequent measurement

 

 

After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss are 

subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are 

recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process. 

 

 

De-recognition

 

 

A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 

expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially 

different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 

modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and 

the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.

 

(c)	

Gain/loss	on	commodity	contracts

 

 

Commodity contracts to buy and sell natural rubber commodities can be subject to net settlement if 

market conditions are favourable. Such commodity contracts and derivative financial instruments are 

marked to market at market rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Unrealised gains or losses 

are taken to profit or loss. Market value is generally based on listed market prices. If listed market prices 

are not available, market value is determined based on relevant factors, including trade price quotations, 

time value and volatility factors underlying the commodities and price quotations for similar commodities 

traded in different markets, including markets located in different geographical areas.

2.15	

Impairment	of	financial	assets

 

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held 

at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due 

in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an 

approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the 

sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. 

 

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in 

credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that resulted from default events that 

are possible within the next 12 months (a 12 month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been 

a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for credit losses 

expected over the remaining life of the exposures, irrespective of timing of the default (an ECL).

Financial instruments

 

(a)	

Financial	assets

 

 

Initial recognition and measurement

 

 

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual 

provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at 

initial recognition.

 

 

When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial 

assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Transaction costs of 

financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. 

 

 

Trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled 

in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on 

behalf of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial 

recognition. 

 

 

Subsequent measurement

 

 

Debt instruments

 

 

(i) 

Amortised cost

 

 

 

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows 

represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial 

assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains 

and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or impaired, and 

through the amortisation process. 

 

 

(ii) 

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

 

 

 

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial 

assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are 

measured at FVOCI. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair 

value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in 

other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses 

and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The 

cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from 

equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is de-recognised. 

 

 

(iii) 

Fair value through profit or loss

 

 

 

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value 

through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt instruments that is subsequently measured at fair 

value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss 

in the period in which it arises. 

 

 

Investments in equity instruments

 

 

On initial recognition of an investment in equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may 

irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. Dividends from such investments 

are to be recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. For 

investments in equity instruments which the Group has not elected to present subsequent changes in fair 

value in OCI, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

 

 

Derivatives

 

 

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date of derivative contract is entered into and are 

subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in fair value of 

derivatives are recognised in profit or loss.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 

2.20	

Employee	benefits

 

(a)	

Retirement	benefit	costs

 

 

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense when employees 

have rendered the services entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed 

retirement benefit schemes, such as the Singapore Central Provident Fund, are dealt with as payments to 

defined contribution plans where the group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in 

a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

 

 

For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the 

Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting 

period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset 

ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the 

statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in 

the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected 

immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Service costs which include 

current service cost, past service cost and gains or losses on non-routine settlement are recognised 

as expense in profit or loss. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate based on high 

quality long term bonds at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Net 

interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognised as expense or income in profit or loss

 

 

Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:

 

 

l 

Service cost;

 

 

l 

Net interest expense or income of the net retirement benefit obligation; and

 

 

l 

Re-measurements of net retirement benefit obligation

 

 

The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss in the line item 

‘Employee benefit expense’. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.

 

 

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position represents the actual 

deficit or surplus in the group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is 

limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or 

reductions in future contributions to the plan.

 

 

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw 

the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

 

(b) 

Employee leave entitlement

 

 

Employees’ entitlement to annual leave is recognised as a liability when they are accrued to the 

employees. The undiscounted liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after 

the end of the reporting period is recognised for services rendered by employees up to the end of the 

reporting period.

2.21 

Leases

 

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 

conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

 

Group	as	a	lessee

 

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases 

and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use 

assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 

2.15	

Impairment	of	financial	assets	(cont’d)

 

For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore the Group does 

not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on ECLs at each reporting date. 

The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for 

forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. 

 

For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every 

reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all 

reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, 

the Group reassess the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group considers that there 

has been a significant increase in credit risk when the contractual payments are more than 90 days past due. 

 

The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 365 days past due. However, 

in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal and external 

information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before 

taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no 

reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. 

2.16 

Cash and cash equivalents

 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short term deposits that are readily 

convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

2.17 

Inventories

 

Inventories except consumables are carried at the fair market value at the end of each reporting period, whereby 

the resulting unrealised gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. This is an alternative policy allowed by SFRS(I) 

1-2 Inventories for commodity broker or trader, as this better reflect the performance of the Group. The Group’s 

operating activities, including procurement of raw materials, selling of finished goods and entering into forward 

commodity (natural rubber) contracts are subject to movements in the market prices of natural rubber. The 

Group has two main types of sales contracts and purchase contracts; long term contracts (“LTCs”) and spot 

contracts (“Spot”). The prices for LTCs are usually determined based on the average market price for the delivery 

months, whereas the prices for Spot contracts are usually agreed on the day the Spot contracts are entered. In 

addition to the management of the price risk between the sales and purchase activities, which is the key driver 

and contributor to the Group’s profitability, the Group also provided other ancillary services such as processing 

and distribution. The profit for these ancillary services is recognised in the profit or loss only when these services 

are performed by the Group.

 

Consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted 

average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 

completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

2.18 

Borrowing costs

 

Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the 

acquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the 

activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing 

costs are incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended 

use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest 

and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

2.19 

Provisions

 

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 

event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 

obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.

 

Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 

If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 

the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 

discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When 

discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Leases (cont’d)

 

Accounting policy prior to 1 January 2019

 

As lessee

 

Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the 

leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the 

present value of the minimum lease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised. 

Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to 

achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to profit 

or loss. Contingent rents, if any, are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

 

Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease 

term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.

 

Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease 

term. The aggregate benefit of incentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expense 

over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

2.22 

Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations

 

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying 

amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale 

if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 

use. A component of the Group is classified as a ‘discontinued operation’ when the criteria to be classified as 

held-for-sale have been met or it has been disposed of and such a component represents a separate major line 

of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate 

major line of business or geographical area of operations.

 

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated or 

amortised.

2.23 

Revenue

 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for 

transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 

 

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring promised goods or 

services to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance 

obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount 

allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.

Sale	of	goods

 

 

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered to the customer and all criteria for 

acceptance have been satisfied. 

 

(b) 

Interest income

 

 

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

 

(c) 

Rental income

 

 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line 

basis over the lease terms. The aggregate costs of incentives provided to lessees are recognised as a 

reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

2.21 

Leases (cont’d)

 

Group	as	a	lessee	(cont’d)

 

(i) 

Right-of-use assets

 

 

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 

underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 

depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost 

of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and 

lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-

use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated 

useful lives of the assets.

 

 

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects 

the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

 

 

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.13.

 

(ii) 

Lease liabilities

 

 

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 

value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments 

(including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments 

that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The 

lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 

by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 

exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are 

recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event 

or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

 

 

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 

lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 

interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 

remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., 

changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease 

payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

 

(iii) 

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

 

 

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and 

equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date 

and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption 

to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases 

and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

Group as a lessor

 

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an 

asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 

lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature. Initial direct 

costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased 

asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised 

as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

Taxes (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Deferred tax (cont’d)

 

 

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate 

recognition at that date, would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and 

circumstances changed. The adjustment would either be treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it 

does not exceed goodwill) if it is incurred during the measurement period or in profit or loss. 

 

(c)	

Sales	tax

 

 

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

 

 

- 

Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the 

taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of 

the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and

 

 

- 

Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

 

 

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of 

other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position. 

2.25 

Share capital and share issuance expenses

 

Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly 

attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital. 

 

Fair valuation of shares are based on the prevailing market price as at the date of issuance.

2.26 

Perpetual securities

 

The perpetual capital securities do not have a maturity date and the Company is able to elect to defer or not 

making a distribution subject to the terms and conditions of the securities issue. Accordingly, the Company is 

not considered to have a contractual obligation to make principal repayments or distributions in respect of its 

perpetual capital securities issue and the perpetual capital securities are presented within equity. Distributions 

are treated as dividends which will be directly debited from equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of the 

perpetual capital securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue.

 

On the election of the Company to repay the perpetual securities, the perpetual securities will be reclassified as 

a financial liability under SFRS(I) 1-39. The financial liability is initially recognised at fair value and any difference 

between the carrying amount of the liability and the previously recognised equity instrument is recognised in 

equity.

 

No gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss on the reclassification.

2.27 

Contingencies

 

A contingent liability is:

 

(a) 

a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 

Group; or

 

(b) 

a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

 

 

(i) 

it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 

settle the obligation; or 

 

 

(ii) 

the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

 

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only 

by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 

Group.

2. 

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 

2.24 

Taxes

 

(a) 

Current income tax

 

 

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount 

expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to 

compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting 

period, in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

 

 

Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items 

recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management 

periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 

regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

 

(b) 

Deferred tax

 

 

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting 

period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 

purposes.

 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:

 

 

- 

Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or 

liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 

affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 

 

- 

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 

associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 

differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in 

the foreseeable future.

 

 

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused 

tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 

against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and 

unused tax losses can be utilised except:

 

 

- 

Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial 

recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 

time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 

 

- 

In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 

associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 

that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable 

profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

 

 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to 

the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of 

the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each 

reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit 

will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year 

when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 

enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.

 

 

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or 

loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other 

comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is 

adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.

3. 

Significant accounting judgements and estimates (cont’d) 

3.2 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

 

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of 

the reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 

available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 

developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the 

Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

 

(a) 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

 

 

Determining whether goodwill and process know-how is impaired requires an estimation of the value in 

use of the cash-generating-unit to which the goodwill and process know-how have been allocated. 

 

 

The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise, the 

growth rate used for extrapolation purposes and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present 

value. The key assumptions applied in the determination of the value in use including a sensitivity analysis 

are disclosed and further explained in Note 11 to the financial statements. The Group’s carrying amount 

of goodwill and process know-how at 31 December 2019 is US$296,379,000 (2018: US$297,399,000).

 

(b) 

Measurement of biological assets

 

 

The fair value of biological assets is estimated using the discounted cash flow model (“DCF”) by 

independent professional valuers. This requires an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the 

biological assets to be made and a suitable discount rate to be chosen, in order to calculate the present 

value of future cash flows. The valuation of these biological assets is particularly sensitive to discount 

rates as disclosed in Note 35(d)(i).

Contingencies (cont’d)

 

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except 

for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair 

values can be reliably determined. 

2.28 

Segment reporting

 

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their business units. 

Management regularly reviews the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess 

the segment performance. Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note 34, including the 

factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment information.

3. 

Significant accounting judgements and estimates

 

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, 

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and 

the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions 

and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or 

liability affected in the future periods.

3.1 

Judgements made in applying accounting policies

 

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, 

apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 

consolidated financial statements:

 

(a)	

Classification	of	rubber	trees	as	bearer	plants	or	non-bearer	plants

 

 

The Group has rubber plantations in Malaysia and Cameroon.

 

 

The classification of rubber trees as bearer plant or non-bearer plant depends on the business plan for 

respective rubber plantations, pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the trees, plantation and 

relevant market or industry considerations. Rubber trees are not considered bearer plant when there is 

commercially viable plan to sell the rubber tree as lumber to an established market. 

 

 

The Group has assessed that there is an established lumber market for rubber trees in Malaysia and 

Cameroon, and it is the Group’s business plan to sell the rubber trees as lumber at the end of the rubber 

production life.

 

 

The reclassification of Cameroon rubber plantation from bearer plant in the financial year ended  

31 December 2019 is due to the improvement in accessibility spurred by new transportation infrastructure 

near the Group’s Cameroonian plantations, which has rendered selling harvested rubber trees to key 

markets to be commercially viable. The change in circumstances led to the Group’s decision to construct 

a sawmill factory. As such, the classification has changed accordingly in December 2019. Fair value 

gain on biological assets of US$53,250,000 has been recognised on the date of the reclassification of 

Cameroon’s rubber plantation from bearer plant to non-bearer plant.

 

 

Further details are disclosed in Note 2.12.

 

(b) 

Impairment of goodwill and process know-how

 

 

Judgement has been made by the Group to identify the cash-generating units and assess the future 

market and economic assumptions, such as forecasted rubber price, forecasted sales volume, growth 

rate and pre-tax discount rates. The Group has estimated the recoverable amounts of cash-generating 

units to which goodwill and process know-how has been allocated to, based on value-in-use approach. 

Estimates used in deriving the value-in-use, are disclosed in Note 3.2(a).

Changes to CGU

 

With effect from 1 January 2018, the Group restructured the Group’s operation into 3 main business segments 

after carrying out review of its operations to streamline its operating structure. Similarly, the CGU to which 

goodwill and intangible assets have been allocated to, have been reallocated in 2018 to different CGUs, which are 

certain business units within each business segment.

11. 

Intangible assets (cont’d)

 

The calculations of value in use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

 

Growth	rates – The forecasted growth rates are based on published industry research and do not exceed the long 

term average growth rate for the industries relevant to the CGUs.

 

Pre-tax discount rates – Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each 

CGU, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been 

incorporated in the cash flow estimates. 

 

Rubber price – The forecasted rubber price is based on estimated rubber price published by one external industry 

report.

 

Gross	profit	per	metric	tonne	– forecasted gross profit is based on estimated gross profit for the future years.

 

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions

 

Changes to the assumptions used by management to determine the recoverable value, in particular the pre-

tax discount rate and growth rate, can have significant impact on the results of the assessment. Management 

believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying 

amount of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

 

For HRC Group, assuming that gross profit per metric tonne deviates from budget by 17%, there will be an 

impairment loss of US$2,900,000 to the goodwill.

Intangible assets (cont’d)

 

Customer related intangibles

 

Customer related intangibles relates to non-contractual customer relationships acquired through business 

combination. The intangible asset has a remaining amortisation period of 5 to 8 years (31 December 2018: 6 to  

9 years).

 

Computer software

 

Computer software has a remaining amortisation period of 3 years (2018: 4 years). 

 

Trademark

 

Trademark has a remaining amortisation period of 1 year (2018: 2 years). 

 

Impairment	testing	of	goodwill	and	process	know-how	with	indefinite	life

 

The above goodwill and process know-how was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2019. No impairment 

loss was recognised as at 31 December 2019 as the recoverable amounts of the respective CGU to which 

goodwill and process know-how have been allocated to were in excess of their respective carrying values. The 

recoverable amount of the CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations using five years 

cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by management and assumed a terminal growth rate 

thereafter.

12. 

Property, plant and equipment (cont’d)

12(b) Right-of-use assets

 

The Group has lease contracts for land, office, vehicles and other equipment used in its operations with 

predominantly fixed payments over the lease terms. Some of these leases have terms of renewal but no 

purchase options or escalation clauses. 

 

Leases of land and office generally have lease terms between 1 and 92 years, machinery and other equipment 

generally have lease terms between 1 and 5 years. Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and 

subleasing the leased assets. 

 

The Group also has certain leases of office and other equipment with lease terms of 12 months or less and 

leases of other equipment with low value. The Group applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ 

recognition exemption for these leases. The election of short-term lease and low-value-lease exemption is made 

on lease-by-lease basis.  

 

Set out below are the carrying amount of right-of-use assets recognised and the movements during the period:

In 2018, positive changes have been made to TBH’s business and operations leading to improvement 

in TBH’s financial performance. As part of the Group’s continuous assessment of its key business 

segments, it determined that TBH Group fits into the Group’s business strategy and initial plan to dispose/

discontinue the operations of TBH Group has changed significantly and an immediate sale is unlikely. As 

such, the Group decided to reclassify TBH Group from discontinued operations to continuing operations.  

 

 

Accordingly, the comparative figures in the consolidated income statement and consolidated cash flow 

statement for financial year ended 31 December 2018 have been re-presented to reflect TBH Group as 

continuing operations.

Perpetual securities

 

During the financial year ended 31 December 2017, the Company issued perpetual securities with principal 

amount of US$150,000,000 bearing distributions at rate of 4.5% per annum. An amount of US$148,690,000 net of 

issuance costs, was recognised in equity.

 

The perpetual securities bear distributions which are payable semi-annually. Subject to the relevant terms 

and conditions of the perpetual securities, the Company may elect to defer or not making distributions on the 

perpetual securities and is not subject to any limits as to the number of times a distribution can be deferred.

 

The perpetual securities is classified as equity and distributions are treated as dividends. This is due to 

the reason that the Company has no contractual obligations to repay its principal or to pay any distributions, 

which means the instrument does not meet the definition as a financial liability under SFRS(I)	1-32	Financial	

Instruments:	Disclosure	and	Presentation.

 

During the current financial year, the Board of Directors have approved to distribute payment amounting to 

US$3,375,000 (2018: US$6,750,000) to the holders of the securities.

 

On 26 April 2019, the Group has redeemed all the principal amount of the perpetual securities of 

US$150,000,000. 

29. 

Other reserves

 

a) 

Capital reserve

 

 

Capital reserves pertain to the excess of capital paid by a shareholder for the shares in the subsidiary 

over the capital received from the same shareholder for the swap of the shares in the Company.

 

 

Capital reserve also includes funds arising from the Group’s People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) 

subsidiaries which are required to transfer 10% of the net income to the reserve fund in accordance with 

PRC Articles of Association.  

 

b) 

Other reserves

 

 

Other reserves pertain to fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments, premium paid by 

non-controlling interests for interest in a subsidiary and redemption amount for put option issued to non-

controlling interest of a subsidiary. 

 

c) 

Foreign currency translation reserve

 

 

The foreign currency translation reserve represents exchange differences arising from the translation of 

the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from that of the 

Group’s presentation currency.

26. 

Retirement benefit obligations (cont’d)

(1,485)

(1,324)

 

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding other assumptions constant. 

Changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the retirement 

benefit obligations to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the retirement benefit 

obligations calculated with the Projected Unit Credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied 

as when calculating the retirement benefit obligations recognised within the statement of financial position.

 

Through its retirement benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of 

which are detailed as below:

 

Changes in bond yields

 

A decrease in government bond yield will increase plan liabilities.

 

Inflation	risk

 

The majority of the plan’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation which higher inflation will lead to higher 

liabilities.

 

The weighted average duration of the retirement benefits obligation is 18.1 years (2018: 18.5 years).

Financial risks and management (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont’d)

 

 

(ii) 

Interest rate risk

 

 

 

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the 

Company’s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The 

Group’s primary interest rate risk arises from its loan payables.

 

 

 

The Group’s exposures to interest rates are set out below.

 

 

 

Interest rate sensitivity

 

 

 

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates 

for non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change 

taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting 

period in the case of instruments that have floating rates. A 50 basis point increase or decrease 

is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 

management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

 

 

 

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held 

constant, the Group’s income for the financial year would decrease/increase by US$4,540,000 

(2018: decrease/increase by US$3,351,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure 

to interest rates on its balance due to the banks and financial institutions, and certain loan 

receivables.

 

 

(iii) 

Credit risk 

 

 

 

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting 

in financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy 

counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating 

the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its 

counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is 

spread amongst approved counterparties.

 

 

 

The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any 

Group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having 

similar characteristics if they are related entities. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative 

financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are creditworthy entities.

 

 

 

The maximum exposure to credit risk in the event that the counterparties fail to perform their 

obligations as at the end of the reporting period in relation to each class of recognised financial 

assets is the carrying amount of those assets as stated in the statement of financial position.

 

 

 

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there 

has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.

 

 

 

The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the counterparty fails 

to make contractual payments, within 90 days of when they fall due, which are derived based on 

the Group’s historical information.

32. 

Financial risks and management (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives

 

 

The Group and the Company is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of 

financial instruments. The key financial risks include foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, 

liquidity risk and commodity price risk. The Group has documented financial risk management policies. 

These policies set out the Group’s overall business strategies and its risk management philosophy. The 

Group’s overall financial risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the 

financial performance of the Group.

 

 

The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 

 

 

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it 

manages and measures the risk.

 

 

(i)	

Foreign	currency	risk

 

 

 

As disclosed in Note 2.7 of the financial statements, the functional currency of the Company is the 

United States Dollar.

 

 

 

The Group faces foreign exchange risk as its borrowings, export sales and the costs of certain 

purchases are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the 

Group entities, primarily Singapore Dollar, Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, Chinese 

Yuan Renminbi, CFA Franc and Thai Baht. The Group also holds cash and short-term deposits 

denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes. 

 

 

 

The Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure 

for some of its receivables. 

 

 

 

Foreign currency sensitivity

 

 

 

The following table details the sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the relevant foreign 

currencies against the functional currency of each Group entity. 5% is the sensitivity rate used 

when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 

management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The 

sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and 

adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity 

analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where they 

gave rise to an impact on the Group’s profit or loss and/or equity.

 

 

 

If the relevant foreign currency strengthens by 5% against the functional currency of each Group 

entity, income will increase/(decrease) by:

Credit risk concentration profile

 

 

 

The Group determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the country profile of its 

trade receivables on an on-going basis. The credit risk concentration profile of the Group’s trade 

receivables (net of impairment loss on receivables) at the statement of financial position date is as 

follows:

Further details of credit risks on trade receivables are disclosed in Note 18 to the financial 

statements.

 

 

(iv) 

Liquidity risk

 

 

 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial 

obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk 

arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities.

 

 

 

The Group maintains sufficient liquidity at all times by efficient cash and working capital 

management.

 

 

 

The Group’s ability to meet its obligations is managed by maintaining appropriate level of cash 

balance and working capital balances.

 

 

 

Non-derivative financial instruments

 

 

 

The following tables detail the remaining contractual maturity for non-derivative financial 

instruments.

 

 

 

The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based 

on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest 

and principal cash flows. The adjustment column represents the possible future interest cash 

outflow attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which are not included in 

the carrying amount of the financial asset or liabilities on the statement of financial position.

32. 

Financial risks and management (cont’d)

 

(b) 

Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont’d)

 

 

(iii) 

Credit risk (cont’d)

 

 

 

To assess whether there is significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a 

default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial 

recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information 

which includes the following indicators:

 

 

 

- 

Internal credit rating

 

 

 

- 

External credit rating

 

 

 

- 

Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic 

conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the borrower’s ability to meet 

its obligation

 

 

 

- 

Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower

 

 

 

- 

Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower

 

 

 

- 

Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality 

of third party guarantees or credit enhancements

 

 

 

- 

Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, including 

changes in the payment status of borrowers in the group and changes in the operating 

results of the borrower.

 

 

 

Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is 

more than 90 days past due in making contractual payment. 

 

 

 

The Group determined that its financial assets are credit-impaired when: 

 

 

 

- 

There is significant difficulty of the issuer or the borrower

 

 

 

- 

A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event

 

 

 

- 

It is becoming probably that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial 

reorganisation

 

 

 

- 

There is disappearance of an active market for the financial asset because of financial 

difficulty

 

 

 

The Group categorises a loan or receivable for potential write-off when a debtor fails to make 

contractual payments more than 365 days past due. Financial assets are written off when there 

is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in repayment plan 

with the Group. Where loans and receivables have been written off, the Group continues to engage 

enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these 

are recognised in profit or loss. 

 

 

 

The following are credit risk management practices and qualitative information about amount 

arising from expected credit losses for each class of financial assets. 

 

 

 

(i)  

Trade receivables 

 

 

 

 

The Group provides for expected credit losses (“ECL”) for all trade receivables using a 

provision matrix. The provision rates are determined based on the Group’s historical 

observed default rates analyse in accordance to days past due by grouping of customers 

which are:

 

 

 

 

- 

HRC Group 

 

 

 

 

- 

Corrie MacColl Group 

 

 

 

(ii)  

Other receivables

 

 

 

 

The Group provides for ECL for all financial assets based on general approach of 

12-months ECL either individual or collective basis. 

 

 

 

 

The Group has performed specific credit risk assessment on the loan to a third party.

Derivative financial instruments

 

 

 

The liquidity analysis for derivative financial instruments has been drawn up based on the 

undiscounted net cash inflows/(outflows) on the derivative instrument that settle on a net 

basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross 

settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been 

determined by reference to the projected interest rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at 

the end of the reporting period.

 

 

 

Please refer to Note 20 for more details.

 

 

(v) 

Commodity price risk

 

 

 

Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, the Group is exposed to changes in agricultural 

commodity prices. 

 

 

 

At the end of the reporting period, a 5% increase/decrease of the commodities price index, with 

all other variables held constant, would have increased/decreased profit before income tax by 

US$1,172,000 (2018: increased/decreased profit before income tax by US$151,000) and increased/

decreased equity by US$1,172,000 (2018: increased/decreased equity by US$151,000).

Fair value of assets and liabilities

 

(a) 

Fair value hierarchies

 

 

The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the 

valuation inputs used as follows:

Level 1 –

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group 

can access at the measurement date,

Level 2 –

Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 

liability, either directly or indirectly, and

Level 3 –

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 

(b) 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value 

 

 

The following table shows an analysis of each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value at the 

end of the reporting period:

Fair value of assets and liabilities (cont’d)

 

(c) 

Level 2 fair value measurements

 

 

The fair value of inventories (except consumables) are calculated using quoted prices in relevant 

commodity exchanges at the end of the reporting period, making adjustments according to the stage of 

production of the inventories, port of loading, and grades of products. Where such prices are not available, 

the Group uses valuation models to determine the fair values based on relevant factors, including 

trade price quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the commodities and commodity 

exchange price quotations and dealer quotations for similar commodities traded in different markets and 

geographical areas, existing at the end of the reporting period.

 

(d) 

Level 3 fair value measurements

 

 

(i)	

Information	about	significant	unobservable	inputs	used	in	Level	3	fair	value	measurements	

 

 

 

Biological assets

 

 

 

The fair value of the Group’s major biological assets has been determined based on valuations 

by an independent professional valuer using the discounted cash flow valuation approach. The 

most significant inputs into the discounted cash flow valuation approach are the average annual 

yield and discount rate. The fair value of biological assets is computed using average annual 

yield of 1.7 metric tonne per hectare (2018: 1.6 metric tonne), and discount rate of 11% (2018: 

11%) for oil palm and rubber trees in Malaysia plantation, average annual yield of 1.7 to 2.0 metric 

tonne per hectare (2018: Nil), and discount rate of 13% (2018: Nil) for rubber trees in Cameroonian 

plantations, average yield per tapping cycle of 7.42 metric tonne per hectare (2018: 7.42 metric 

tonne per hectare), and 0.02 metric tonne per hectare (2018: 0.01 metric tonne per hectare) for oil 

palm in Malaysia and rubber latex in Ivory Coast plantation respectively.

 

 

 

An increase in average annual yield per hectare will result in an increase to the fair value of 

biological assets, while an increase in discount rate will result in a decrease of estimated fair value. 

 

 

 

At the end of the reporting period, a 1% increase/decrease in average annual yield will increase/

decrease the fair value of biological asset by US$6,488,000 and a 0.5% increase/decrease in 

discount rate will decrease/increase the fair value of biological asset by US$19,577,000 for 

Cameroonian plantations.

 

 

 

Investment properties

 

 

 

The fair value of the Group’s investment properties have been derived using the sales comparison 

approach. Sales prices of comparable properties in close proximity are adjusted for differences in 

key attributes such as property location, accessibility, topography, facilities and utilities, size and 

date of transaction.

Capital management

 

The Group reviews its capital structure at least annually to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as 

a going concern, while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity 

balance.

 

The Group is required to comply with loan covenants imposed by the lenders, unless it is specifically waived by 

the lenders. This externally imposed requirement has been complied with by the Group in financial year ended 31 

December 2018 and 31 December 2019, with the exception of a loan in a subsidiary company for financial year 

ended 31 December 2019. As at 31 December 2019, the subsidiary obtained a waiver from the bank for a bank 

loan with carrying amount of US$97,540,000 for the non-fulfilment of financial covenants. The Company has 

obtained waiver from the bank to test certain financial covenants for a bank loan amounting to US$74,485,000 as 

at 31 December 2019.

 

The capital structure of the Group comprises only of issued capital and retained earnings. The Group manages 

its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 

adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to 

shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the 

years ended 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018.

 

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net borrowing divided by total equity. The Group 

includes within net borrowing, loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, adjusted for working capital items.

(iii) 

Valuation policies and procedures

 

 

 

It is the Group’s policy to engage external valuation experts to perform the valuation of biological 

assets and investment properties. The management is responsible for selecting and engaging 

valuation experts that possess the relevant credentials and knowledge on the subject of valuation, 

valuation methodologies, and SFRS(I) 13 fair value measurement guidance.

 

 

 

Management reviews the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and assumptions 

adopted, and the reliability of the inputs used in the valuations.

 

(e)	

Fair	value	of	financial	instruments	not	measured	at	fair	value	and	whose	carrying	amounts	are	reasonable	

approximation of fair value

 

 

The carrying amounts of cash and bank balances (Note 17), trade receivable (Note 18), loans and other 

receivables (Note 19), trade payables (Note 23), other payables (Note 24), and loan payables (Note 

25) approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial 

instruments or that they are floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near 

the statement of financial position date.
