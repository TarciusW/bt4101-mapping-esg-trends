Executive Chairman’s Message 

Dear Stakeholders,  

I am pleased to present the Sustainability Report of Imperium Crown Limited and its 

subsidiaries (the “Company” or collectively the “Group”) for the financial year ended 

30 June 2021 (“FY2021”), which provides information on the economic, environmental 

and social aspects of our sustainability business and practices. As we expand our 

footprint overseas, we have continually integrated sustainability practices into our 

business operations.  

Our hotel, tourist site and properties are operated in an environmentally and socially 

sustainable manner, and we comply strictly with local environmental and social 

regulations. 

In FY2021, COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact the tourism, travel and 

hospitality industries greatly and affected demand in our hospitality business. During 

these unsettling times, we stay committed to prioritising the safety of our guests and 

employees. Strict safety protocols remain in place and all hotel staff have been 

adequately trained to ensure that the hotel is well-prepared to ensure guest safety. 

As the crisis continues to rapidly evolve, we pledge to protect the health and welfare 

of our guests, employees and the surrounding community of our properties to the best 

of our abilities.  

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my gratitude to our clients, business 

partners and shareholders for their unwavering support. We look forward to your 

continual support as we strive to develop a more sustainable environment for all. 

Sun Bowen

Our Sustainability Story  

Our ESG Focus and Strategy 

Sustainable Tourism 

The Group is committed to achieving sustainable tourism which makes a low impact 

on the environment and local culture, while helping to generate future employment for 

the local community. We conducted impact assessments before the commencement 

of operations to ensure that operations are conducted in an environmentally and 

socially responsible manner. 

By achieving sustainable tourism, we maximise the positive contribution of tourism to 

biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction and the achievement of common goals 

towards sustainable development, including those related to poverty, inequality and 

environmental degradation. 

The Group is committed to operating sustainably in economic, environmental and 

social aspects. While the economic landscape for the leisure and hospitality industry 

in FY2021 was less than optimistic due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we believe that 

with our strategic business decisions and astute foresight, we will achieve sustainable 

returns for our stakeholders. The safety and welfare of our employees remain our top 

priority in these trying times. 

Sustainable Property Development 

The Group will work towards prioritising environmental sustainability in our property 

designs and construction. We comply strictly with environmental and socioeconomic 

laws and regulations.

Reporting Practice 

The Group’s FY2021 sustainability report has been produced in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards “Core” option covering our performance 

from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. This report covers the Hospitality and Property 

Development segments and our operations in the geographical regions of China and 

Malaysia. The GRI Standards were selected as it represents the global best practices 

for reporting on economic, environmental and social topics. The Company has 

engaged an external consultant, RSM Risk Advisory Pte Ltd, to advise in its 

preparation of this sustainability report. The following principles have been applied to 

determine relevant topics that define the report content and information quality: 

 

a) 

GRI principles for defining report content: Stakeholder Inclusiveness, 

Sustainability Context, Materiality and Completeness; and  

 

b) 

GRI principles for defining report quality: Accuracy, Balance, Clarity, 

Comparability, Reliability and Timeliness. 

 

The report incorporates the primary components of report content as set out by the 

SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements on sustainability reporting under Rule 711B 

and Practice Note 7F of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of the Catalist (the 

“Catalist Rules”) of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the “SGX-

ST”). 

GRI does not require external assurance and the Group has assessed that external 

assurance is not required as we are strengthening the sustainability reporting 

framework this year. However, internal controls are present to ensure the accuracy 

and completeness of disclosures in this report. 

This report supplements the Group’s Annual Report 2021 and is available online at:

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

 

Focus 1: Governance and Ethics 

Strong corporate governance has enabled the Group to navigate and manage key 

sustainability issues and ensure that the interests of all relevant stakeholders are 

considered when making business decisions. 

Corporate Governance 

We adhere to the “comply or explain” regime of the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance. Refer to the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report. We 

comply with the Catalist Rules as prescribed by SGX-ST. 

Governance and Statement of the Board  

The Group’s Board of Directors and senior management consider sustainability issues 

as part of our strategic formulation. To implement our sustainability efforts, a 

Sustainability Task Force comprising key management personnel and chaired by the 

Chief Financial Officer was established in January 2019 to oversee the sustainability 

performance of the Group as a whole. The Sustainability Task Force meets on an 

annual basis. 

The Board is responsible for and approves the material economic, environmental and 

social factors identified by the Sustainability Task Force, and ensures that the factors 

identified are managed and monitored.  

Please refer to the Corporate Governance Report in our Annual Report 2021 for more 

information on corporate governance practices, precautionary measures and risk 

management structure. 

Ethics and Integrity 

Anti-corruption  

GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3 

The Group takes a strong stand against corrupt practices and strategies, and this 

value has been communicated to all of our employees, major suppliers and business 

partners. The Company has formal policies on anti-corruption and our employees are 

educated on our anti-corruption stance upon induction and reinforced when necessary. 

Any forms of corruption within the Group will not be tolerated, and will be escalated to 

the Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

There was no reported incident of corruption in respect of FY2021.  

Whistleblowing 

The Company has established a whistle blowing policy where employees may, in 

confidence, raise concerns or observations about possible corporate malpractices and 

improprieties in financial reporting or other matters directly to the Lead Independent 

Director.  


13 

IMPERIUM CROWN LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

 

The Audit Committee (“AC”) has adopted a Whistle-Blowing Policy which provides 

well-defined and accessible channels in the Group through which employees may 

raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 

matters such as the encounter of any improper conduct within the Group. Procedures 

are in place for the proper follow-up and investigations of such whistle-blowing 

incidents, as and when they arise. The Group also extended the Whistle-Blowing 

Policy to members of the public as well by means of the Company’s website where 

the email addresses of the Chairman of the AC and another Independent Director are 

available for the raising of potential concerns under the Whistle-Blowing Policy. The 

objective for such arrangements is to ensure independent investigation of matters 

raised and to allow appropriate actions to be taken. 

The AC oversees the administration of the policy. Where a complaint has been made, 

a report will be submitted to the AC for investigation and follow-up. 

The AC did not receive any report during FY2021 and up to the date of this report.  

Risk Management 

The Group adopts a precautionary approach in strategic decision and day-to-day 

operations by implementing a comprehensive risk management framework. 

Environmental, Social and Governance risk identification and the ensuing mitigation 

strategy and approach are parts of our Group’s Enterprise Risk Management 

framework. 

Regulatory Compliance 

GRI 307-1, 419-1 

The Group strives to comply fully with all relevant social, economic and environmental 

laws and regulations. In FY2021, there were no instances of significant fines or non-

monetary sanctions incurred by the Group. In addition, no instances of any non-

compliance with environmental laws or regulations have been identified. 

Focus 2: Our Environment 

Promoting environmental sustainability is a core strategy for the Group. 

Environmentally responsible practices can help to preserve the cultural attractions and 

natural formations in the hotel’s surrounding areas, which will enhance the long-term 

viability of our tourism and hotel operations. 

Environmental Sustainability 

GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-5, 303-2, 303-3, 304-2, 305-2, 305-4, 305-5, 306-1, 306-2, 307-1

IMPERIUM CROWN LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

 

Leisure and hospitality 

The Group has identified cultural tourism as an area of growth in China. Under the 

auspices of the Shandong provincial government, tourism has been identified as a major 

sector for growth. “好客山东” (or “Hospitable Shandong”) is one of the highest accolade 

and branding that aptly describes Shandong province and it ranks highly among 

provinces in terms of tourist visitor-ship. Blessed with a richness of cultural heritage, the 

amalgamation of culture and tourism is a natural attraction to visitors within China and 

from overseas.  

The Wonder Stone Garden integrates wonder stones exhibition, garden tour, leisure and 

entertainment with folk culture. In an effort to preserve and celebrate the culture of this 

area, we implemented free entry for visitors to explore the theme park. The Hotel 

commenced operations on 17 September 2019. 

Given the nature and locality of the operations of the Hotel in WSP, we are aware that 

there will be certain environmental impact, such as energy and water wastage, waste 

generation and effluents discharge. As such, the Group is committed to preserving the 

surrounding biodiversity and minimising negative environmental impacts of our Hotel and 

tourism operations. We conduct in-house environmental impact assessments on an 

annual basis to identify the anticipated effects of our operations on the environment to 

mitigate the environmental risks of our operations through optimised management and 

operations.  

We have implemented sustainable practices and features at the Hotel, such as 

purchasing environmentally-friendly products and recycling hotel supplies wherever 

possible to reduce waste generation. Our Hotel uses solar energy to power its operations, 

thus reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions from non-renewable sources.  

The energy consumption and intensity for FY2021 are as follows (comparative figures for 

FY2020 have been included for illustrative purposes):

In addition, water is sourced from a licensed water supplier. No water is drawn directly 

from natural sources such rivers or lakes. This minimises environmental issues such as 

excessive groundwater extraction and water contamination. In FY2021, 14,580 m3 of 

water was consumed in hotel operations (FY2020: 15,000 m3).

IMPERIUM CROWN LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

 

The Hotel has its own wastewater treatment facility to ensure that wastewater is 

processed in accordance to regulatory requirements before discharge. A licensed 

waste collector is engaged to manage the disposal of waste. Furthermore, internal 

guidelines have been implemented to curb wastage and an incentive program is 

established to motivate waste reduction. The Hotel restaurant also takes into account 

the number of hotel guests and expected number of diners in the preparation of food 

to minimise food wastage. In FY2021, 240 kg of waste was generated during hotel 

operations (FY2020: 245kg). 

The Hotel construction and operations were in strict compliance with local 

environmental laws and regulations, and there was no reported incident of 

environmental non-compliance in FY2021.  

Property Development 

The Group is committed to being a responsible corporation in the communities we 

operate in, and we endeavour to deliver safe, efficient, environmentally sustainable 

and high-quality property developments. We strive to minimise our impact on the 

environment through conducting environmental impact assessments and achieving 

strict compliance with local economic, environmental and social regulations. Due to 

the current geographical location of the Group’s business, the Group has assessed its 

environmental impact based on standards specific to the People’s Republic of China. 

These standards include the Technical Guidelines for Environmental Impact 

Assessment - Atmospheric Environment (HJ2.2—2018) set by the National 

Environmental Protection Standard of the People’s Republic, as well as the 

Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002), the Standard for 

Groundwater Quality (GB/ T14848—2017) and the Environmental Quality Standard 

for Noise (GB3096—2008) set by the National Standard of the People's Republic. 

Supplier Management 

GRI 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2 

We select our Hotel operator, Inzone Hotels &amp; Resorts Group, based on their track record 

and environmental performance to ensure that our Hotel operations are aligned with the 

Group’s sustainability objectives and expectations. We also assess the environmental 

performance of our suppliers on an annual basis in an effort to establish a sustainable 

supply chain in our Hotel management. Suppliers are evaluated based on their energy 

and water conservation measures, as well as their waste management and recycling 

practices. Supplier evaluation are conducted on an annual basis to ensure that our 

contractors and Hotel operator operate in strict compliance with local social and 

economic laws and regulations.  

In FY2021, there was no reported incident of environmental and socioeconomic non-

compliance along our supply chain.

Focus 4: Our Community 

Social Responsibility  

GRI 202-1, 203-2, 403-2, 413-1, 416-2 

With the WSP being an upcoming tourist attraction, we envision to contribute to the 

booming tourism industry in the Shandong province and attract more tourists, thereby 

boosting the economy in the local community. We endeavour to preserve and promote 

the site safety, uniqueness and recognition of the WSP as well as the surrounding 

tourist spots. 

Additionally, we believe that the ease of people moving around is important. With the 

WSP situated within a five-minute drive from the city centre, bus terminal and major 

expressways, connectivity in the community is going to be enhanced with our 

presence and infrastructure, via the highways connected to major cities and the soon-

to-be completed Fei County High Speed Rail. 

In FY2021, the COVID-19 outbreak has continued to pose challenges to the leisure 

and hospitality industry. During these unsettling times, we stay committed to 

prioritising the safety of our guests and employees. We have implemented strict safety 

protocols and educated all hotel staff on the necessary measures to ensure that they 

are well-prepared in keeping the hotel and its guests safe. Our hotel operations were 

in strict compliance with local COVID-19 laws and regulations to ensure that we 

minimize the risk of transmission among the hotel guests, employees and surrounding 

community. 

We implemented adequate safety measures against COVID-19 at the hotel, such as 

measuring the temperature of all staff twice a day, conducting safety briefing, 

temperature taking and alcohol disinfection for all staff before entering the hotel, as 

well as disinfecting the hotel twice a day.  

In FY2021, there were zero incidents of COVID-19 transmission among hotel guests 

and zero among hotel employees which resulted in zero number of man-days lost. In 

addition, there was no reported incident of non-compliance with local COVID-19 laws 

and regulations regarding our hotel operations and services.

Furthermore, we are committed to economic and social development by hiring from 

the local community to improve social conditions and community development. We 

also procure from local suppliers wherever possible to support local businesses and 

the economy. In FY2021, we achieved 95% of local hires (FY2020: 63%) and 100% 

of our procurement vendors were local, and we will continue to engage with the local 

community in our business. The higher proportion of local hires may be attributed to 

the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a restriction of movement of people across 

provinces. Stakeholders should be minded that once there is no restriction of 

movement of people across provinces, the trend of such a high proportion of hires 

being local may not be sustainable in the long run. Nevertheless, the Company will 

continue to work to engage with the local community in its business. 

Other than increasing jobs and business opportunities available for the local 

community, we conduct social impact assessments of our operations and include 

assessment factors such as local employment and equal opportunities to ensure that 

negative social impacts on the local community are minimised. We will strive to 

minimise resource wastage by making responsible, sustainable purchase decisions.
