Sustainability Board Statement 

 

In view of the long lapse of time and the disruptions engendered by changes in the board composition and 

the management team, coupled with the adverse effect brought about by the Coronavirus disease 2019 

(“COVID-19” or “Pandemic”), the Management and the Board of Directors (‘Board”) have exercised 

significant and best judgements by taking a prudent and pragmatic approach in preparing this Report.   

 

We firmly believe that sustainability is integral to achieve long term commercial success. As we continue on 

our sustainability journey, we are committed to conduct our business in a responsible manner. We 

acknowledge our role in minimising the environmental and social impact from our operations. In line with 

our commitment to sustainability, the Board having considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation, determined the material ESG factors and economic performance (collectively as “Sustainability 

Factors”) and overseen their management.  

 

A sustainability policy (“SR Policy”) covering our reporting structure, materiality assessment and processes 

in identifying and monitoring material Sustainability Factors has been put in place and serves as a point of 

reference in the conduct of our sustainability reporting. Under this SR Policy, we will continue to monitor, 

review and update our material Sustainability Factors from time to time, taking into account the feedback 

that we receive from our engagement with our stakeholders, organisational and external developments.

5. 

Policy, Practice and Performance Reporting 

 

5.1 

 Reporting structure 

 

Sustainability is ingrained at various levels in our organisation. We have set up a committee responsible 

for overseeing our sustainability targets ("Committee"). This Committee is led by our Director, Sales and 

Marketing and consists of the key management executives as its members. They ensure the alignment of 

our business objectives with our sustainability targets and further hold the responsibility to communicate 

our sustainability progress to the Board.  

 

5.2 

Sustainability reporting processes  

 

Under our SR policy, our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant 

factors are then prioritised as material factors which are then validated. The end results of this process are 

a list of material Sustainability Factors disclosed in this Report. Inter-relations of which are as shown in the 

chart below:

5.3 

Materiality assessment 

 

The content of our Report has been shaped by the key material Sustainability Factors identified in our 

materiality assessment process. To determine our material factors, we undertook a process of identification, 

prioritisation, and validation with our senior management. 

 

We first conducted a thorough peer benchmarking exercise to list the Sustainability Factors reported by 

them in their sustainability reports. We further prioritised the key material Sustainability Factors by their 

importance to our stakeholders and the environment, social and governance impact created by our 

business. The selected Sustainability Factors were then endorsed by the senior management and the 

Board. 

 

5.4 

Performance tracking and reporting 

 

We track the progress of our material Sustainability Factors by identifying the relevant data points, 

monitoring and measuring them. In addition, we set performance targets that are aligned with our strategy 

to ensure that we remain focused in our path to sustainability. We shall consistently enhance our 

performance-monitoring processes and improve our data capturing systems.

6.1 

Economic performance  

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Measuring our economic and financial performance is important to evaluate our business and ensure we 

are on track to achieve our financial goals. We strive to continuously enhance our financial performance 

and create long-term value for our investors and stakeholders. 

 

Our approach to managing 

We will continue to preserve and intensify our efforts in optimising our business operations amidst this 

challenging time as well as coming up business plans and actions so as to turn around the business and 

create better shareholders’ value. 

 

More information on our financial performance is disclosed in our Annual Report 2020 available online.  

 

Target for FY2020 

Performance in FY2020 

Target for FY2021 

Improve or maintain our 

financial 

performance 

subject to market conditions. 

We recorded a lower loss before tax of 

S$5.5 million for FY2020 as compared to 

S$6.6 million in FY2019 mainly due to a 

decrease in administrative and other 

operating expenses and the Group’s 

investment 

in 

Camsing 

Healthcare 

(Fuzhou) Medical Instrument Co., Ltd 

had been fully impaired in FY2019. 

Improve 

or 

maintain 

our 

financial performance subject 

to market conditions. 

 

 

6.2  

Waste management 

 

We are committed to manage and minimise the impact of our retail 

operations on the environment through reducing waste generated 

from the sale of products.  

 

In an effort to reduce our environmental footprint, we offer 

customers non-woven reusable carrier bags at our retail stores for 

greater reusability and sustainability. During the Reporting Period, 

approximately 95% (FY2019: 93%) of carrier bags issued to 

customers are non-woven bags.

6.3 

Product quality  

 

Why is this a material issue? 

As a local healthcare retailer, which specialises in dietary supplements, we place our utmost priority on 

customer safety. Accordingly, we ensure that the products we sell are sourced from GMP certified 

manufacturing plants and comply with the local regulatory requirements. 

 

We review all our new suppliers and work closely with them to establish or bring in the products that can 

meet our quality requirements. Currently, most of our products are free of preservatives and artificial 

components to safeguard our consumer's health and safety.  

 

 

Our approach to managing 

As the health products come with a recommended shelf life, we adopt First-In and First-Out (“FIFO”) 

practice to minimise product write-off and wastage. 

 

While working with suppliers, we conduct regular vendor evaluation. We also follow-up with them for 

necessary changes to ensure better product management and workflow in the future. 

 

During the Reporting Period, there is no reported food safety incident due to the consumption of our 

products (FY2019: zero).

6.4 

Training and education 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We recognise that our employees are instrumental in the success and growth of our Group. We, therefore, 

invest in providing training and development opportunities to enable them to provide the highest quality 

service to our customers. We will continue to help our employees to be more competitive towards 

productivity and sales. 

 

 

As one of the leading providers of nutrition and health supplements, it is our responsibility to help our 

customers or potential customers receive proper as well as accurate information. We, therefore, train our 

employees on how to advise customers about their supplementary requirements according to their body 

needs. We aim to transform our sales staff into nutrition advisor. By helping them learn about the product 

content and origin, we want them to develop a deeper understanding of the products. Our goal is to 

complement the products we sell with advice from well-equipped and trained retail nutrition advisors. 

 

Our approach to managing 

We conduct in-house training of our products to all retail employees from frontlines to Area Managers. This 

training is conducted by our qualified Nutritionists. It aims to help new employees fully understand the 

purpose, usage and health benefits of our products. 

 

All our new employees are required to attend a three-day product skills and knowledge workshop. We have 

set a minimum standard of understanding that all employees need to achieve for completing the workshop. 

We also provide training to existing employees in the form of refresher courses once per month. This 

provides a good opportunity for discussion between Nutritionists and Area managers. When a new product 

is introduced, suppliers and Nutritionists join forces to conduct new products skills training to all retail 

employees.  

 


 

 

Camsing Healthcare Limited          Sustainability Report FY2020 

Page 8 

Our Nutritionists team also allocates time each morning to ensure new employees practice correct 

pronunciation of the products. They also conduct shops visits to check on the performance of our new 

employees. Performance feedback and review from Shop Manager or Area Manager are also key to 

monitoring our employee performance. 

 

The distribution of the average training hours per employee by gender and employment category are as

6.5 

Occupational health and safety  

 

Why is this a material issue? 

At Camsing Healthcare, the well-being and safety of our employees is one of our top concerns. We are 

committed to providing them with a safe and healthy work environment. Our management team consistently 

educates our employees about proper workplace safety procedures, practices, and behaviour to prevent 

any potential injuries and illness.  

 

Our approach to managing 

We ensure that all our employees across different operations are aware of the Workplace Safety and Health 

Act and we aim to provide continuous education for our employees on related matters. 

 

In our warehouses, the Warehouse Assistant Supervisor regularly conducts briefing about road safety, 

loading, and unloading safety procedures to our drivers. The Warehouse Assistant Supervisor also 

conducts sessions for our warehouse personnel regarding safety practices while handling, lifting, and 

transferring products. 

 

New employees are required to attend a one-week onboarding training conducted by the Shop Manager. 

The onboarding training includes a Safety and Health module. Once an employee is assigned to a particular 

shop, the respective Shop Manager conducts briefing on daily operations. Our Marketing and Operations 

Personnel, who frequently travel to the shops to support our sales team, are also aware of the safety 

measures to be adopted while working outside office premises. 

 

All employees are covered with insurance benefits such as Group Hospitalisation, Work Injury 

Compensation Act, Personal Accident and Personal Accident with Reimbursement. As part of management 

initiative, non-job related accidents are also covered under Personal Accident with Reimbursement, 

irrespective of the location of the incident. 

 

 

 

 

2 The above numbers are exclusive of office employees.

Health products are given to employees at almost no cost to help them improve their health and job 

performance. 

 

As part of company initiative, employees with zero sick leave receive a quarterly monetary incentive.

Equality and diversity in the workplace 

 

We value the diversity within our operations and are committed 

to provide a work environment for all employees that fosters 

fairness, equality and respect, irrespective of their gender, age 

or education background. We have a workforce of 65 (as at 31 

January 2019: 75) full-time employees as at 31 January 2020. 

 

On gender diversity, due to the nature of our industry, the 

workforce is predominantly female. As at 31 Jan 2020, the 

percentage of female to total full-time employees is 78% (as at 

January 2019: 69%). 

 

On age diversity, matured workers are valued for their 

experience, knowledge and skill. As at 31 January 2020, 62% 

(as at 31 January 2019: 53%) of our employees are at least 40 

years old. 

 

During the Reporting Period, we maintain zero (FY2019: zero) 

incident of unlawful discrimination against employees.
