OUR  

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

 



Dear Stakeholders,  

It is great pleasure to present our fourth 

Sustainability 

Report 

(“Report”) 

which 

demonstrates our sustainability efforts in a 

transparent and accountable manner.  

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board” 

or “Directors”) of MS Holdings Limited (“MS 

Holdings”, and together with its subsidiaries, 

the “Group”), this Report covers the Group’s 

strategies, 

policies, 

practices 

and 

performance 

in 

relation 

to 

economic, 

environmental, 

social 

and 

governance 

(“ESG”) issues.  

As a leading crane rental company in 

Singapore, we understand the importance of 

integrating sustainability in our supply chain 

and operations. Along with the evident 

effects 

of 

climate 

change, 

we 

are 

dedicated 

to 

contributing 

towards 

a 

sustainable future.  

As 

such, 

the 

Board 

has 

considered 

sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation, determined the material ESG 

factors and overseen the management and 

monitoring of these material ESG factors. 

This Report is for the financial year ended 30 

April 2021 (“FY2021”). It is set out on a ‘comply 

or explain’ basis in accordance with Rule 

711B and Practice Notice 7F of the SGX-ST 

Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist. 

In addition, it draws on the internationally 

recognized framework, the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting 

Standards

OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 

 

We have identified 12 indicators that matter most to our business, and to both internal 

and external stakeholders. These material issues are accounted for through the 

following five sustainability strategies.

The Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of 

corporate governance to achieve greater transparency 

and to protect the interests of its shareholders. 

We continuously communicate the need to uphold integrity 

and the Group’s firm stance against corruption, as well as 

the importance of maintaining highest level of conduct and 

ethical standards. 

We believe in the creation of long-term economic value 

and consistent economic performance for the Group. The 

Group generates revenue primarily from the leasing of 

cranes.  

In FY2021, the Group’s revenue decreased to S$9.8 million, 

as compared to S$14.0 million in FY2020. This was mainly due 

to the decrease in utilisation rates of cranes, which reflected 

the challenging market conditions faced by our customers 

in the construction industry. 

Our team comprises 84 employees as at 30 April 2021. The 

health &amp; safety of our employees is our priority and we ensure 

that our staff are well trained to operate equipment in work 

sites. Policies on health and safety are in place to protect all 

employees.  

In addition, since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic 

(“COVID-19”), we have stepped up our controls and 

implemented safe management measures at our workplace.

The Group supports global sustainability efforts in building a 

clean and green city for all to live, work and play in. 

We remain conscious of our energy and water footprints 

and look for ways to reduce them while balancing our 

needs.

MOVING FORWARD  

The Group’s utilisation rate of mobile cranes has been declining since April 2020 due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the Group expects 

the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to adversely affect the business.  

In the meantime, the Group will continue to focus on optimising cost and deployment 

of its fleet of mobile cranes and lorry cranes. The Group will also remain on the lookout 

for new business opportunities to grow its profitability. 

During this challenging time, the Group’s focus is on supporting our customers, our 

employees, and the local businesses in which we operate in. 

The Group will continue to monitor the economy, review, and explore cost savings 

measures. We will also continue to seek business opportunities and focus on optimising 

the deployment of cranes by submitting more tenders to public sector construction 

projects or mega projects. 

We will continue to work hard to tide through the challenging market conditions. We 

appreciate having all our stakeholders join us on this journey to creating a more 

sustainable future.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY  

 

These 5 pillars, as part of our sustainability strategy, guide us in creating sustainable 

value for all our stakeholders. They have been formalised by our Executive 

Sustainability Committee and approved by the Board. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 102-40 102-42 102-43 102-44 

Business decisions made by the Group consider the interests of our stakeholders who 

are or would be affected by our operations and decision-making processes. 

Our stakeholders include employees; suppliers; customers; regulators; investors; and 

shareholders whom we have identified considering the economic, environmental, 

and social impacts of our business, across the supply chain. 

Due to COVID-19, the frequency of physical engagements with stakeholders have 

been reduced. Instead, the Group transitioned to online platforms such as Zoom to 

engage stakeholders.  

 

APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We continually engage our stakeholders in the performance of our business through 

various channels. This engagement is important as we seek opportunities to manage 

our business in a sustainable manner.

REPORTING PRINCIPLES 102-46 

We applied the GRI reporting principles – Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability 

Context, Materiality, and Completeness – in defining the report content by 

considering the Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests 

of our stakeholders. 

 

MATERIALITY REVIEW PROCESS 102-46 102-47 

Performed in consultation with external consultants, the relevant topics and 

indicators that are covered in our Report were selected based on our review of the 

economic, environmental and social impacts which were most significant and based 

on our consideration of the topics that our stakeholders are most concerned with. 

The materiality assessment was subsequently endorsed by the Group’s Executive 

Sustainability Committee. 12 indicators from the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting 

Standards 2016, grouped into three main categories, were identified as relevant and 

material to the operations of MS Holdings.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ACTIONS TAKEN TO REDUCE 

CONSUMPTION 302-1 302-4 

The Group’s energy consumption is used to power our office building, yards and 

repairs workshops. In addition, we leased a worker’s dormitory to house our employees 

to comply with safe distancing measures imposed by the Government of Singapore. 

Our properties are located at Pandan Road and Gul Drive (Disposal completed on 30 April 2021) 

with a land area of 8,000 square meters and 4,900 square meters, respectively.  

 

OUR ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

In FY2021, the total energy consumption at all 

properties was 286,565 kWh compared to 320,062 kWh 

in FY2020. The decrease of 10% was due to continual 

energy 

savings 

measures 

adopted 

and 

the 

consolidation of operations at a single site in March 

2021 due to the planned sale of Gul Drive. 

 

OUR ENERGY SAVING INITIATIVES 

 Reminding our employees to save electricity by switching off 

electrical appliances when they are not in use. 

 Scheduling regular maintenance and servicing work for our 

air-conditioning systems to ensure that they are running 

efficiently.

ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES 102-41  

There were 84 permanent full-time employees as at 30 April 2021. There are no 

temporary part-time employees. Due to the nature of our industry and the need to 

operate heavy equipment, our organisation is male dominated. The demographics 

of our employees are presented below.

TRAINING 404-1 

In the mobile crane industry, it is necessary to continuously equip our employees with 

the knowledge and skills to perform work safely. This will minimise the risk of injuries and 

endangering the lives of themselves and their colleagues.  

The trainings attended by our crane operators and supervisors focus on safety 

procedures due to potential safety hazards in the work environment which they 

operate in.  

One of the key risks relates to the unauthorised and unsupervised operation of cranes. 

Operators and supervisors are required to be properly licensed to be allowed to 

operate the vehicle. 

The Group uses the Crane Despatch Monitoring System (“CDMS”) to track all required 

training programmes for all crane operators and workers. CDMS will send an 

automated email notification a month prior to the expiry of the employees’ license or 

course requirements.
