NGSC Limited 

Sustainability Report 2020 

 

Board’s Message 

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or the “Directors”) of NGSC Limited (“NGSC”, “we”, or 

the “Company” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to issue our 3rd 

Sustainability Report (the “Report”) in line with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) guidelines 

on Sustainability Reporting. We seek to provide stakeholders with a better understanding 

of our business and our approach to creating long-term value.  

 

As an investment holding company, the Group recognises the global concerns on climate 

change, economic volatility, concerns in business ethics and trust, growing social needs, 

and changing consumer expectations on the role of businesses. The Group noted that the 

operating environment would be challenging going forward, especially under the outbreak 

of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic this year. The Group has been 

working on increasing shareholders value and mitigating the impact on the business. 

 

The Group’s corporate values are professionalism, integrity, commitment, and conviction. 

We consider the well-being of our employees, the environment, and societies in which we 

operate to be integral to sustainable growth. 

 

The Board oversees the management and governance of sustainability and the selection of 

priority material factors. We are committed to maintaining good corporate governance, 

transparency, and accountability, and do so using a set of internal policies, structure, and 

processes, which include risk management, data protection, and anti-corruption policies. 

 

To enhance the content of this Report, we have improved our sustainability approach by 

conducting a materiality assessment and have expanded our sustainability disclosure by 

including more key performance indicators. The Group’s performance on the targets set in 

the previous sustainability report was monitored and the results are shown in the section 

headed “Sustainability Targets”. We also undertook a new approach for stakeholder 

engagement and materiality assessment, and the results are shown in the section headed 

“Identifying Material Sustainability Topics”.  

 

On behalf of the Board and Management of NGSC, we wish to thank all who have been with 

us throughout our sustainability journey so far. We look forward to your continued 

partnership and support.

Yours sincerely,

(“GRI”) Standards to allow a comparison of our performance over the years. We have 

chosen to adopt the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards as it is the most widely accepted 

global framework for voluntary corporate reporting of environmental and social 

performance. In articulating our approach, we have applied the GRI principles of accuracy, 

balance, clarity, comparability, reliability, and timeliness. This Report is also in line with 

SGX-ST’s ‘comply or explain’ requirements for sustainability reporting.

Scope of Reporting 

The Report focuses on the evaluation and measurement of the Group's business

monitoring of data and verification to ensure accuracy. We have not sought external 

assurance for this Report and we may consider doing so for future sustainability 

reports.

Company Information 

NGSC, headquartered in Singapore, is an investment holding company. Through its joint 

venture, the Group is engaged in the business of providing satellite-based services to a 

variety of industries including educational and financial institutions in the People’s Republic 

of China (“PRC”). 

 

The Company’s core business through its joint venture in the PRC include: (1) sale of 

satellite communications equipment and (2) provision of satellite-based communication 

services to enable telecommunication services in remote areas of the PRC. 

 

In FY2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic globally forced the Company’s joint 

venture to limit its business operations for a period of time. Strict measures were taken to 

contain the spread of COVID-19, including movement of transport vehicles, travel bans, 

social distancing and closure of non-essential services. This has taken a toll on the global 

economic prospects and resulted in an economic slowdown, which will have impact on the 

business and operations of the Group. As it is not possible to estimate the duration and 

consequences of the COVID-19 as well as its impact on the financial position and business 

of the Group, we will continue to closely monitor the economic environment in the future.

External Initiatives 

Due to the nature of business operations within NGSC, and that our corporate structure is 

lean as we are an investment holding company, external initiatives may not achieve the 

intended effect as our headcount is small. Notwithstanding that, NGSC is aware of the need 

to demonstrate our commitment to sustainability-related causes. In this regard, the 

Company will continue to explore any opportunities to participate in external initiatives.

We have a clear and effective governance structure in place that is supported by policies, 

standards, practices, and guidelines. Our corporate governance structure comprises 

Independent and Non-Independent Directors who oversee and monitor political, 

operational, and environmental trends and risks that could affect business activities. 

 

In order to have systematic management of the ESG issues, the Group has arranged 

designated personnel from various departments to handle ESG management as a working 

group. The working group is responsible for managing and monitoring our sustainability 

practices and the Board is updated on any material developments. Regular discussions are 

carried out on key issues in sustainability such as policies and measures implementation, 

stakeholder engagement, materiality topics, strategic planning, and goal setting. 

 

Our Sustainability Approach 

Stakeholders’ Engagement  

The Group values the opinions of its stakeholders and reviews the related ESG policies 

regularly. In order to address the key concerns from stakeholders, close communication is 

maintained to understand their feedback on ESG topics. We are continuously improving the 

adequacy and effectiveness of our risk assessment processes in response to the changing 

business and operating environments. Through regular stakeholder engagement, we 

identify and review material issues that are most relevant and significant to us and our 

stakeholders. We prioritise the sustainability issues that are material to the business and 

stakeholders.

Identifying Material Sustainability Topics 

The Group’s management and staff in major functions were involved in the preparation of 

this Report in order to assist the Group in reviewing its operations and identifying the 

relevant sustainability issues. We adopted a four-step materiality assessment process to 

assess the importance of matters relevant to our business and stakeholders. A survey had 

been conducted in accordance with the identified material topics to collect information 

from relevant departments of the Group. 

 

We recognise their concerns and undertook a comprehensive materiality assessment 

following leading practices outlined in the GRI. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate 

and review our material ESG topics with our stakeholders to ensure their relevance to the 

Group’s operation.

The Group has adopted a four-step materiality assessment process summarised below: 

 

In FY2020, 9 sustainability-related issues were identified and concerns of the stakeholders 

had been reviewed and discussed with the management and disclosed in the Report. The 

materiality matrix of the Group was as follows: 

 

 

 

Identification

A preliminary list of ESG matters were selected after discussion and 

analysis performed by the working group and the Board

Prioritisation

The identified ESG issues were ranked and prioritised based on the 

significance of impacts and degree of influence on our internal and 

external stakeholders

Validation

Material issues that were identified in Step 2 were presented to the 

Board for validation and approval

Review

Material issues that were approved by the Board will continue to be 

re-assessed in subsequent reporting periods to ensure that reported 

topics remain relevant and material

Sustainability Targets 

The Group’s management reviews and monitors our sustainability progress constantly. On 

top of that, sustainability-related targets are set and reviewed annually to achieve 

sustainable development. The table below summarises our sustainability performance in 

FY2020 and targets for FY2021:

Anti-Corruption 

The prevention of fraud, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism is of critical 

importance across all the markets. To demonstrate our zero tolerance towards acts of 

bribery, corruption, and fraud, we have implemented processes relating to Anti-Money 

Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and unilateral and domestic 

sanctions laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. As we are committed 

to conducting business following all applicable regulations and the highest ethical 

standards, this commitment is embodied in our Code of Conduct. We have communicated 

the relevant policies and procedures to all our employees. Any employee who contravenes 

the policies may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of 

employment. If the breach is significant, it may also lead to the prosecution of the parties 

involved. To ensure all employees are clear about the acceptable standards and procedures 

in business dealings, annual compliance training sessions are held for employees. 

 

Whistleblowing Policy  

A whistleblowing policy is also in place as a safe channel for employees to discourage 

practices and activities that are in violation of the work ethics and rules of the Group. 

Employees and any other parties are encouraged to report unlawful, unethical, or 

fraudulent activities or practices in strict confidence. All whistle-blowing reports are 

submitted to the Audit Committee Chairman and other Independent Directors of the 

Company. The identities of whistle-blowers are strictly kept in confidence to the extent 

possible to facilitate independent investigations for appropriate remedial and follow-up 

actions. We believe that this will not only encourage openness and promote transparency 

but also act as a form of check and balance against the internal controls and risk 

management practice. The Whistleblowing Policy was intended to act as an internal 

reporting structure that enables and encourages employees, and external parties, to raise 

concerns, in confidence, about possible irregularities within the Group. 

 

Conflict of Interest  

Employees are required at all times to declare conflicts of interests, whether it is direct or 

indirect, or whether it is actual or potential. All employees including the management team 

and the Board are required to make declarations of any existing or potential interest in 

companies and the nature of the interest on an annual basis, and update when appropriate 

voluntarily. The Code of Conduct is intended to communicate our values of integrity and 

respect for people to our employees, management and Directors, help them recognise and 

make informed decisions on ethical issues, assist in creating a culture of the highest ethical 

and business standards, and provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct. 

 


11 

 

Risk Management  

Risk management is considered as a strategic activity within NGSC. Our ability to manage 

risks creates opportunities as well. Corporate-level identification and management of risk 

are accomplished by using an Enterprise Risk Management approach. The Board of 

Directors is responsible for overseeing the overall risk management process. The Board has 

identified, reviewed, and updated the enterprise-risk assessment accordingly in FY2020. 

Committees of the Board and the Board as a whole participate in the oversight of the 

process. The Audit Committee ensures there is a risk management process, which is 

implemented accordingly. Responsibility for managing risk rests with executive 

management. 

 

Customer Privacy Protection 

Safeguarding our shareholders’ data is of paramount importance to the Group and we are 

committed to maintaining the utmost privacy and security of their personal data. We 

conduct our business in compliance with the requirements of the PDPA, which governs the 

collection, use, disclosure, and care of personal data. 

 

We have established data protection policies and procedures in compliance with the PDPA 

and have also appointed key management personnel who are responsible for the following:  

- 

Include aspects of compliance with the PDPA when developing and implementing 

policies and processes for handling personal data;  

- 

Disseminate data protection policies to all employees through shared drives and 

cultivate culture on compliance within the Group;  

- 

Manage personal data protection related queries and complaints from the Group’s 

stakeholders;  

- 

Alert management to any risks that might arise concerning personal data; and  

- 

Report any data protection matters to the Personal Data Protection Commission, 

where necessary.  

 

Our employees are also aware of keeping business-related information confidential. The 

Group has in place procedures limiting data access rights of our employees 

commensurating to their scope of work as a measure to manage data privacy risk. These 

include password authorisation by levels of responsibility for access to sensitive data. 

Access to data is granted on a need-to basis. In line with the PDPA requirements, we are in 

the process of formalising the process and appointing a third-party service provider for the 

proper disposal of physical documents. 

 

 


12 

 

In FY2020, there was no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of privacy and loss 

of customer data. Non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations related to customers’ 

privacy, including but not limited to the PDPA, was not identified. Moving forward, the 

Group targets to handle customer data responsibly in a secure operating environment as 

well as ensuring data are not being used for other purposes without adequate 

authorisation. 

 

Business Partners Management 

NGSC works with its subsidiaries in developing a sustainable relationship with business 

partners for its existing business model. As an investment holding company, we assess 

factors such as business partners’ and service providers’ core values, expertise, financial 

performance, and conformance to government regulations. The Company and its 

subsidiaries work closely to ensure our business partners and service providers have met 

requirements in regard to quality as well as environmental and social standards.  

 

We have standards and stringent procedures in place to identify, monitor, and manage risks 

and opportunities when selecting business partners and service providers. We review and 

evaluate all business partners and service providers prior to selection and regularly monitor 

and assess them during operation. Business partners and service providers are subjected to 

annual performance evaluations and may be suspended or removed from the approved list 

if they fail to fulfill our standards. The termination of relationship may also occur in the 

event any of them commits any substantial violation of related laws and regulations.  

 

Employment and Labour Practice 

Human Resource Management 

Employees are the foundation for supporting the development of NGSC. We are of the firm 

belief that all employees should be provided with a working environment that enables them 

to be productive and work to the best of their abilities. Hence, the Group has established 

relevant policies to fulfil its vision on people-oriented management. The human resources 

managing procedures are formally documented as an Employee Handbook, covering the 

aspects of recruitment, compensation, promotion, working hours and rest periods, diversity 

and equal opportunity, etc. The Employee Handbook does not only serve to standardise 

employment practices, it also respects and safeguards the legitimate interests of every 

employee, endeavouring to protect employees’ occupational health and safety. 

 

The Group understands that good benefits and welfare encourages retention and fosters a 

sense of belonging. We offer attractive remuneration packages, including discretionary 

bonuses, allowances, overtime, and medical claims. In addition to the entitlement of leaves 


13 

 

stipulated by relevant laws and regulations, the Group provides a variety of leaves to cater 

to the needs of its employees, including but not limited to emergency leave, marriage leave, 

compassionate leave, and parental leave. In FY2020, 1 employee had taken parental leave 

and had returned to work after the leave ended. 

 

Training and Education 

We believe in encouraging the development of our employees and grooming them to their 

fullest potential, personally and professionally. Hence, we are committed to learning and 

development programmes to drive productivity and develop the personal effectiveness of 

our employees. As part of the Company’s initiatives, our employees select and manage a 

curriculum that is aligned with their core role responsibilities and personal development 

interests. 

 

In FY2020, our employees have completed a total of 24 hours of training, including training 

on the International Financial Reporting Standards provided by the Institute of Singapore 

Chartered Accountants. 

 

In FY2020, 75% of our employees received an Annual Performance Review and had a 

performance rating in the system. Employees were encouraged to reflect on their 

performance over the financial year. During the employee appraisals, we recognise every 

employee for their valuable contributions at work, identify areas of improvement, and have 

set achievable targets for the next review period. 

 

Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Anti-discrimination  

The Group recognises the value of a diverse and skilled workforce and is dedicated to 

providing equal opportunities in all aspects of employment. Employees face no 

discrimination regardless of race, religion, colour, gender, physical or mental disability, age, 

place of origin, marital status, and sexual orientation and thus allowing them to be treated 

fairly in every aspect including recruitment, salary, training, and promotion. With the aim 

of ensuring fair and equal protection for all employees, the Group emphatically states its 

zero tolerance stance on discrimination in the workplace of any form.  

 

The Group strives to ensure that complaints, grievances, and concerns, including whistle-

blowing, are dealt with promptly and confidentially. Employees can raise concerns and 

report incidents without fear of reprisals. Anyone found to be engaging in any type of 

unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including 

termination of employment. 

 


14 

 

There were no incidents of discrimination during FY2020, and the Group aims to maintain 

this record for the forthcoming year. As at 31 March 2020, the Group had a total of 4 

employees (including one executive director), 2 of whom were male senior management 

personnel aged between 30 to 50, while another 2 were female general staff aged under 

30. 

 

Environmental Protection 

As an investment holding company which operates in an office setting, the environmental 

impact of business operation is minimal. Nevertheless, the Group is committed to building 

an environmentally friendly corporate image and strives to reduce our environmental 

impact including the consumption of electricity and paper by integrating various green 

practices into our daily operations. 

 

Building a Green Office 

The Group’s energy consumption is limited to the electricity used in our offices. We have 

implemented energy control policy and adopted various energy-saving measures, such as 

using energy-saving equipment and setting all printers, copiers, and computers to the 

energy-saving mode where possible. To raise the awareness of energy conservation, the 

Group encourages employees to establish energy-saving habits at the office, such as 

switching off lights and electronic appliances before leaving the office. 

 

In FY2020, the electricity consumption of the Group’s major operation, which is the office 

located in Singapore, was approximately 1,287 kWh. The intensity of electricity 

consumption was approximately 321.75 kWh per employee. For information on the Group’s 

workforce, please refer to the section headed “Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Anti-

discrimination”. 

 

Due to its business nature, the Group does not generate any hazardous wastes during 

operation. The major type of wastes generated by our operation is office paper, for which 

the Group has taken various measures to minimise the impact and promote the “paperless 

office” concept. In particular, we facilitate the use of electronic means for communication. 

We also encourage duplex printing and single-side printed papers reusing by setting up 

collection boxes near the printers. In addition, we encourage employees to reduce the use 

of one-off products and collect recyclable products, such as plastic and aluminum, to 

mitigate the disposal of general wastes. In FY2020, the Group’s office located in Singapore 

had disposed of approximately 31.19 kg of office paper.

Environmental Compliance 

During FY2020, no incident of non-compliance with relevant environmental laws and 

regulations was identified.
