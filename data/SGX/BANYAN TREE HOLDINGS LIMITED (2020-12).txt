Overview

Tourism has significant transformative power in the face of 

unprecedented global inequality and change. The pandemic 

has devastated livelihoods worldwide and now more than ever, 

strengthening our core value of sustainability is necessary to 

ensure resilience for business, people and the planet. 

Our efforts extend beyond the precautionary approach, 

integrating social and environmental responsibility throughout 

operations and travellers’ experience to serve the greater good, 

and create measureable impact towards the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals.

Who We Are

Banyan Tree Holdings is 

one of the world’s leading 

independent, multi-branded 

hospitality groups. The 

Group’s diversified portfolio of 

hotels, resorts, spas, galleries, 

golf and residences is centred 

on five award-winning brands 

(Banyan Tree, Angsana, Cassia, 

Dhawa and Laguna).

Established in 1994, Banyan 

Tree Group was founded with 

sustainability as a core value with a 

carefully crafted motto of “Embracing 

the Environment, Empowering 

People”. A balanced approach 

to business for the greater good 

creates an environment in which 

we can bring out the best in people, 

and create long-term value for all 

stakeholders and destinations across 

a network of properties, products 

and brands, through a purpose-

driven mission. 

The year 2020 was particularly 

challenging for travel and tourism, 

and Banyan Tree Group was not 

immune to its effects. Together with 

overall cash conservation measures 

and the implementation of flexible 

working strategies, the Group had  

to restructure significantly for 

business continuity given the extent 

and duration of the pandemic. See 

page 6 – “Impact Of The Global 

Pandemic” for a review of our 

pandemic-related efforts.

Detailed breakdowns of operations (pages 17 to 27), revenue and finance 

(pages 30 to 35 and pages 58 to 76) can be found in our Annual Report 

(investor.banyantree.com). Headquartered in Singapore, we have a global 

presence including ownership or management interest in:

Since our last report, reporting scope has changed due to the closure of Banyan  

Tree Seychelles and Dhawa Jinshanling (China), and opening of Banyan Tree Krabi

Penang (Malaysia).

In our 26 year-history, this global pandemic has 

been by far the worst crisis we have faced in its utter 

devastation of people’s livelihoods. The hospitality 

industry has been hit hard, yet now is the time to see 

the opportunity in this crisis, to choose to reimagine 

and build back better, to leave a legacy that balances 

profit with the greater good. 

Sustainability starts with a company’s value system and a 

principles-based approach to doing business. Our team’s  

safety and wellbeing always remain our first priority, and we  

are strengthening a culture of empathy and resilience. As we 

journey through these challenges, we do it with a collective  

and unchanging voice: the culture of our company remains 

authentic and connects with, and provides stewardship of, 

cultural and natural heritage. 

To not just survive, but thrive, we continue to go beyond 

the precautionary principle to create shared value with our 

stakeholders. This is a critical time to reassert our purpose, to 

ensure we bounce back with more resilience and sustainability 

in a post-pandemic world. We look to move from preservation 

to aspiration, and being resilient means constantly adapting 

towards a purpose that guides evolution. Purpose is the  

compass for business, and our original purpose of 

“Embracing the Environment, Empowering People” is more 

meaningful than ever. 

This is an opportunity as much as a crisis, and has the potential 

to bring out the best in people. The pandemic will pass and, as 

people and as a company, we will build back better.

After proudly celebrating our 25th Anniversary in 

2019, we faced an unprecedented challenge in 2020. 

Such a milestone often provides an opportunity for 

reflection, more so in light of the global pandemic, 

which serves as a platform to rethink how business 

interacts with society. 

No man or woman, no community, business, city or country  

is an island, isolated or independent of one another. No nation 

remains unscathed by the impact of the pandemic, and often 

it is those less fortunate in Least Developed Countries or at risk 

of societal exclusion that experience the greatest impacts. The 

interconnectedness of society means we not only share the 

consequences of the global pandemic, but we also collectively 

can engineer a positive future through impactful partnership.

Our ecosystem of greater good is centred on the belief that our 

business is a vehicle for societal betterment and transformation. 

In this time where hope and optimism are needed more than 

ever, we strive to catalyse positive ripple effects that extend our 

support to more partners seeking to create positive, sustainable 

change. To this end, we introduced our Greater Good Grants 

scheme in 2020, to provide funding for community and 

environment projects that contribute to the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals. 

We are not just on a journey of recovery, but a journey of 

discovery. COVID-19 has been a threshold for new norms, new 

ways of thinking and working to enhance knowledge and our 

understanding of people, cultures and the use of technology. 

This journey of discovery requires a growth mindset to learn 

while we also unlearn past practices that must be discarded to 

support a more sustainable and resilient future. 

There is much to look forward to in the near future. It is an 

exciting and exhilarating time for businesses to recover and 

discover, and to craft a better future, together, for all.

Serving The Greater Good

The pandemic has had unprecedented economic 

impact, with the travel and tourism sector particularly 

hard hit. Asian tourism was hardest hit in the first five 

months of 2020, with a 60% year-on-year reduction, 

while forecast global losses may reach US$2.2 trillion 

or 2.8% of global GDP*.

Sustainability encompasses people, planet, prosperity, peace  

and partnership. Economic sustainability is the foundation on 

which Banyan Tree Group creates shared value in culture, nature 

and livelihoods. Our Group was not immune to the impacts 

of the global pandemic. This summary of financial capital is 

provided for transparency as a core pillar of sustainability;  

a more detailed review can be found in the annual report 

(investor.banyantree.com). 

Our Group’s revenue includes Hotel Investments, Branded 

Residences and Extended Stay, and Fee-based business. As at 

31 December 2020, revenue from our Hotel Investments was 

contributed by Thailand (71%), Indian Ocean (27%) and Others 

(2%). Branded Residences and Extended Stay consist of sales of 

Hotel Residences and Laguna Residences and Extended Stay. Our 

Fee-based business comprises hotel, fund and club management, 

spa and gallery operations, design and other services.

We aim to quantify natural, human and social capital and the 

intangible assets of our global operations to support transparency 

and responsible travel by 2025. We began this process in 2020 

with a pilot impact assessment at Laguna Phuket.

The pandemic is an unprecedented global health, 

social and economic emergency, and the enormous 

toll on international tourism is apparent. No nation 

remains unaffected, but countries most dependent  

on tourism for jobs and economic growth are hardest 

hit, putting an estimated 100 to 120 million jobs at risk 

particularly in Least Developed Countries (LDCs)  

and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). 

Reductions in tourism have knock-on impacts to natural and 

cultural heritage. World Heritage sites remain mostly closed, 

intangible cultural heritage practices such as traditional festivals 

and gatherings were postponed, and reduced tourism has 

resulted in significant funding cuts for biodiversity conservation. 

The global pandemic has undone decades of progress on poverty 

and disease. This global crisis has highlighted the important role 

tourism can play in advancing the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs). 

Out of crisis comes opportunity: to rethink tourism, mitigate 

impacts on lives and economies, and rebuild a carbon neutral and 

resilient tourism with people at the centre. Banyan Tree Group’s 

response thus far includes the establishment of our SafeSanctuary 

programme, creation of a flexible employment programme to 

protect jobs, a rehiring app that also helps staff find new roles and 

access reskilling training, complimentary tele-therapy sessions 

with external practitioners to support associate wellbeing, and an 

internal learning revolution promoting resilience, self-awareness 

and self-care.

This report summarises the challenges and successes during  

this difficult period of our journey, as well as our future ambitions. 

The travel and tourism sector cannot be satisfied with simply 

doing least harm. Regenerative travel, whereby we leave a  

place better than how we found it, is necessary to replenish 

human and natural capital.

The material topics presented in this report were  

prioritised via a stakeholder-inclusive process to 

frame and focus our efforts, scale up positive impact, 

and reduce or avoid negative impacts, to support 

long-term sustainability and resilience. 

Seven topics were selected based on stakeholder importance: 

climate change, pollution and waste, biodiversity, employee 

satisfaction, leadership, ethical compliance and data privacy. 

We voluntarily report progress on staff development,  

culture and heritage, responsible travel and supply chain  

due to their importance to our core sustainability values. 

This report presents the scope and importance of each 

material topic, our management approach, commitments, 

responsibilities, targets and actions. Each material topic is aligned 

with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  

Further details on the alignment, selection, description and 

progress for each material topic can be found online†. 

The global pandemic has fundamentally changed society, with 

many unforeseen impacts. Consequently, our proposed revision 

of our material topic assessment shall be delayed until post-

pandemic to ensure we capture stakeholder sentiments, identify 

new priorities, set ambitious targets and establish processes for 

our journey to 2030 aligned with the SDGs.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY

Sustainability Approach

Over the past 20 years, tourism has been one of the 

fastest growing global industries and accountable for 

up to 80% of domestic GDP in many Least Developed 

Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States 

(SIDS). In addition to this economic value, tourism is 

inherently linked to natural and cultural heritage  

and wellbeing. 

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development makes a 

specific call to tourism to support delivery of the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly #8: decent 

work and economic growth, #12: responsible consumption 

and production, and #14: life below water. Sustainable tourism 

is defined as “tourism that takes full account of its current and 

future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing 

the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host 

communities” (World Tourism Organisation). In line with this 

definition, we believe tourism can, and should, do more to 

support all the SDGs, especially as guests in the countries  

where we operate. 

We have therefore aligned our efforts with the SDGs, to help 

better identify needs and support people, planet, peace, 

prosperity and partnership. Businesses must play a key role in  

the realisation of the United Nations SDGs, but impact 

measurement remains a challenge and must be guided by 

government. We shall look to further develop our stakeholder 

engagement so we may collectively create positive, measurable 

impact through partnership.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT†

ALIGNMENT WITH SDGs*

Serving stakeholders and embracing purpose is 

central to the way Banyan Tree Group functions in 

society. Partnership is essential to achieve the SDGs, 

built on trust that is developed through regular 

stakeholder engagement. Without stakeholders, a 

company cannot recover and thrive once more in a 

post-pandemic world.

We encourage regular, personal, two-way communication with 

stakeholders, including our associates, customers, investors, 

partners, suppliers and communities where we operate. This is 

achieved through informal and townhall style meetings, trainings 

and workshops, presentations, discussions and feedback forums 

with guests, and evangelisation of our sustainability philosophy 

through roundtable discussions within both the travel and 

tourism, and wider business communities. A cross-sector 

collaborative approach engages individuals, businesses, NGOs, 

and academic institutions worldwide to benefit environmental  

conservation and society.

In 2020, face-to-face meetings were difficult or impractical. A 

quarterly e-newsletter‡ was implemented to summarise key 

efforts towards our broader sustainability goals and objectives 

carried out at our properties around the globe. Earth Day was 

marked with the launch of Banyan Tree’s 25th anniversary 

commemorative book “Rooted in Sustainability”, which we  

hope provides a sustainability roadmap and inspiration for 

others. In the wake of COVID-19, we also joined EarthCheck’s 

Global Hygiene Taskforce to help the travel and tourism  

industry meet the needed health and hygiene challenges 

necessary for recovery.

Through partnership, business and communities create shared 

value that is more than the sum of their individual parts. Our 

future objectives centre on the concept that no single element of 

society can bring about long-term sustainable prosperity, but all 

must work together in cohesion to bring positive change. Now 

more than ever, it is important to move beyond communication 

to collaboration.

Sustainability Approach

Our

Environment

Travel and tourism operations are often intrinsically 

dependent on natural heritage, and Banyan Tree Group’s 

conservation journey started with its beginnings in 1984 

by “Embracing the Environment, Empowering People”.

Extending beyond the precautionary approach, Banyan 

Tree Group conserves resources through efficient 

operations, employing a science-based approach and 

partnership creation to conserve sensitive ecosystems 

and threatened species, and support climate action and 

the Sustainable Development Goals.

Our Greening Communities programme raises 

awareness of climate change and sequesters carbon 

by planting trees in local communities. Despite 

reduced operations, 14,576 trees were planted in 

2020, with 523,188 trees planted to-date, sequestering 

a maximum of 162,268 tonnes of carbon (based on 

40-kg of carbon sequestered per tree per year, and 

assuming 100% survival), with 20,350 mangroves 

planted in the last three years that contribute to 

blue carbon ecosystem services including shoreline 

protection, fish nursery habitat and local livelihoods.

In partnership with Nuoc Ngot Social Protection Centre in 

Vietnam, 12,750 paperbark trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) 

were planted to provide a new income source for the Centre. 

Melaleuca oil is said to protect against inflammation, and revenue 

from selling the leaves shall support the Centre’s operation cost 

and mission to help poor children and people with disabilities. 

Following the success of this project, a further 10,000 trees were 

planted by the community inside An Bang Village and Phuoc 

Hung Village to support livelihoods. 

As we look to better value carbon, green space and greening 

initiatives, we conducted a rapid tree census at Laguna Phuket  

as a first step to formalise a valuation methodology for the  

Group which we shall develop in 2021.

Climate Change

Climate change is forecast to increasingly impact 

destination quality and travel, and 2020 provided 

insight to the catastrophic impacts of disrupted travel 

to many dependent economies and livelihoods 

worldwide. Aligned with the World Travel and 

Tourism Council’s (2015)† call to connect with global 

climate action, we have integrated climate change 

needs throughout our operations and environmental, 

social and governance sustainability efforts. 

Peak global carbon emissions fell by 17% in 2020 due to 

lockdowns that significantly reduced transport and industry 

(WMO, 2020*). While this provided some respite from the  

long-term global warming trend, the pandemic is not the solution 

to climate change, but it may provide a platform for sustained 

and ambitious climate action to reduce emissions to net-zero. 

Restricted traveller movements and temporary operational 

closures decreased our total resource use and waste  

production (pages 15 to 16) but also reduced the impact of  

our environmental and engagement initiatives (pages 18 to 20). 

The experience of 2020 has highlighted the need to establish 

science-based reduction targets for resource use, and better 

understand our carbon footprint to develop a roadmap for a net-

zero carbon goal.

EARTH HOUR

Each year we give a voice to climate change 

awareness by joining the global Earth Hour 

movement and turning off all non-essential lights  

for one hour at our properties worldwide. 

Lockdowns and operational closures reduced engagement and 

impact in 2020, but 21 properties were able to participate and 

saved over 3,500 kWh of electricity in a single hour: equivalent to 

9 months’ worth of energy to power a four-room public housing 

unit in Singapore (ema.gov.sg). Prior to temporary closure, our 

Maldives properties extended this initiative to each full  

moon, saving an additional 344 kWh.













Resource Use And Waste

Responsible consumption and disposal of resources 

reduces climate change impacts, and supports 

healthy environments and communities. Banyan Tree 

Group reduces consumption rates through improved 

efficiency, adoption of new practices and technology, 

and awareness programmes to encourage behavioural 

change and best practice. The principles of reduce, 

reuse and recycle have been implemented at  

all properties.  

Our KPIs are to implement at least one resource conservation 

initiative per property each year, and a 5% annual reduction 

for energy, emissions, water and waste. Reporting and tracking 

of individual resource conservation initiatives were revised in 

2020 to better track resource and financial savings over project 

lifetimes to support the adoption of best practice.  

Rigorous benchmarking, certification and assurance of energy, 

emissions, water use and waste production are conducted via a 

strategic partnership with EarthCheck* since 2010. Data for the 

2020 calendar year were collected onsite and validated remotely 

by EarthCheck due to travel restrictions preventing on-site audits. 

Energy and water use from properties not registered with 

EarthCheck were verified by financial documentation, but waste 

data could not be verified and are not included. Calculations 

of percent water and waste recycled for the Group were made 

on absolute values rather than averaging across properties, and 

values may vary from previous reports. Data presented may 

exhibit minor variance from previous reports due to auditing 

verification, and this year’s report retroactively includes 2019 

data for three non-EarthCheck properties: Angsana Bangalore, 

Angsana and Dhawa Cayo Santa Maria (Cuba). 

 

Total resource use is reported as the sum of all hotels, resorts, 

offices and golf courses. Resource intensity for hotels and resorts 

is presented per occupied room (POR) to allow comparison 

at different occupancies. Reduced occupancies due to travel 

restrictions in 2020 increased resource intensity because 

baseloads for public areas and operations typically comprise a 

large proportion of resource use. Consequently, comparisons 

normally made with regional industry averages and best practice 

are not valid or insightful for 2020 data and thus are not reported.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS

WATER AND WASTE

Total energy use and corresponding Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse 

gas emissions (GHG) decreased by 39% and 38% respectively due 

to reduced operations in 2020. Energy use reduced to 1,193,888 

GJ, with 51% purchased electricity, 44% stationary fuel and 5% 

mobile fuel, and GHG emissions reduced to 102,155 tonnes. 

Intensity of use and production (POR) increased by 6% and 34% 

respectively, largely due to baseloads and a 52% reduction in 

occupied rooms. 

Sixty-four energy conservation initiatives saved 29.9 million  

kWh and 1.9 million cubic metres of gas, worth US$1.7 million 

in 2020. LED replacement initiatives contributed to over 

US$380,000 in savings. 

Total annual potable water use reduced by 34% to 4.286 billion 

litres, a reduction of 2.3 billion litres from 2019, while use POR 

increased by 29%. Sixteen water conservation initiatives saved  

51 million litres of water.

 

Total waste reduced by 45% to 8,483 cubic metres and 

production POR increased by 16% to 16.1 litres for EarthCheck 

registered properties and business units. Potentially hazardous 

waste associated with the pandemic such as face masks were 

disposed according to local health regulations. No other 

hazardous waste was produced by operations.

Food choices affect our health and collective 

future, with food carbon footprints across the value 

chain making up over one-quarter of the world’s 

greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable food use is 

more than just what you eat, but where it is sourced 

and how it is produced.

Our plan to implement food waste tracking at our properties in 

2020 was postponed due to temporary COVID-related property 

closures preventing accurate baseline measurement. Our long-

term goals are to reduce food waste by 30% and divert 50% from 

landfill by 2025, with a 50% reduction and 100% diversion by 

2030. We shall also set our sustainable seafood targets in 2021 

as part of our ongoing commitment to food provenance and a 

sustainable supply chain (see page 33).  

 

Reducing meat consumption and diverting food from landfill 

can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, 

15 properties implemented Meat Free days and 13 properties 

operated organic gardens and farms to raise awareness of 

healthy diets and reduce emissions. This approach was further 

supported with the opening of ORI9IN, our first gourmet organic 

farm in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and a partnership with Grassroots 

Pantry to develop healthy, plant-based menus and sustainable 

kitchen practices. A joint venture with chef-turned-sustainable-

farmer James Noble of The Boutique Farmers, the agro-tourism 

partnership of ORI9IN focuses on import substitution and 

reducing carbon footprint without sacrificing flavour.

 

Food composting in Vietnam produced 360 tonnes of fertiliser 

(equivalent value of US$103,304), while Laguna Phuket joined 

Banyan Tree Bangkok in donating 1.1 tonnes of food (4,433 

servings) via Scholars of Sustenance (scholarsofsustenance.org). 

To-date, this partnership has diverted 3 tonnes of food from 

landfill to provide 12,274 servings and save 4 tonnes of  

CO2 emissions.

FOOD AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing threats 

to the environment and global wellbeing. Single-use 

plastics take a few seconds to produce, a few minutes 

to use, but hundreds of years to break down. 

Since our pledge to reduce single-use plastic on Earth Day 2018, 

we have tracked 31 categories of plastic for reduction. Compared 

to a 2017 baseline, we have reduced single-use plastic by 54%, 

with 9 million less pieces of plastic used in 2020, and 19.6 

million pieces of plastic prevented from going to landfill or the 

environment since 2018. Over 2,100 km of cling film has been 

reduced, almost the equivalent distance from Singapore  

to Manila. 

 

Our efforts have reduced to eliminate, and where suitable 

alternatives are yet to be found, replaced with compostable or 

biodegradable alternatives. Of the  three target items  

we prioritised, we have reduced 2.5 million straws (99.7% 

reduction), 1.8 million bottles (41.6%) and 1.7 million bags 

(53.0%). Bintan added a water bottling plant in 2020, eliminating 

over 400,000 plastic bottles annually. The top-ten performing 

properties have reduced single-use plastic by more than 80%, 

with four properties achieving reductions over 90% in 2020. 

While some of the reductions in 2020 may be attributed 

to reduced use due to temporary closures, some items use 

increased due to COVID-associated health measures. The overall 

trend is of continuing reduction, despite a net increase of three 

properties since 2017 (5 openings and 2 closures). 

We support our reduction efforts with collaborative community 

clean-ups (see page 20) to remediate and cleanse natural 

systems, and educate to support a shift from a single-use 

disposable society.

Like any resource, we must monitor the 

environment in order to detect change 

and direct conservation or restoration 

efforts. Banyan Tree Group applies a 

strategic and science-based approach 

to conservation to engage and educate 

travellers, communities and our associates 

to develop stewardship. Our adaptive 

conservation framework addresses  

key global issues, critical habitats  

and priority species†. 

 

Dedicated conservation centres support 

education, restoration and research 

programmes in the Maldives and 

Indonesia. Partnerships with local  

and international NGOs and researchers 

support on-the-ground conservation 

efforts, with generated data reported  

to stakeholders to support local or  

regional management. 

Travellers can play an important role in 

long-term monitoring and conservation 

as citizen scientists, reporting sightings 

through our especially curated 

programmes. Sightings of marine 

megafauna in the Maldives and bird 

populations in Bintan support assessments 

of ecosystem health and climate change. 

Annual coral reef monitoring at 18 sites 

in the Maldives and six sites in Bintan 

completed their sixth and eighth years 

respectively, with reports published online 

and shared with local managers. These 

scientific assessments inform and direct 

conservation and restoration projects, and 

quantify recovery from the 2016 global 

coral bleaching event. 

Turtle conservation programmes at  

six properties focused on generating 

awareness among travellers, local 

communities and fishermen, nest 

protection and hatchling releases in 

partnership with local organisations  

and research centres in Indonesia,  

Mexico and Thailand. 

 

Long-term monitoring of shark 

populations, established to assess the 

efficacy of a national fishing ban in the 

Maldives, completed its sixth year in 

partnership with Newcastle University 

and the local government. An additional 

7,000 minutes of underwater footage 

were added to a growing database of 

41,540 minutes collected to-date.

Biodiversity And The Environment







Twenty-two of our properties in 10 countries are in, or adjacent to, areas of protected status or high biodiversity*, 

and consequently we must act as stewards to safeguard and promote a healthy, resilient and sustainable 

environment. Our Stay for Good programme invites guests to connect and engage actively and passively with 

natural heritage to increase awareness, promote engagement and long-term stewardship.

Our

Community

Creating shared value with the community whether they are 

employees, customers, communities or business partners 

embodies our commitment to social responsibility. 

Internally our approach promotes wellbeing, diversity,  

satisfaction, health and safety, as well as professional development 

to increase productivity and improve employee and customer 

satisfaction and loyalty. 

Externally we employ a stakeholder engaged approach to identify 

areas of aligned interest to promote responsible travel and work 

towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

Associate Satisfaction And Wellbeing     

Banyan Tree Group is committed to the happiness, 

health, safety and wellbeing of our family of 

associates. We advocate a balanced, sustained and 

dynamic approach to wellbeing that acknowledges 

the dynamic and interconnected world in which we 

live, where everyone aspires and desires to live well. 

In 2020, due to the global pandemic and cessation of many 

operations, a wellbeing survey was completed by 6,467 associates 

(83%) for the first time in lieu of the annual associate satisfaction 

survey. The survey posed 64 questions, equally divided between 

eight pillars of wellbeing. 

Survey results reveal the degree of awareness, frequency of 

practice and sustained state of wellness, which respondents can 

discuss with our Wellbeing Practitioners to explore solutions 

aligned with individual interests and needs. This wellbeing survey 

shall be conducted annually, with the associate satisfaction survey 

to resume biannually in 2021, with a KPI of 100% completion and 

85% satisfaction. 

We implemented our SafeSanctuary programme in June to support 

the health and wellbeing of associates and guests during the global 

pandemic. The health and safety of our associates is supported 

by a structured and coherent approach to Enterprise Risk 

Management. On-site inspections provide independent unbiased 

assessments and recommendations, with key concerns addressed 

on a quarterly basis by the Audit &amp; Risk Committee (ARC). 

Annual training to associates in fire awareness (KPI: 100% associate 

attendance) and CPR (KPI: 30% of associates at each property) was 

reduced due to temporary closures. Workplace incidents and lost 

workdays declined, with no workplace mortalities. Nine associates 

tested positive for COVID-19, all of whom were quarantined and 

recovered to good health.

Associate Development     













banyantreeglobalfoundation.com/associate-development

Education and professional growth is a key 

component of Banyan Tree Group’s social 

responsibility commitment, supporting sustainable 

development and pathways out of poverty. 

Developing and nurturing our associates ensures 

a consistent and effective approach to personnel 

sourcing and retention, and is reinforced by a 

promotion strategy to positions of responsibility. 

Biannual performance reviews identify development needs, 

which are addressed through individual and group learning 

opportunities and our management academy, with our goal  

of five hours of training per associate per month. 

*  2019 is the first year in which this value is tracked



Established in 2008, Banyan Tree Management 

Academy (BTMA) serves as a centralised training 

facility that supports organisational goals  

by advancing people development and  

management excellence. 

Although interruptions to business prevented the achievement 

of our KPI of 5 hours of training per month per associate, the 

global pandemic presented new opportunities. Online trainings 

became the primary platform for learning, with 56 sessions led  

by BTMA developing a greater number of associates than 

previous years.

Banyan Tree Gallery conserves the  

culture and heritage of destinations  

while sustaining artisans’ livelihoods 

and skills through gainful employment. 

Partnership selections are based on 

three stringent categories: conservation, 

community and cause of work. The large 

increase in commissioned products was 

due to bulk purchasing of turndown 

gifts and corporate gifting, such as a 

collaboration with Autistic Thai Social 

Enterprise Company Ltd. to commission 

artwork used in the production of tote 

bags for UCB bank.

Empowering Education

















Education combats poverty and betters livelihoods. A context-based 

approach identifies local needs and opportunities, resulting in a 

semi-structured but diverse contribution to supporting sustainable 

communities through inclusive and quality education. Our efforts 

support education through vocational training and internships,  

as well as educational support in the community.





SEEDLINGS MENTORSHIP

INTERNSHIPS

SEEDLINGS CAFÉ

Our Seedlings programmes nurture 

young people at risk of societal exclusion, 

providing vocational and life skills, and 

creating a lasting positive community 

impact. Mentorship and scholarships are 

provided to young people aged 12 to 18. 

Structured topics guide mentor-mentee 

interactions to reinforce social (heritage, 

culture, arts and crafts), environmental 

(conservation), academic (language and 

computing), and health values (nutrition 

and lifestyle). 

Some programmes were put on hold 

in 2020 due to lockdowns, reducing 

the mentorship provided. We have 

developed new guidance for our 

programme based on best practice 

accumulated, and are exploring new 

Seedlings social enterprise opportunities, 

as well as mentorship training in 2021. 

Internships provide valuable learning 

experiences to develop future hospitality 

professionals. Predominantly as part of 

tertiary education requirements, 1,083 

vocational internships were supported 

with a combined equivalent of 405 years 

of training in 2020. 

Leveraging Banyan Tree Group’s Food and Beverage expertise, training includes an 

internship within hotel outlets, with graduates working at a Seedlings Café before 

permanent job placement at local outlets. Our Seedlings café was temporarily closed  

in 2020 due to the pandemic.

taken care to avoid a knee-jerk reaction 

whereby our efforts may be misplaced 

and lack impact. Support was provided to 

the Government of the Maldives through 

the donation of a nucleic-acid extractor 

to support national COVID-19 testing. 

There are many hidden issues associated 

with COVID-19, such as mental health,

waste production and disposal, domestic 

violence against women in lockdowns, 

and access to education. We shall identify 

partnership and opportunities where our 

efforts will be most impactful.

Our

Responsibility

As a socially responsible business, Banyan Tree Group was founded with the 

core value of driving sustainable development. Tourism relies on peace, but it 

also has transformative power to promote positive change. 

Our commitment to sustainable development and responsible travel is 

founded on prudent, ethical and accountable governance, with internal 

and external engagement and participation, external benchmarking and 

certification, and transparent reporting since 2006. We support sustainable 

development and responsible travel by inspiring associates, guests and 

partners to take a long-term view when making business decisions.

Data privacy and protection are key business 

challenges and the responsibility of the whole 

organisation. Our holistic management approach 

to legal compliance and operational management 

fosters a culture of awareness to respect and ensure 

the privacy of our stakeholders. Data privacy policies 

ensure compliance with the Personal Data Protection 

Act 2012 in Singapore, and the European Union’s 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

Internal IT Risk Management and Audit teams review best 

practices and enforce company security policies to identify gaps 

and support IT Policy governance. Audits target the control of 

digital data access and mitigate risks of such access, ensuring 

rapid implementation of critical security patches and firewall 

updates. An annual external audit of technology and digital 

assets is conducted by an international cybersecurity consulting 

firm, to assess risk and response. Insurance coverage is in place 

to protect against cybersecurity risks, and cloud data sits with 

industry leading players and leverages their security structure.

Associate awareness and engagement with data security occurs 

through policies and regular information sharing on prevailing 

risks and recommended actions. Internal phishing campaigns 

were implemented in 2020 to evaluate awareness and identify 

individuals in need of targeted refresher and additional training. 

Group-wide cybersecurity training for IT personnel and access 

point users was delivered to 5,259 associates (68%). In 2020,  

no substantiated complaints, breaches or losses of customer  

data were identified. 

Data Privacy

Resilience in the face of global disturbances such 

as the ongoing pandemic requires proactive and 

adaptive leadership that incorporates a pragmatic  

and holistic approach while connecting on a  

personal level. Purpose is the compass to resilience, 

and we see a return to personal and organisational 

purpose, which is fundamental in shaping the  

shared reality of work during, and emerging from,  

the global pandemic. 

From crisis comes opportunity, and we have embarked on 

an organisational culture shift that marries personal and 

organisational purpose. This is the job of leadership, not 

management; it is not top-down instruction, but bottom-up 

facilitation. Engaging our associates from the onset allows us to 

build a bridge to organisational purpose. We believe that during 

this time of stress, aspirational leadership is key. 

As a publicly traded company, our Board of Directors and 

Management teams are committed to maintaining the 

highest standards of corporate governance based on the 

recommendations of the Code of Corporate Governance. 

A breakdown of the Board of Directors can be found in the 

Annual Report (see pages 47-51). The Board of Directors 

consider sustainability issues as part of the company’s strategic 

formulation, and approved the selection and monitoring of 

the material ESG factors addressed in this report. 

Our group sustainability committee meets quarterly, 

with leadership from the Banyan Tree Global Foundation 

(banyantreeglobalfoundation.com). Each property has a 

designated sustainability representative and ‘green team’ that 

meet monthly. We inaugurated regional sustainability leaders to 

support our properties in 2020, and shall create functional group 

sustainability committees (e.g. engineering, housekeeping etc.) 

for a more process and purpose-driven approach in 2021.

Banyan Tree Group continually seeks to  

enhance corporate transparency and stakeholder 

accountability to create value with integrity. Business 

is conducted in accordance with the highest level of 

ethics and law compliance, following international 

and local anti-corruption, anti-bribery and labour 

laws, rules and regulations in countries we operate.  

We expect the same standards from those with whom 

we do business (See Supply Chain, page 33).

As a founding member and signatory of the United Nations 

Global Compact in Singapore†, we are committed to upholding 

the Ten Universal Principles on human rights, labour, the 

environment and anti-corruption. We support the United 

Nations World Tourism Organisation Global Code of Ethics 

to support sustainable development, safeguard cultural and 

natural heritage, integrate local employment, and support 

worker’s rights. Compliance to Banyan Tree Group’s sustainability 

standards is assessed annually with an online or onsite audit of 

environmental, social, operational and governance systems and 

initiatives in partnership with EarthCheck‡.  

In 2020, we had zero incidents of corruption or bribery, and  

no business partnerships were terminated or not renewed due  

to corruption. 

Our Code of Conduct strengthens associates’ awareness of 

good corporate conduct, governs conflicts of interest, and 

freedom from sexual harassment, and is supported by group-

wide awareness training delivered to 1,607 associates in 2020 

(17%). All associates are required to sign the Code of Conduct 

annually, with 95% completion in 2020. We promote diversity 

and inclusiveness, hire without discrimination and recognise 

freedom of association. Our confidential whistle-blower policy 

affords freedom to report violations without retaliation.

And Corruption

A diverse work environment can boost profitability, 

productivity, creativity, inclusivity, innovation and 

more. However, diversity and inclusion are not just 

a business imperative, they are a moral one. These 

two interconnected concepts: the make-up of our 

Group and how we value and integrate the presence 

and differing views, perspectives, cultures and 

experiences, are of fundamental importance  

to our culture, particularly during a period of  

post-pandemic change. 

There is no one-size-fits-all approach. To Banyan Tree Group, 

diversity and inclusion in the workplace are not about quotas 

and are more than policies, programmes or headcounts. 

We make differences matter and respect uniqueness to build 

trust and commitment and a more innovative and creative place 

to work. Rather than forcing people to fit within a culture, we 

focus on helping them thrive. 

Within this report we share our diversity (Who We Are: page 2), 

how we create a safe and welcoming environment and recruit 

without bias (Wellbeing: page 22, Ethical Compliance: page 32), 

and how we create a sense of belonging and purpose through 

empathetic leadership and bottom-up engagement (Leadership: 

page 31). In 2020 we conducted a pilot Gender Pay Gap 

assessment of Phuket, which we aim to upscale across the Group 

and disclose annually in this report.

A sustainable supply chain is an opportunity to make 

responsible choices that drive respect for human 

rights and the environment. Supply chain disruptions 

experienced in 2020 due to restricted movement 

and transportation due to the pandemic, provide a 

catalyst to review what, where and how we source.

Our supply chain consists of input providers (infrastructure,  

water and energy, equipment, food and beverages), service 

delivery (accommodation, catering and attractions), and travel. 

We endeavour to create partnership, evangelise our commitment 

to sustainability, champion local and sustainable procurement, 

and actively seek and favour business relationships with those 

who share our values. 

The supplier Code of Conduct was implemented through the 

Global Foundation website in 2020 for the first time, with a KPI 

of 80% dollar purchases from Tier 1 suppliers completing self-

assessments. By 2025, we target 100% annual completion,  

with evaluation of poor supplier performance or non-conformity 

supported with remediation action. 

Of 4,928 suppliers reported in 2020, 2,334 completed codes of 

conduct covering $39.8 million worth of purchases (69%). Data 

were not available for seven hotels (Juizhaigou, China; Seoul, 

Korea; Balaclava, Mauritius; Riads, Morocco; Hacienda, Mexico; 

Dhawa and Angsana in Cuba), and the lower than targeted 

completion was largely due to pandemic-related disruptions. 

Banyan Tree Spa works with local communities and responsibly-

sourced indigenous products to connect with a local sense of 

place. All products are 100% vegan and cruelty-free, with no 

sulfates, parabens, synthetic colouring, unsustainable palm oil or 

mineral oils. 

Shortened supply chains post-COVID can support resilience for 

both business and local communities against future disruption. 

Increased local procurement will also connect travellers to a 

destination through food and culture, and provide opportunities 

to promote sustainable practices and responsible production 

that will benefit livelihoods and climate change through reduced 

carbon footprints. In 2021, we shall map our supply chain and 

openly disclose our supplier lists to promote transparency and 

drive supply chain sustainability.

GREEN IMPERATIVE FUND 

BANYAN TREE GLOBAL FOUNDATION 

GREATER GOOD GRANTS

RESORT AUTONOMOUS FUND

Our sustainable financing mechanism implemented in 2001 

supports worthy environmental action and community-based 

projects where Banyan Tree Group has a presence. 

Guests are invited to support under an “opt-out” arrangement 

with a small contribution of US$2 per room night at Banyan Tree 

branded properties, or US$1 per room night at Angsana, Cassia 

and Dhawa properties. Donations are dollar-matched by the 

receiving property. 

Established in 2009, Banyan Tree Global Foundation directs 

and guides the Group’s continual pursuit of responsible and 

sustainable business, and allocates donations to worthy projects, 

under its Singapore-based Board of Directors: Ms Claire 

Chiang, Mr Eddy See and Mr Dharmali Kusumadi, managed by 

Coordinating Director Dr Steve Newman. 

Contributions and disbursements are accounted for under  

Banyan Tree Global Foundation Limited, a company 

incorporated in 2009 as part of the ongoing effort to formalise 

Banyan Tree Group’s sustainability efforts and structure. The 

entity is audited by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, Singapore. 

In 2020, to build on our commitment to sustainable 

development, we created an external call for project funding 

for the first time, to support projects aligned with one or more 

of our six focal areas (health, education and culture; climate 

change, biodiversity and innovation) within a local context 

in countries where we operate. This is aimed at supporting 

measureable impact and progress towards larger regional or 

global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals 

to help people and the planet.

It is our ambition to increase support to grassroots and  

on-the-ground NGOs and worthy projects that create impact  

and progress towards the SDGs, at a time when people and  

the planet are most in need. If the first round of projects are  

successful, this shall be the first of many such annual calls to  

create partnership necessary to meaningfully contribute to  

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Each resort is allocated an annual budget of 20% of their  

previous year’s GIF mechanism contribution. The fund is  

allocated at the discretion of the property’s sustainability  

champion and General Manager, following local stakeholder 

consultation to identify impactful projects that create shared  

social and environmental value with the primary beneficiary 

external to Banyan Tree Group. 

Project administration is limited to a maximum of 20% 

expenditure, and funds cannot be spent on gifts for guests,  

service charge for associates, or wages. Funds may be used  

for research and development, as long as the results of such 

research are shared unreservedly and publicly.

OUR COMMUNITY

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

WASTE REDUCTION:

Building on the 3Rs and our single-use 

plastic elimination efforts, our next 

primary goal is the measurement and 

reduction of food waste footprints. 

Accurate baseline measurement will 

depend on business levels, but teams 

shall be trained and implemented to 

support this key effort to reduce waste 

and climate change impact. We aim  

to support this by piloting food  

digestion and promoting food  

diversion from landfill.

CLIMATE CHANGE:

The pandemic has highlighted the 

need to establish Science-Based Targets 

to reduce resource use and better 

understand our carbon footprint. We 

shall work with EarthCheck to develop 

context-based targets, review Science-

Based Target setting, and quantify our 

carbon footprint to evaluate feasibility of 

a net-zero carbon ambition.

PARTNERSHIP: 

Through our Greater Good Grants 

scheme, we will implement new external 

projects through the Banyan Tree 

Global Foundation that will develop the 

partnership necessary to meaningfully 

contribute towards the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development.

 

COMMUNICATION: 

Effective communication is necessary to 

educate and inspire both internal and 

external stakeholders, and to facilitate 

bottom-up engagement. We will support 

our best practice blueprints with greater 

sustainability programme development 

and handbooks.

A NEW STRATEGY:  

Due to many unforeseen impacts 

of COVID-19, we feel it is necessary 

to conduct a new material analysis 

a year ahead of schedule to identify 

new priorities for our journey towards 

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development. This will result in the 

creation of new sustainability strategies, 

ambitious targets, and processes to 

track impact and ensure transparent 

accountability.

SUSTAINABLE SOURCING:  

Our supply chain remains a priority and 

we will shall not only aim to increase 

supplier engagement and awareness,  

but also map and assess supplier 

risk in detail. We shall support with 

recommended supplier lists and 

responsible  procurement guidance, 

to shorten supply chains through local 

sustainable procurement. 

The ongoing global pandemic in 2020 meant that our goals and needs shifted, and fundamental shifts and 

considerations of how we do business were needed. Some of our goals remain unfulfilled from 2020 due  

to more pressing needs, while new opportunities presented themselves that we have incorporated into our 

group sustainability strategy. The year 2021 shall be an important year where we look to emerge from the 

pandemic, stronger than ever.
