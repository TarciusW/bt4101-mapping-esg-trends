Board Statement  

The Board is pleased to present our third Sustainability Report (the “Report”) for Khong Guan Limited 

(“KGL”) and its subsidiaries, and associates (the “Group”), for the financial year ended 31 July 2020 

(“FY2020”).  

 

This Report is set out on a "comply or explain” basis in accordance with Rule 711B and Practice Note 7.6 

of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual on Continuing Listing 

Obligations. This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (“GRI”) 

guidelines, at "Core” option. Corresponding to GRI’s emphasis on materiality, the Report highlights the 

key environmental, social and governance related initiatives carried out by the Group from 1 August 

2019 to 31 July 2020. 

In defining our reporting contents, we have applied the GRI principles by considering the Group’s 

activities and its impact as well as expectations and interests of our stakeholders. We observe the 

following four principles: materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability index and completeness. 

For reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity 

and reliability. The Environment, Sustainability and Governance (“ESG”) data and information provided 

have not been verified by an independent third party.  The data has been obtained from reports 

generated from our internal accounting systems and we have relied on internal data monitoring and 

verification to ensure accuracy. 

 

During this period of great uncertainty amidst the Coronavirus pandemic, the Board, has in its review of 

operations, concluded that Occupational Health and Safety of our employees is key in ensuring the 

continued growth and sustainability of our operations. 

 

As we continue on our sustainability journey, the Board is committed to further incorporating 

sustainability initiatives into our business decisions, assuring our stakeholders of our commitment in 

conducting our business in a transparent and sustainable way. 

 

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as this will enable 

us to improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments and suggestions to

Sustainability Governance 

At KGL we believe strong governance is the key to a sustainable business. Throughout FY2020, we 

continue to comply with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) Code of Corporate Governance. Please refer to 

the Financial Statements as set out in our Annual Report for FY2020 for further details. 

 

As part of our Group’s commitment, our products and services continue to meet all the requirements of 

our customers and the regulatory bodies of the countries we operate in. We work towards having all our 

products meet all the environmental and safety standards that are expected of us. 

 

The Group has procedures in place to enforce good labour practices in all our operations. We also 

continue to provide training opportunities for continuous employee development. The results are a loyal 

workforce, many of whom have been with us for decades, as well as the quality and delivery of products 

and services. We strongly believe that in the long run, good labour practices will have a positive impact 

on our economic performance.  We value our relationships with our clients and the wider community in 

which we operate.  These relationships have benefited us in the past and will continue to aid us while 

we operate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Corporate Profile 

The Group, which comprises KGL and its subsidiaries, together with the Group’s associate, possesses a 

thriving trading,  distribution and manufacturing businesses in Malaysia dealing in Fast-Moving 

Consumer goods (“FMCG”) products and food ingredients. These are operated through holdings in our 

subsidiaries Tong Guan Food Products Sdn Bhd (“TGF”) and Swee Hin Chan Company Sdn Bhd (“SHC”). In 

addition, our 30% equity held associate, United Malayan Flour (1996) Sdn Bhd (“UMF”) is a diversified 

group mainly dealing in the production and sale of wheat flour, oatmeal, pulses, cooking oils and cereals  

 

This Report focuses on KGL’s subsidiaries SHC and TGF as well as our associate, UMF; and in turn, UMF’s 

subsidiary, Federal Oats Mills Sdn Bhd (“FOM”).  Together, these business units contribute to the 

majority of our economic activities and/or financial results.  Please refer to the group chart below 

showing the relationships of the subsidiaries and its associate.

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2020   -   5 

The Group has a diversified portfolio of products and exports to over 30 countries worldwide. 

 

Our subsidiary, SHC, is an established and renowned importer and distributor of high-quality flour and 

starches. Steeped in tradition yet enterprising, SHC has built a proven track record of delivering high-

quality flour and starch products with value pricing and reliable services. 

 

Our wheat flour and starch products are halal certified by Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malalysia (“JAKIM”). 

JAKIM is the agency responsible for the Islamic affairs including halal certification of products required 

by Shariah laws in Malaysia. Today, SHC’s starch business is one of the market leaders in Malaysia. 

 

Our subsidiary, TGF, was incorporated in March 1973, and commenced business as an importer and 

distributor of flour and biscuits. It was entrusted with the responsibility of marketing our wide range of 

products in the state of Sabah. 

 

Today, TGF has grown into a full-fledged trading house that markets and distributes consumer products, 

such as foodstuffs and household products, from a variety of renowned brands, throughout the entire 

state of Sabah.  A large sales force supports TGF’s branch offices in all major towns of Sabah, servicing 

more than 3,000 retail outlets. This dedicated sales force ensures that our branches are able to operate 

smoothly and effectively. 

 

TGF has been importing and distributing products from renowned brands for over 40 years in Sabah, 

from cities to small towns and villages through outlets such as supermarkets, mini-markets, retail shops, 

hotels, modern food and beverage outlets, coffee shops and roadside stalls. Our market reach has 

helped our principal partners’ brands to reach many corners of Sabah. 

 

Our associate, UMF, through its majority owned subsidiary, FOM, continues to generate growth from its 

key consumers who are more health conscious.  FOM’s Oats products are seen as an economical choice 

for consumers.  As such, our Oats products are now exported to consumers around the Asia Pacific 

region and parts of the world. 

 

The Group will continue to focus on product safety and compliance with local laws and regulations to 

bring our consumers quality products and services.  We have also long focused on developing our 

human resources to ensure sustainable economic performance. Today, these values serve us well as we 

proudly present our Report.

Markets Served  

The Group, through its subsidiaries, is involved in the trading and distribution businesses in Malaysia. 

These subsidiaries supply FMCG and food ingredients. The Group’s 30% associate, UMF, is a diversified 

group dealing in the manufacture and sale of wheat flour, oatmeal, pulses, cooking oils and cereals and 

other investments. The UMF group currently exports to over 30 countries in Asia, the Middle East, and 

Africa. 

 

In Singapore, the Group continues to supply good quality wheat flour from UMF’s wheat flour mill in 

Penang, Malaysia, to local food manufacturers and bakeries. 

 

Supply Chain  

The Group’s main manufacturing footprint is made through its 30% associate, UMF, which has a wheat 

grain processing operation.  UMF works with selected, reliable grain merchants with a track record of 

providing quality and reliable supply of grains in order to provide our customers, whether consumers or 

food manufacturers, with quality products.

Types of Customers 

Products manufactured by UMF and other products distributed by the Group serve both households as 

well as food manufacturers including but not limited to bakeries, confectionaries, noodle manufacturers 

and wholesalers. 

 

UMF, through its subsidiary, FOM, continues to grow its Oats business under the “CAPTAIN OATS” brand 

as we observe more consumers are recognizing health benefits of consuming Oats as a part of their 

dietary requirements.  On January 2020, FOM commenced operations at its newly commissioned and 

modern manufacturing facility in Butterworth, Malaysia.

Approach to Sustainability 

The Group carries out an annual thought exercise with the senior staff and external stakeholders at KGL, 

TGF and SHC to determine what were values each entity found to be important, “visualized” these 

values and then mapped them against new sustainability targets that we would establish on a going 

forward basis.   

 

Material Assessment was determined by the following steps : 

 

1) Identification of the list of ESG matters that are relevant to the operations of the Group. 

2) Prioritization of the ESG matters identified by representatives from the subsidiary and associate 

companies. 

3) Validation of the material matters identified by the subsidiary and associate companies, and 

presented to the Board for validation. 

4) Review of the Material matters approved by the Board will continue to be reassessed in the 

successive reporting in order to ensure that these matters remain relevant and material to our 

operations. 

 

For FY2020, we have deemed the material matters identified in our previous reporting as still being 

relevant to the organization today.  We have identified Occupational Health and Safety as a key material 

factor today in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

endeavors. We view stakeholder engagement as a continual process. We engage with our stakeholders 

in a variety of formal and informal settings from the annual general meeting to ongoing dialogue with

Material Assessment 

 

Economic 

Market Presence 

SHC operates a network of distributors and manufacturers for starches, wheat flour and food products 

in Malaysia. 

 

The key strength of TGF is the strength of our market reach through an extensive distribution network 

across all major towns in Sabah. We supply and deliver a wide range of basic food products such as 

flour, cooking oil, dairy products.  The wide range of products we distribute enable our customers to 

enjoy the ease of having a single supply source for the majority of their food products. Building on this 

strength, TGF continues to expand upon the range of products we carry. 

 

While UMF serves a wide clientele base from small-medium enterprises to large-scale multinational 

manufacturers through an extensive distribution network that spans the Peninsular and East Malaysia, 

as well as Singapore and Thailand. While its subsidiary FOM supplies quality Oat products to consumers 

around the region and various parts of the world. 

 

 

Environmental 

 

Energy and Water 

Being a stakeholder in the environment in which we operate in, the Group will continue to monitor 

electricity and water usage to ensure these do not vary greatly from the previous year. We will continue 

to look for opportunities to increase energy efficiency and reduce water usage by educating our 

employees on how they can contribute positively to the environment at work as well as at home. 

 

 

Lists of Memberships in Business Associations 

The Group’s companies are members of a number of associations of which most Singaporean and 

Malaysian businesses in the same sector are members too. These include business federations and food 

manufacturer’s associations. In Singapore, these are the Singapore Business Federation (“SBF”), Food 

Manufacturers Association (“FMA”) and Singapore Bakery &amp; Confectionery Trade Association (“SBCTA”).  

In Malaysia, they are the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (“FMM”), and Malaysian Employers 

Federation (“MEF”). Through participation in these associations, we endeavour to contribute to the 

overall quality standards for products and services in the industry, where applicable, and ethics, 

sustainability of resources and other initiatives. 

 

 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2020   -   12 

Transportation 

The Group has a network of carefully selected outsourced transport partners for goods delivery which 

has been proven to enable it to optimize resources and minimize delivery costs.  

 

Social 

Labour Practices and Decent Work 

The Group does not condone and does not tolerate corruption or child labour in any form. All 

subsidiaries, including TGF and SHC are expected to adhere to these same policies and we expect the 

same from all our business partners. Our associate, UMF, also adopts similar policies. 

 

The Group provides maternity leave for female staff in accordance with local labour laws. In Singapore, 

KGL provides 12 weeks of paid maternity leave for non-Singapore nationals, and 16 weeks for Singapore 

nationals.  In Malaysia, SHC and TGF provide 60 days paid maternity leave for all eligible female staff.

TGF has seen an increase in new hiring in FY2020, largely in line with the approximately 10% increase in 

its revenue compared to the preceding year as it continues to expand its portfolio by taking on new 

FMCG products to add to and retain the existing portfolio that it carries.  

 

Currently, the composition of our workforce from both TGF and SHC, as well as our associate UMF, in 

aggregate, is made up of approximately 75% male and 25% female.  

 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2020   -   13 

Employee retention is of key importance to KGL and its subsidiaries and associate, as our employees 

have and continue to make significant contributions to the Group. We believe that our employees are 

largely happy with the prospect of life-long employment at the Group, where we continue to strive 

towards the ideals of a “family friendly” working environment.   

 

 

Training and Education 

The Group has internal processes to ensure operational risks are minimized and that all potential 

hazards are identified and precautions are taken. 

 

Our Group companies have formal management meetings at least every quarter together with the 

health and safety committee in order to update workplace safety protocols. If there are new products or 

equipment to be launched or purchased, as the case may be, more management meetings will be held. 

 

UMF conducts safety training programmes annually. These include safety personal protective equipment 

(PPE) training and fire drills. In addition, we have off-site training for our staff in more specialised areas 

such as planning for handling of chemicals and confined space operations. 

 

In FY 2019, UMF conducted a combined 168 hours of training for of its personnel in areas covering plant 

and machinery, chemical handling, and ISO22000, labour law, and even multi-generational relationship 

management. 

 

In FY 2020, training decreased to just under 60 hours. This was due to the high number of training 

sessions which were carried out in FY 2019, and for FY2020, the training was on HACCP systems, Halal 

procedures, and Fire Safety management. 

 

UMF will continue to extend training for its personnel in relevant areas of their jobs. 

 

For SHC and TGF, training continues to be mainly on the job training. There are plans going forward to 

incorporate more soft skill training for personnel. 

 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Access management 

Access to the Group’s facilities and offices is granted via an access card system with visitors requiring 

visit permits. The access control system will only provide cards to new employees after job confirmation 

with the Group. New employees are registered as visitors prior to formal job confirmation. COVID-19 

Response Protocols have also been incorporated into the access management at our subsidiaries, and 

associate, in Malaysia. 

 

 

Ill-health related to work 

The Group documents all workplace-related health-related incidents along with a medical report. The 

health and safety committee will study how to avoid a recurrence of an incident and if deemed 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2020   -   14 

necessary, updated safety guidelines will be drafted by the committee for further dissemination and 

training. 

 

Management strives to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is at the top of our priorities 

at every level of the Group. KGL and all its subsidiaries abide by government and industry health and 

safety regulations. We have adequate training for the workforce so that they may carry out their duties 

safely and confidently. 

 

Environmental matters are among the issues KGL takes most seriously. The Group remains committed to 

minimizing our environmental impact in all areas of the Group’s operations while preserving and 

enhancing the quality of life for employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.

their future development. 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

The Group has a non-discriminatory and equal opportunity employment hiring policy and will continue 

to monitor compliance with the policy carefully going forward. 

 

Child Labour &amp; Forced or Compulsory Labour 

We do not tolerate the use of child labour, nor exploitation of children, in any of our operations and 

facilities. Child labour, as defined by the International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) Convention is “work 

by children under the age of 12; work by children under the age of 15 that prevents school attendance; 

and work by children under of age of 18 that is hazardous to the physical or mental health of the child”. 

 

We shall and do not employ children that fall into the definition as stipulated by ILO Convention. 

 

We do not conduct business with partners who do not share our views on zero tolerance for child 

labour. 

 

The Group is committed to ensuring that there is no forced or compulsory labour in any part of our 

business and in our supply chain partners. We are committed to ethical and responsible dealings in our 

business relationships. Going forward, we continue to strengthen adherence to our policy against child 

labour or exploitation of children. 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2020   -   17 

 

Employment Policy 

We do not practice discrimination in employment of staff.  Our hiring policy is based on merit based, 

depending on the experience, competence and qualifications of the relevant candidates. We will closely 

monitor our managers for compliance with the aforesaid hiring policy. 

 

Anti-corruption Policies and Procedures 

We shall and do not engage in bribery or any form of financial crime. All staff must never offer, promise 

or give bribes in connection with our business and they must never ask for or accept bribes. At KGL, we 

have company policies that all employees are to be made aware of the anti-corruption policies and 

procedures. 

 

 

Governance 

 

Corporate Governance and Risk Management 

Please refer to our Risk Management Policies and Processes in accordance with the Singapore 

Exchange’s Code of Corporate Governance of our financial statements for FY2020 for further details. 

 

Regulatory Compliance 

Throughout FY2020, there have been no incidents of non-compliance with the socioeconomic 

goals, laws and regulations we have identified as relevant to the Group, which are described in 

more detail in this report (including the below-mentioned). 

 

Practices to manage regulatory compliance 

Laws and regulations relevant to our operations are mainly the Companies Act (Chapter 50) and Listing 

Rules of the Singapore Exchange, Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289), The Singapore Code on Take-

overs and Mergers and other industry specific laws and regulations. The Group believes in instilling its 

employees with a culture of compliance and a high standard of ethics in carrying out their duties. This 

would mitigate any 

non-compliance as we understand good governance would allow the Group to manage its risks 

and opportunities, and deliver sustainable returns or value for our stakeholders. 

 

 

 

 

 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2020   -   18 

Employees 

All employees are briefed on the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, and the Whistleblowing policy 

during the orientation and induction programme. KGL and its subsidiaries receive regular updates from 

relevant authorities on changes to regulations, which are relevant to its operations. Staff members may 

also attend seminars to familiarise themselves with any such updates. 

 

Developed and implemented a Board Assurance Framework with an Enterprise 

Risk Management Framework 

The Group regularly review its operations to identify significant risks it faces, the potential 

impact and likelihood of such risks, and the effective action plans undertaken to mitigate those 

risks. 

 

Results of Monitoring Effectiveness 

The Audit Committee (“AC”) and the Board have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 

controls 

in relation to significant risks, including financial, operational, compliance-related controls, as 

well as the risk management system and found them to be adequate and effective as at 31 July 

2020. 

 

Perpetual Target 

KGL aims to maintain “zero” incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations. 

 

Performance for FY2020
