Hydropower Generation  

The Group is the largest player in the Sri 

Lankan mini hydro power plant sector, 

currently owning and operating 13 mini 

hydropower plants across 4 regions in Sri 

Lanka, with a total capacity of 43 MW. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solar Power Plants 

 

Through our joint venture, Charisma 

owns and operate a 140 MW solar 

photovoltaic power plant in Rajasthan, 

India. The solar plant which was 

commissioned in December 2017, is 

located in the Bhadla Solar Park, which 

is slated to be the largest of its kind Solar 

Park in India once all the plants in the 

Park are fully commissioned.  

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, the Group also owns and operates 

an agrophotovoltaic (“APV”) based, 20 MW 

solar photovoltaic power plant in the Hubei 

province in central China. The plant was 

successfully commissioned in late January 

2018. 

 

Whilst land-based photovoltaic power plants 

compete with agriculture for acreage, APV 

plants accommodate both activities by installing 

solar panels above crops. This dual use of land 

results in resource efficiency and creates 

additional jobs for farmers.

consultation with the Board of Directors. The Group’s Sustainability Taskforce (“the 

Taskforce”), which includes senior management executives, is led by the Group’s Chief 

Executive Officer, and is tasked to develop a sustainability strategy, review material impacts, 

consider stakeholder priorities, set goals and targets as well as monitor sustainability 

performance.  

 

The Board oversees the process of engaging stakeholders and identifying material topics by 

reviewing reports and information provided by the Taskforce. The Board has considered 

sustainability issues as part of our strategic formulation, and approved the material 

environmental, social and economic topics identified and overseen that the factors identified 

are managed and monitored.  

 

The Taskforce has reviewed the option for external assurance of its sustainability report. The 

Taskforce has assessed that external assurance is not required for FY2018 as the Group 

wishes to progressively strengthen the sustainability reporting framework.

covering our Group’s performance from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.  

 

The GRI standards represent the global best practices for reporting on economic, 

environmental and social topics. The report also incorporates primary components of report 

content as set out by the SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements on sustainability reporting. 

The Group has assessed the external assurance is not required as the Group is laying the 

foundations for a sustainability reporting framework this year. 

 

This report supplements the Group’s 2018 Annual Report and is available on SGX. Detailed 

section reference with GRI Standards is found at GRI Standards Content Index section of this 

report.  

 

The Group’s material topics are identified based on their impacts on our internal and external 

stakeholders, as outlined in the Stakeholders Engagement section.

Reduction of Carbon Footprint  

 

At the heart of the fight against climate change is the absolute and undeniable necessity for 

renewable and sustainable energy. Charisma prides itself in being at the forefront of that 

movement through bringing clean energy to the world for our future generations.  

 

Energy and Emissions Management (GRI 302-4, 305-1, 305-2) 

 

The nature of our business model contributes towards the reduction of the carbon footprint, 

as electricity generation from renewable energy sources replaces electricity generation from 

burning fossil fuels. By harnessing sustainable energy, we not only reduce harmful 

greenhouse gas emissions but also cut down the use of limited resources.  

 

The Group’s India and China solar plants were commissioned in December 2017 and January 

2018 respectively, and had generated 301.9 MWh and 22.1 MWh in 2018 respectively. The 

Group looks forward to a further contribution towards a greater renewable energy output and 

the resulting reduction of carbon footprint in 2019.  

 

Climate Change: Opportunities and Risks (GRI 201-2) 

 

The reliance on natural elements in the nature of our business is such that output can be 

subject to weather conditions. In 2016, Sri Lanka experienced one of the worst droughts in its 

history. This impacted our Hydro Power assets in the country and profitability suffered as a 

result.  

 

However, the Group is of the view that while climate change poses challenges and potential 

risks, it brings about opportunities as well. The need for renewable energy will continue to rise.  

 

As such we plan to continue to invest in projects that will help combat climate change and 

safeguard our planet for future generations.

Local Communities and Environment  

 

Charisma works with nature, not against it. We also see local communities and the 

environment as enablers for our vision and mission to build a future for the world with 

renewable and sustainable energy.  

 

Giving back to the community (GRI 203-2, 413-1, 413-2) 

 

Charisma believes that community engagement is an integral part of our business 

sustainability.  We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and we endeavor to 

give back to the community.    

 

The jobs we create benefit stimulate the local economy and support our commitment towards 

being a responsible corporate citizen. The Group also adopts a “hire local” policy in the 

countries we operate in.  

 

Some of the CSR activities the Group have conducted include donating to children’s homes, 

hospitals and schools as well as providing aid for land slide victims.   

 

The Group is also committed to making economic contributions to the countries in which it 

operates in through paying its fair share of corporate taxes to the governing bodies of the 

countries. We adhere strictly to the business framework set up in each country to ensure 

compliance to the business ethics of operations. 

 

Flora and Fauna (GRI 304-1, 304-2, 304-3) 

 

Our solar plants in India are located in the Rajasthan desert and do not require excessive 

water use, deforestation or vast areas of land to be cleared prior to installation.  

 

Our Hydro Power Assets are small and do not divert large bodies of water or harm marine 

wildlife. No chemicals are added to water during the process. Our dams (weirs) for Mini Hydro 

power plants are low and use run-of-the-river water without storage. The diversion of water is 

confined only from weir to power-house and thereafter water is returned to the original stream.  

 

We also ensure strict adherence to all Environmental Flow regulations prior to the 

commencement of projects. 

 

Social-Compliance (GRI 307-1, 406-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-1, 419-1) 

 

During FY2018, the Group had no incidents of non-compliance with environmental and 

socioeconomic laws and regulations. 

 

These include labour laws in India, China and Sri Lanka that require us to comply with 

minimum wage, employee benefits as well as overtime compensation regulations, as well as 

other environmental, utilities, human rights and land laws.  

 

 


14 

 

Our People 

 

The Group puts employees at the heart of the organisation, and understands the value and 

importance of its human capital. 

 

Our Workforce (GRI 401-1, 401-2, 401-3, 405-1) 

 

We train and groom our staff to equip them with the necessary skills for career development. 

We remunerate staff based on local market practices whilst adhering to local wage legislation, 

including minimum wages if applicable.   

 

We uphold employee welfare and have various schemes in place to ensure that our full time 

staff receive strong and competitive employee benefits aligned with local legislations and 

market practices.  

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity (GRI 405-1, 405-2) 

 

The Group is committed to ensure that all staff are treated with dignity and respect. Staff are 

treated equally regardless of age, race or gender and are given opportunities to be stretched 

to their fullest potential. 

 

We endeavour to provide employment opportunities for the local communities we operate in. 

For our regional operations outside of Singapore, 98% of employees are locals.   

 

Non-Discrimination (GRI 406-1) 

 

Our employment practices are non-discriminatory in nature and are based solely on job-

related factors. Our employees are remunerated, employed and promoted based on 

performance, and the potential and willingness to take on higher responsibility or job scope, 

without reference to any distinction or preference made on the basis of race, national origin, 

religion, sex or marital status.
