ESG IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS

Globally, IT and software firms can have significant 

environmental and social impacts. By understanding 

these potential issues, Procurri can capitalise on the 

services it provides.

Headquartered in Singapore, Procurri is a leading global independent provider of Lifecycle Services 

and data centre equipment. We aim to be the global aggregator of IT services and enterprise hardware 

to our channels, offering a converged network and sharing platform that combines the technology, 

finance and logistics domains that change the way the world buys technology. Procurri employs 

more than 400 employees across its 14 offices worldwide, with an extensive operations and services 

coverage spanning over 100 countries.

Procurri works to keep its environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance positive by being 

a responsible, diverse and equal opportunities employer, extending product life where possible to 

reduce society’s carbon and waste footprint.

ESG IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS

Technology is rapidly evolving and changing our lives in ways that were unimaginable just a mere 

decade ago. All modern economies rely on technology and information services to develop and grow. 

The combined use of software and hardware systems helps in the development of economically 

important products by increasing efficiencies and providing new services. With the sudden overhaul 

of existing systems or technologies that is taking place due to innovation in Information Technology 

and Communications, new challenges for sustainability are becoming material. New technology 

brings with it new social and environmental externalities that need to be addressed in order to protect 

stakeholders.

Being proactive in material sustainability issues provides companies with the opportunity to increase 

their value, both in business and financial terms. Focusing on these key materiality issues will allow 

companies to positively impact their growth both in terms of profit and customers, while failure to 

address externalities can cause harm to the company’s reputation and profits.

Understanding the environmental and social impacts from software and IT firms will allow Procurri to 

capitalise on the services it provides. Our sector has tremendous potential to not just fuel growth but 

to also help economies progress in a sustainable manner.


Board Statement

Introduction | Board Statement | Material ESG Factors &amp; Reporting Framework | 

As a leading global player in the enterprise IT services and hardware industry, Procurri is aware of the 

importance of good corporate citizenship.

The ethos of our business is deeply entrenched in the three Ps of the Triple Bottom Line – People, Planet 

and Profit – coined by John Elkington, a world authority on corporate responsibility and sustainable 

development. Our Hardware Resale encourages the use of pre-owned or refurbished equipment and 

our Independent Maintenance Services enable companies to prolong the lifespan of their enterprise 

hardware, while our IT Asset Disposition empowers companies to dispose off e-waste responsibly.

In compliance with the Singapore Exchange’s sustainability reporting framework, we are proud to be 

publishing our second Sustainability Report 2018. This complements our ongoing green effort with 

the electronic dissemination of our Annual Report 2018 to shareholders via our corporate website. 

This report evidences the ESG key performance indicators (KPIs) that are material to the practices 

of Procurri, identified using established materiality assessment of the Sustainability Accounting 

Standards Board (SASB) and refined for purpose by an independent consultant.

Procurri recognises the importance of good governance for continued growth and investors’ 

confidence. Furthermore, it has set targets for the short, medium and long term to strive to improve 

its performance. Analysis has identified the most significant cause of GHG emissions in Procurri 

operations is associated with electricity consumption. In contrast to many companies in the IT sector, 

embedded energy of equipment is not the most significant impact, as Procurri sources equipment 

from pre-used sources, resulting in a net benefit carbon footprint for the products.

Having considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, the Board has approved 

the material ESG factors identified, and ultimately oversees the management and monitoring of all 

ESG factors.

The ethos of our business is deeply entrenched in the 

three Ps of the Triple Bottom Line – People, Planet 

and Profit. Our businesses encourage the reuse and 

recycle of enterprise hardware equipment, resulting 

in a net benefit carbon footprint for the products.

Identifying the impacts that are material to investors and other stakeholders is crucial for IT companies 

in order to streamline available resources.

Procurri recognises the importance of identifying issues that are significant to the financial operation 

of the business, as well as stakeholders, such as investors, society and customers. This report focuses 

on the regional head offices of Procurri in Singapore; Atlanta, in the United States of America (“USA”); 

and Cirencester and Warrington in the United Kingdom (“UK”). Where available, data from Rockland 

Congruity LLC, a joint venture set up in January 2017 with its office in Massachusetts (which is now 

a wholly owned subsidiary as of 1 April 2019), has also been included in our 2018 sustainability 

performance data. These sites represent our key locations and cover 90% of the total employees of 

Procurri’s global operations. The remaining 10% of employees are widely spread across numerous 

geographical bases.

When considering materiality, Procurri conducted a two-phase assessment in 2017. It initially 

considered all sector-level materiality to identify all issues relevant to companies operating in the 

sector. These themes were identified using the SASB Hardware, Software and IT standards, investor 

trend review and a wider literature review.

Sector-level materiality was identified and refined based on specific practices of the company, 

through an internal stakeholder engagement process with Procurri staff and the Board in 2017, and 

also on-site data collection. Many of these issues are not applicable to Procurri due to its specific 

operations. To give an example, one of the most significant causes of environmental impact in the 

sector is the production of the hardware itself – including sourcing of raw materials, such as rare 

metals. However, as Procurri sources its equipment from recovered units, and is essentially replacing 

the need for additional original equipment manufacturing, few virgin raw materials are required. As 

such, the environmental footprint of equipment is not relevant to Procurri.

Exhibit 1 highlights the material ESG issues identified for Procurri. Sector material issues that are not 

relevant to Procurri, but were considered, are represented with dark grey shading, while issues that are 

immaterial for the sector and operations are coloured light grey.

REUSE &amp; RECYCLING OF IT EQUIPMENT

Procurri’s IT distribution and Lifecycle services serve to optimise the performance and lifespan of 

IT assets, thereby empowering partners and clients to retain the value of their IT assets as much as 

possible, and contributing to a circular economy.

Refurbishment and reuse of equipment prolong its useful life with minimal environmental cost, and are 

the preferred approach for a sustainable waste management solution.

EXHIBIT 3: WASTE HIERARCHY AT PROCURRI

In 2018, Procurri conducted almost 13,760 service and maintenance jobs, resulting in over 400,000 

equipment and component pieces to be made available for reuse.

When products reach a stage where it is no longer economically viable, Procurri provides a service 

that ensures environmentally sound recycling into raw materials for reuse, both diverting material 

from landfill and incineration, and preserving resources by avoiding virgin material extraction for new 

products.

OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT

Procurri extends the life of equipment wherever 

possible and in 2018, conducted almost 13,760 service 

and maintenance jobs. More than 400,000 items were 

made available for reuse in 2018.

Procurri considers environmental responsibility to be crucial to the successful operation of its business 

and operates both its UK and Singapore sites to the environmental management system standard ISO 

14001, and quality management standard ISO 9001. It has set a target to achieve these standards 

across US operations by 2022.

Procurri’s operational environmental footprint was analysed based on onsite energy use, water use, 

vehicle fuel and business travel.

For the purposes of this report, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to air are reported in line with the 

Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an international corporate accounting and reporting framework developed 

by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The 

Greenhouse Gas Protocol differentiates between direct and indirect emissions using a classification 

system across 3 different scopes:

SCOPE 1

includes direct emissions 

from sources which 

a company owns or 

controls. This includes 

direct emissions from fuel 

combustion and industrial 

processes.

SCOPE 2

covers indirect emissions 

relating solely to the 

generation of purchased 

electricity that is consumed 

by the owned or controlled 

equipment or operations of 

the company.

SCOPE 3

covers other indirect 

emissions including 

third-party provided 

business travel.

1 The increase in purchased electricity is due to the acquisition of Rockland Congruity LLC. 2018 purchased electricity excluding 

Rockland Congruity LLC, i.e. on same basis as 2017 data, would be reduced to 1,288,318kWh. Data for Rockland Congruity LLC 

has been estimated by headcount based on figures of the Atlanta office.

data, would be reduced to 461 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

3 The increase in water withdrawal is partially due to the acquisition of Rockland Congruity LLC. 2018 water withdrawal excluding 

Rockland Congruity LLC, i.e. on same basis as 2017 data, would be increased to 2,537 cubic metres. Data for Rockland 

Congruity LLC has been estimated by headcount based on figures of the Atlanta office.

SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT

In the year 2018, Procurri organised various activities for community participation and social 

engagement.

The US team has been involved in a new charity campaign to provide housing to underprivileged 

families in El Salvador. The team led by Daniel Kedme reached out around the world to Procurri’s 

network of employees, customers, partners and friends, and raised US$8,835 which would provide 

two 3D-printed homes. The US team has also contributed to community empowerment through 

donations to the Boy Scouts of America and in the form of a Procurri scholarship worth US$5,000 for 

the Gwinnett Technical School.

The Europe office has once again contributed to the Jumbulance Trust which is a charity that provides 

convenient travel opportunities to adults and children with disabilities or chronic illnesses. Led by 

Emily Stratford, the Jumbulance vehicle which is fully equipped with medical facilities took the group 

to enjoy several places in Amsterdam including the Dolphinarium at Harderwijk, the seaside by 

Egmond aan Zee, the Alkmaar Cheese Market and the town of Beemster. The Europe office has also 

sponsored a ‘buggy run’ organised by Gary Jones. As part of this initiative, funds are raised to provide 

buggies for families with children of special needs. Through a challenge to run an additional mile each 

day throughout August, over 200 miles were covered and £10,000 were raised which, along with 

Procurri’s donation of £250, provided new buggies for seven families with funds for more.









The Asia Pacific office based in Singapore was involved in organising a shoes donation drive. This 

involved team participation which resulted in successfully collecting more than 50 pairs of shoes. 

These shoes were then sent to a non-profit organisation called Soles4souls which works internationally 

to distribute shoes to the needy.

Governance

 Environmental Impacts | Social Impacts | Governance | Targets &amp; Policies | Appendix 

Procurri operates with company policies of Equal Opportunities, Code of Conduct, Employee Diversity 

and Inclusion, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Grievance Process and Disciplinary Policy, all 

reflecting a commitment to respect workers in both its own business and its supply chain worldwide. 

The following section considers some of the key governance structures in place.

BOARD DIVERSITY

The Board currently comprises five directors, three of whom are independent non-executive directors. 

As independent non-executive directors make up half of the Board, the Board is able to exercise 

objective judgment independently from management and no individual or small group of individuals 

dominate the decisions of the Board. Currently, the Board consists of five males, with combined 

expertise across a range of specialties, including finance, accounting, legal, business and industry 

knowledge. Procurri provides detail of its Corporate Governance in an annual report which can be 

found here.

DATA &amp; SECURITY

Procurri is bound by privacy regulations around the world. To ensure Group-wide compliance, the Data 

Protection Policy was formalised during the financial year 2018. Procurri does not collect personal 

client data as part of its business operations or for use in its business operations. Procurri comes into 

contact with client data as part of its IT Asset Disposition offering, when clients entrust their end-of-life 

IT equipment to Procurri for testing and verification, data erasure and/or disposal. Procurri handles 

these electronic equipment with utmost security and ensures data security is maintained at all times. 

Telephone numbers, customer identification numbers, address details and other personal information 

is destroyed as part of the IT Asset Disposition process and not stored for ongoing use.

Each region operates to local requirements and best practices, though key processes are the same. 

Asset testing and verification premises are in a caged and secure location and only accessible by 

authorised personnel. All storage equipment that is erased has certificates generated citing the type of 

erasure standard requested. For data erasure, Singapore operations use Blancco certification, an ISO 

27001-- compliant third party data erasure provider. The UK uses both ISO 27001 and ADISA ICT 

Asset Recovery Standard, for which it is externally audited.

For asset disposal, the three regions use third-party vendors detailed below:

• 

Singapore: National Environment Agency-approved vendor.

• 

USA: R2-certified recycler audited annually.

• 

UK: UK Environment Agency licensed and authorised recycler.

practice. It strives to continuously improve its ESG performance and, as such, has set a series of public 

targets in 2017 to achieve in the short, medium and long term.

• 

Formalise an Investor Relations policy by 2018.

• 

Expand social data coverage to include employee training hours for all fourregional headquarters 

by 2020.

• 

Expand ISO 14001 &amp; 9001 certification to the US office, in line with its Singapore and UK regional 

headquarters, by 2022.

In 2018, Procurri’s Investor Relations Policy was formalised. It sets out the ethos of Procurri’s 

communication with its shareholders and the key principles built on the virtues of good corporate 

governance, adequate corporate transparency and fair disclosures.

Procurri is on track to meet the rest of the targets.

“Procurri considers responsible management of ESG

CALCULATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

Different GHGs have different Global Warming Potentials (GWP)5 or abilities to contribute to rising 

temperatures. Data is standardised by converting the different greenhouse gases into their carbon 

dioxide equivalent according to the GWP index published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 

Change (IPCC)6. The index identifies the radiative effects of different GHGs in the atmosphere relative 

to an equal mass of CO2 over a 100-year timeframe. GWP enables all the GHGs to be expressed in 

terms of CO2 equivalents, or CO2e. Quantities of GHG emissions are derived from data on operational 

and vehicle fuel consumption, electricity use and business travel. Emission factors are from Singapore’s 

Energy Market Authority, United States Environment Protection Agency and Procurri’s electricity 

suppliers in the UK.

5 Global Warming Potential (GWP) is the ratio of the warming of the atmosphere caused by one substance to that caused by a 

similar mass of carbon dioxide, which is assigned a reference value of 1.

6 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the World Meteorological 

Organisation (WMO) and by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with a mandate to provide an objective source 

of information about climate change
