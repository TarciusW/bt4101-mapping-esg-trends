Covid-19 did not go away. Instead, it stubbornly remained 

in our midst and continued to pose unprecedented 

challenges to businesses and societies at large. It made us 

realized how fragile our environment can be and thought 

more deeply about what sustainability means.  

Lockdowns and border restrictions directly affected 

demand patterns and supply chains.  We felt this throughout 

our businesses.  Being well-diversified, we have some in-

built resilience and made good use of it to strengthen our 

operations and enhance our position in the market.  As we 

complied with new regulations to safeguard our assets and 

people against the virus, we also learned to appreciate the 

importance of building for a truly sustainable business in 

all the major aspects. FY2021 proved to be about making 

constant adjustments and improvements, committing 

resources for long term good and building up internal 

strength.

We believe this clear-minded approach has helped us to 

keep our leading position in the Specialist Relocation and 

Third Party Logistics business segments, in particular, our 

cross-border land freight operations.  We are grateful that 

our staff and management are fully aligned in thought and 

effort as well as for the support from our other stakeholders. 

Delivering high quality products and services and meeting 

meaningful sustainability goals can be peas in the same 

pod.  Increasingly, this is becoming the core of Chasen’s 

shared values.

A major and steadfast goal is the development of our 

people.  No effort was spared in this area, despite Covid-19, 

and we certainly are thankful for the relief provided by 

the Government.  There is no replacement for continuous 

training and development, especially as digitalization and 

new fintech-inspired business models take to the fore in 

so many markets.

 

As the world moves resolutely towards carbon neutrality, 

our goal to move in step with it has started and will not 

change.  To us, it is not a business cost.  Instead, it is good 

business.

ABOUT

OUR REPORT

COVID-19

MEASURES

At Chasen Holdings Limited (“Chasen”), we recognize the 

importance of sustainability to our business. As we embark 

on our sustainability reporting journey, the challenges 

and material issues relevant to our stakeholders, our 

strategy in managing these challenges and issues, and 

how we have performed in terms of our key performance 

indicators are highlighted in this report. This sustainability 

report comprises the performance of our consolidated 

entities in FY2021. It focuses on the Group’s sustainability 

strategies and practices while highlighting our activities 

and developments in economic, environmental, social, and 

governance aspects. This report outlines our approach, 

priorities, performance review, highlights, and targets on 

our crucial sustainability areas.

The material issues and topics outlined have been selected 

according to the significance of the company boundaries, 

our 

sustainability 

context, 

and 

our 

stakeholders’ 

expectations. The scope of all material issues disclosed 

in this report concerns the operations at the Group level. 

Likewise, our corporate governance and sustainability 

approaches are described from the policies and practices 

set at the Group level. 

2.1 

Report Methodology

This report is prepared based on the requirements of the 

‘In accordance-Core’ level of the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. 

Chasen has adopted Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards to be the reporting framework for sustainability 

reporting since FY2018. We have chosen GRI standards 

because they equip companies with flexible and future-

proof reporting structures. Also, GRI has been developed 

and rooted, upholding its strong credibility and robustness 

among companies’ stakeholders. They are the reporting 

framework that meets all needs for sustainability reporting 

– from comprehensive reports to issue-specific disclosures. 

Reference for GRI index can be found at page 33-37.

This report also consolidates the primary components of 

the report content as set out in the “Comply or Explain” 

requirements for sustainability reporting under Rule 711B 

in Mainboard Rules and Listing Manual of the SGX-ST (the 

“Listing Rules”). 

2.2 

      Report Structure

This Sustainability Report implies to reflect the interests 

of our key stakeholders. We have identified seven key 

stakeholder groups: employees, customers, suppliers, 

future generations, and communities. For each stakeholder 

group, we set out our management approaches regarding 

how material issues are identified and how such issues are 

The Path Ahead – Driving The Future Of Work

At Chasen, even when Covid-19 pandemic hit us hard, we 

identified and prioritized sustainability goals within our 

company. Aside from national standards, we put in place 

internal regulations to guard our workplace and people. 

The five resilience components identified: 

prioritized and managed. We will present our sustainability 

initiatives concerning environmental, social and economic 

issues relevant to our companies and boundaries. 

Subsequently, we will provide the information of our 

key performance indicators, performance targets and 

outcomes. The information regarding the basis for report 

boundaries and our materiality assessment is provided in 

section 6.

Altogether, this report provides the Chasen Group’s 

disclosures according to the SGX Sustainability Reporting 

Guidelines and the GRI-Standards “In-Accordance-Core”

two areas, which noticeably improved were internal 

communication and coordination, and adaptability in 

teamwork.

high alert of Covid-19 and we will continue to adopt in this 

new normal.

The Path Ahead: Driving the Future of Work

Chasen Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2021

With all this in-house measurement and policies in place, 

we are thus prepared for any resurgence of the spread of 

the virus and any measures that the government may take, 

including re-imposing a lockdown.

3.2 

Service Offering Resilience

The coronavirus pandemic has created new challenges for 

companies. To stay resilient, agile and opportunistic, we at 

Chasen have expanded our integrated business operations 

as follow:

• 

Specialist Relocation diversifying its customer base 

from the TFT LCD sector (in the PRC) to semiconductor 

and fabless chip manufacturers, as well as the organic 

light-emitting diode (“OLED”) industry and OEMs. 

• 

Demand for our 3PL services in warehousing and 

cross-border land freight services grew during the 

year as air and sea freight continue to be disrupted 

by pandemic-related constraints. Besides, we are 

looking to target other key long-term customers to 

enhance the resilience and margins of its revenue 

streams. 

• 

Pan-Asian cross-border land transportation services 

to remain robust. To meet the growing demand, 

Chasen intends to increase its fleet while also 

introducing more fuel-efficient and environment-

friendly vehicles. 

• 

In response to market conditions, Chasen has 

realigned its strategies to tap opportunities in solar 

panel installation, and interior space and exterior 

façade cladding works using specialized industrial-

grade glass and aluminium. 

• 

Extended buffer inventories for packaging materials, 

and optimum manpower plan to meet surge of demand 

upon lockdown due to pandemic. 

 

3.3 

Supply Chain Resilience

As the COVID-19 crisis mounted, highlighting risk 

assessment and flexibility with our key suppliers became 

our priority to identify any indirect exposures to supply 

shortage. We were working closely with our suppliers to 

ensure the risk of minimal disruption in supporting critical 

industries like logistics and contract manufacturing. We 

constantly looked for local alternatives for products to 

minimize operational uncertainty across borders and 

regions wherever possible. When Malaysia imposed its 

lockdown, we remained resilient and engaged in business 

continuity by taking proactive action to leverage continued 

service flow for cross-border transportation via land 

through our diesel, tires, and vehicle parts suppliers in the 

countries we operate in.

MEASURES

ESG HIGHLIGHTS

FOR FY2021

3.4 

Digitization and Cybersecurity

Companies are facing a time of significant change and 

reinvention. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have 

affected nearly every aspect of a company, from payroll 

to auditing standards to how companies conduct day-to-

day operations. At Chasen, digital transformation had to 

work swiftly for the team to adapt to a new normal. We 

deployed various technologies to enable staff to work 

from home without compromising on security.  To name, 

we migrated our server to Cloud and strengthened our 

firewalls. With technology becoming even more critical 

in both our working and personal lives, our cybersecurity 

team assured encryption technology, support team on 

standby, PDPA policies, and processes to mitigate data 

breach are in place. 

During this period, where the video-conference system 

became commonly used for meetings, we had lowered our 

International Direct Dial telephone costs.

3.5 

Financial Reporting

In the context where transparency is the key, there is an 

essential demand for reliable information to regain trust 

in unpredictable times. Part of it will be provided through 

financial reporting. The impact on financial reporting 

may not be the first thing that comes to mind due to the 

outbreak. Meanwhile, in such unprecedented times where 

digitization has displayed a dominant role in our daily 

operations, we, too digitized more financial processes to 

raise productivity and improved control as work-from-

home is the new norm. 

We developed more realistic targets based on current and 

historical business activities or trends so as to align and 

achieve budget results. We further stretched to monitor 

key performance indicators to measure against actual 

results. 

As the pandemic continues, we identified and implemented 

new controls that can provide the same assurance using 

different methods and information sources. Performing 

risk assessment on significant accounting processes 

where existing rules may need to be specifically catered 

and communicated to the current situation may hold 

considerable financial reporting implications. Lastly, we 

established regular communications with management 

to monitor impacts to the entity in upcoming financial 

reporting periods.

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 



































The following SDG goals are relevant to our business, operations and value chain. They are addressed in our various 

policies at the group level. Such goals are also embedded in various initiatives carried out across the organisation.

6.1 

Our Approach to Sustainability

With our vision and corporate values in mind, we aim to 

integrate sustainability into Chasen to be methodical 

and achievable at the Group level. Where feasible, we 

incorporate sustainability strategies in our agenda and 

decision-making processes. Our senior management drives 

the sustainability efforts, ensuring that the Company’s 

business objectives are align with our commitments 

to sustainable development. They are accountable for 

continuous communication to the Board of Directors to 

ensure the messages and actions across management levels 

are executed in a structured direction. Chasen’s senior 

management has defined the focus areas where Chasen 

can embed the most significant economic, environmental 

and social impact aspects and assure the objectives are 

met. 

Chasen has made efforts to seek the opinion of internal and 

external stakeholders both formally and informally. All in 

all, the expectations and objectives of our key stakeholders 

are crucial to building mutually beneficial relationships.

• 

Materiality: focusing on issues that impact business 

growth and are of top importance to stakeholders; 

• 

Stakeholder Inclusiveness: responding to stakeholder 

expectations and interests; 

•

company boundaries. Our data is an aggregation of our 

operations at the Group level over the last three years.

6.1.3 

Report Period and Scope 

This report covers data and information from 1 April 2020 

to 31 March 2021 and reviews Chasen’s achievements 

and performance towards Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) issues. This report has been prepared 

following the GRI Standards: Core Option. 

As part of our environmental conservation efforts, the 

current electronic edition of the report is available in our 

website:  www.chasen.com.sg   

6.2   

Accountability to Stakeholders

We strive to be a corporate responsible citizen by working 

closely with our stakeholders to understand their concerns 

and feedback. The stakeholder engagement provides 

valuable information for our sustainability reporting, 

particularly in determining the material environmental 

and social issues.  We will continue to engage our external 

stakeholders more extensively to identify areas that are 

material, sustainable and necessary for future development.

essential tool to meet the expectations of both internal 

and external stakeholders. It allows companies to focus 

their efforts on allocating resources better.

Unchanged from FY2020, Chasen focuses on 15 out 

of 22 identified materiality issues on high economic, 

environmental and social impacts that would substantially 

influence the assessments and decisions of shareholders 

and investors.

Economic Contribution to Society

At present, we are headquartered in Singapore, with 

operations extending across Asia and to the United 

States of America. We manage our operations following 

our sustainability principles. We work closely with our 

operation staff to distinguish and consider any sustainability 

opportunities and risks that may arise.

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource 

scarcity and demographic changes shape the competitive 

environment in which companies like Chasen operate 

by advancing long term sustainability opportunities 

and recognizing risks. We, therefore, view our business 

performance beyond short-term gains and financial 

bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve a balanced triple 

bottom line (People, Profit, Planet) for sustained growth for 

the organization and the community it operates in. 

The achievement of our business is highly dependent 

on the commitment of our management and staff. Their 

knowledge, professional expertise and their job satisfaction 

are key to our economic sustainability.

Importantly, we strive to contribute positively to society 

through our economic presence by serving as Asia Pacific’s 

leading specialist relocation and third-party logistics 

company in Singapore, Asia and the United States of 

America. We sustain good stewardship of the resources 

we manage and generate returns that would fulfil 

shareholders’ value. 

Our business model focuses on cost leadership without 

compromising our service level and highest priority on 

customer’s interest. We seek systematic growth from the 

existing outlets and the acquisition of new businesses that 

reap good returns.

We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring 

we gain the trust of our customers and their families 

and continually build our reputation and brand name in 

specialist relocation and third-party logistics industry in 

the Asia Pacific.

The Group’s vision is to offer integrated services combining 

technical and engineering capabilities to complement 

logistics services. As the vision is being realized, the Group 

would magnify its competitiveness beyond pricing. 

As a Group, Chasen advances to make good progress. The 

current financial year is expected to be another watershed 

as each subsidiary successfully implements its strategic 

business plans approved by the Board last financial year. 

As book orders continue to build up and projects executed 

across our three business segments, we aspire to achieve 

another record in annual revenue in line with global 

economic growth opportunities.

Chasen has, beyond sustained earnings, diligently 

embraced prudent financial management in today’s 

highly volatile business environment, capitalized on our 

assets and investments, and remained focused on growth 

strategies to enhance shareholders’ value.

performance, please refer to financial highlights in pages

ALIGNMENT WITH

INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES

GOVERNANCE

8.1   

United Nations 17 Sustainable Goals

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 

ambitious plans set by United Nations for a better world. 

The goals are to be achieved by 2030.

The SDGs provide worldwide guidance for addressing the 

global challenges facing the international community. The 

17 goals cover all three areas of sustainable development: 

ecological, economic and social.

Companies around the globe can contribute as part of their 

core business to measure the impact of their activities, set 

ambitious targets and disclose their progress transparently. 

SDGs have enormous potential for changing the global 

climate.

8.2 

 Our SDG Goals

9.1   

Legal Compliance and Corporate Governance

Corporate governance and compliance have always been 

one of the top priorities for the Company. The decision-

making process in the Company is strictly in line with 

legal and regulatory requirements and in compliance with 

the Code of Corporate Governance issued by Monetary 

Authority of  Singapore and the Company Act of Singapore.

The Company has not received any correspondences or 

notifications concerning any non-compliance of legal 

and regulatory requirements or the Code of Corporate 

Governance from any government and regulatory agencies 

in FY2021. The Audit Committee received no whistle-

blowing letters during the year.

9.2 

Ethics &amp; Integrity

We promote an ethical and act with integrity’ culture 

throughout the Company and our subsidiaries. We seek to 

conduct our business ethically and comply with the best 

practices in all the three business segments. All Directors, 

operations and management staff are obligated to fully 

comply with our principles set in our Employee Handbook 

and employment contract.

The Employee Handbook details our expected standards 

of employee’s professional behavior towards our business 

partners whom we have business dealings with, to the 

people in the society whom we serve as customers and 

towards each other as employees of the Company. Above 

all, we are inculcated with solid corporate values to act 

with integrity.

9.2.1 

Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud

With a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption,  we 

have put effective monitoring and management control 

systems to detect bribery, fraud or other malpractice 

activities right at the root. We have established a whistle-

blowing mechanism for employees and other concerned 

stakeholders such as customers and their families, 

suppliers,  competitors and contractors.

A 

direct 

whistle-blowing 

channel 

has 

also 

been 

implemented to empower our employees to get immediate 

access to the Audit Committee. Our stakeholders can be 

assured that all reports or suspicions of potential breaches 

of our Employee guidelines are practiced seriously by the 

Group.

9.2.2 

Compliance with Laws and Regulations

The Group is proactive in ensuring its compliance with 

all relevant laws and regulations. Our management team 



































The following SDG goals are relevant to our business, 

operations and value chain. They are addressed in our 

various policies at the group level. Such goals are also 

embedded in various initiatives carried out across the 

organisation.

We do not believe these goals are relevant to our business 

and industry. They are not within our boundaries and scope 

of influence, therefore, we are currently unable to make 

noticeable contributions to such goals.

is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Group’s 

policies and practices regarding legal and regulatory 

requirements across all operations.  Any non-compliance 

of the relevant laws and regulations and the proposed 

resolutions will be reported to the Board of Directors 

quarterly.

Any new enactment of or changes to the relevant laws and 

regulations will be communicated to all operations and 

management staff via emails and small group meetings. 

Such communication is necessary to ensure that all staff 

are aware of the changes and carry out the required steps 

and efforts to ensure compliance.

While we attempt to leverage our data to serve our 

customers responsibly, we adhere and uphold the Personal 

Data  Protection Act (“PDPA”). We have implemented 

policies to ensure we comply with PDPA and respect 

our customers’ choices regarding their data and privacy 

protection.

There is no incidence of product and service misinformation 

and labeling or marketing communications.

9.2.3 

Risk Management

The Group acknowledges the importance of risk 

management and how business risks may adversely affect 

Chasen’s business performance.

While it is the Audit Committee’s responsibility, as delegated 

by the Board of Directors, to oversee the effectiveness 

of our risk management and internal controls, the core 

function of the internal audit is coordinated by our Chief 

Financial Officer, who reports to the Audit Committee 

periodically.

9.3 

Customer Privacy and Data Protection

The nature of our business warrants a high level of 

security and confidentiality of our clients’ data as well 

as the business transactions they have undertaken. We 

adhere strictly to the guidelines set by the Personal Data 

Protection Act (PDPA).

We have entrusted to ensure our proprietary IT system 

meets the highest standards for IT security. There is no 

incident of non-compliance with laws and regulations in 

the social and economic area reported.

9.4 

Supply Chain and Procurement Services

We have secured a strong partnership with the suppliers 

for our three businesses. We believe in transparency in our 

supply chain and our approach is to engage with suppliers

if we identify any concerns positively. Any non-compliance 

with local and international regulatory bodies’ guidelines 

will result in us not embarking on or discontinuing the 

procurement and business relationship with them.

9.5 

Service Quality and Responsibilities

For Chasen, our service quality and responsibility to our 

customers rank high for the company’s sustainable success. 

We are committed to provide reliable and high-quality 

solutions to our customers and every customer we service. 

We emphasize service excellence to every customer. 

Our operations and professional staff serve our customers 

professionally and ethically.

10.1 

Water and Energy Conservation

We strive to embrace environmental sustainability by 

managing environmental conservation through adopting 

‘Reduce’, ‘Re-use’, ‘Recycle’ and energy efficient practices. 

As part of our efforts, we will align our environmental 

performance in our Group level operations to key evaluation 

criterion for water consumption and energy conservation 

for both electricity and diesel consumption.

10.1.1 Water 

In FY2021, water consumption at the group level has 

shown a jump of 52.1% in consumption from FY2020. 

Massive consumption in the PRC and Malaysia was the 

cause of the high water level consumed. Nonetheless, this 

was in line with the operational activities in the regions 

mentioned. We shall continue to look at ways to recycle 

the used water without compromising on the level of 

cleanliness required by the vendors and customers.

[NOTE: In 2019, water consumption records did not include 

our overseas subsidiaries.]

10.1.2 Electricity 

The electricity consumption has been relatively stable over 

the past three years. Although there was a slight increase 

of 17.1% in FY2021 compared to FY2020 and its spending 

has gone up by about 80%. 

10.1.3 Diesel

The 38% rise in consumption of diesel in FY2021 was 

due to the extensive usage in Malaysia. But this is in 

alignment with our increased land freight activities 

during this pandemic period. Since 2018, we have started 

acquiring electric forklifts in our efforts to cut down diesel 

consumption and reduce carbon emissions. Currently, 

we have 14 electric forklifts ranging from 2.5-ton to 16-

ton that are deployed to our subsidiaries in Singapore, 

Malaysia, Vietnam and PRC.

While we take conscientious efforts to conserve water 

and electricity, we are currently reviewing our utilisation 

pattern and will implement measures to reduce the 

consumption. Above all, we are continuously improving 

our energy conservation system across the regions.

10.2 

Waste Management

The Group also takes a concerted approach to ensure we 

adopt a responsible waste management process within 

our company operations. We will be reviewing and fine-

tuning our waste management system to ensure optimal 

recycling for all the raw materials, mainly wood and steel, 

to be appropriately disposed of or recycled. 

The significant drop in our waste management resulted 

from operation activities being disrupted at our sites due 

to lockdowns and workplace restrictions. In the past years, 

we have adopted the 3R methodology in waste solutions. 

We reduce waste by reusing and recycling materials 

where possible; for example, reusing wood from crates 

and wooden pallets and selling waste metal to recycling 

companies.

10.3 

Paper Usage

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives across all 

our operations and Corporate Office. The implemented 

initiatives aim to encourage the ‘Re-use,’ ‘Recycle’ and 

‘Reduce’ of papers through the following ways:

• 

‘Reduce’ the use of papers by sending the printers to 

print on double sides of each piece of paper and print 

only when necessary.

• 

‘Re-use’ 

single-side 

printed 

papers 

for 

non-

confidential and draft documents. We plan to roll 

out the daily operations reports to be electronic and 

paperless.

It has been a healthy increase in both the number of 

papers recycled and cost savings over the three years. We 

succeeded in reducing the quantity of paper consumed 

by approximately 16.85% from 5,902kg to 4,907kg, and 

79.45% of papers were recycled, up from 399kg to 716kg 

compared to FY2020.

10.5 

Steel Consumption 

While the quantity of steel consumed increased from 

FY2018, the expenditure spent on steel decreased 

dramatically over the three years. The rising amount of 

steel used directly correlated to the business volume of the 

related business units. Chasen Singapore is the main steel 

consumption source. 

10.6 

EHS Training &amp; Development

We strive to maintain a high commitment to training 

and development for our workforce. In FY2021, our 

total training hours have declined due to increased staff 

strength, but the average training hours per employee had 

gone up by a considerable gap. This performance aligns 

with the goals we set to raise the bar for EHS training and 

EHS hours by 20% in the next three years. We have plans to 

measure the carbon footprint and the Greenhouse Gases 

(GHG) Emissions of our business operations progressively 

over the next three years.

10.4 

Wood Consumption

A notable increase of approximately 189.8% in wood 

consumption from FY2020 to FY2021 was directly 

correlated with our business volume of the related business 

units in fabrication of pallets and crates for exporting 

purposes. The primary source, which contributed to it was 

our Vietnam subsidiary.

development in human resources is inevitable in advancing 

our business.

In FY2021, the overall turnover rate of 9.4% across Chasen 

Group and we have no temporary or part-time employees.

The flexi-work scheme was rolled out smoothly and 

expedited by the COVID-19 work from home requirements. 

Senior Management led the implementation by working 

at least two days a week from home while the rest of the 

staff adopted similar one to three days of working remotely 

from home to alternate the rollout with minimal disruption 

to the business operations.

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered 

by the Employment Act (Chapter 91) of Singapore, which 

provides basic employment terms and working conditions, 

including contract requirements, remuneration, hours of 

work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement. 

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the 

Employment Act, we provide beyond-compliance level 

benefits to our full-time employees.  Examples of these 

benefits include vacation, marriage and compassionate 

leaves.

11.7 

Work-Life Balance

While developing the talents of our employees and 

providing equal opportunities for them to excel are the key 

drivers for our company, we also recognize that the well-

being and contentment of our employees are pivotal to the 

success and sustainability of our business and performance. 

Our employees are our most valuable asset. We appreciate 

that their overall well-being needs to be well looked after 

to sustain their performance and realize their full potential. 

To support our employees in striking a work-life balance, 

we propose to create an environment that allows our 

employees to achieve harmony in their personal and 

professional lives. We intend to adopt a flexible approach 

to work arrangements and offering programs to support 

health and wellness. We understand that the workplace can 

be stressful due to the competitiveness of our workforce 

and our business. To support our employees in their effort 

to pursue excellence, we will launch various programs and 

initiatives to balance their work with fun and develop an 

environment and culture of mutual support.
