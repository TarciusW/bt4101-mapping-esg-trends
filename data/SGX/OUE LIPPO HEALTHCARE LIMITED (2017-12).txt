WHO WE ARE  

 

OUE Lippo Healthcare Limited (“OUE Lippo Healthcare”) provides high quality and sustainable 

healthcare facilities through our capabilities in the acquisition, development, management and 

operations of healthcare facilities. These facilities include medical centres, day surgeries, hospitals, 

nursing homes and retirement communities.  

 

We believe we can make a difference through good understanding of the present and future healthcare 

needs of the patient and his or her community. Our promise is delivered through our human talents, 

lean processes, technology and quality management. 

 

 

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

The Board of Directors is pleased to present our first Sustainability Report.  

 

The Board oversees, monitors and approves key sustainability related matters. The Board is supported 

by the Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”), which comprises key senior management personnel 

of the Group. 

 

Our Sustainability Report is aligned to the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B – Sustainability Reporting 

Guide and references the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 

(2016). We have adopted the GRI Standards (2016) as this is a well-known and globally-recognised 

sustainability reporting framework.  

 

We recognize how the alignment of healthcare and sustainability principles can enhance the function, 

practicality, effectiveness, perception and value of our healthcare services and facilities. We believe 

that it is important for us to focus on the areas where we can have the most impact. Therefore, the 

Board validated the results of a materiality assessment that was conducted to identify where to 

concentrate our sustainability efforts in areas which support our business strategy. In addition, we set 

out our performance for 2017 and targets for 2018. 

 

 

SUSTAINABILITY AT OUE LIPPO HEALTHCARE 

 

In 2017, we focused on the formalisation and standardisation of our sustainability approach. We 

focused our efforts in areas where we can have the most impact. This means looking at how we manage 

our physical assets, our human resource practices and compliance with our Code of Business Conduct 

and Ethics. Going forward, we will expand our focus to other areas.

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

This inaugural sustainability report addresses the material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

factors from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.   

 

Reporting Standard 

 

The report is referenced to the GRI Standards (2016) and is also in compliance with the requirements 

of the SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B.  

 

Reporting Scope 

 

The Group’s operations are divided into Healthcare Services and Property Investments.  

 

Under Healthcare Services, we own and operate the Wuxi New District Phoenix Hospital (“Wuxi 

Hospital”) in Wuxi, China. We also supply and distribute pharmaceutical products and medical 

equipment in China.  

 

The Wuxi Hospital is a 163-bed hospital and specialises in internal medicine, cardiology, general surgery, 

orthopaedics, ophthalmology, urology, dermatology, gynaecology, paediatrics and health screening.  

 

Under the Property Investments segment, we  own a portfolio of 12 nursing home facilities located 

across Japan, in the cities of Sapporo, Nara, Kyoto and Nagano. The facilities are leased to and operated 

by independent operators. The majority of residents at the facilities are on long-term stay basis of more 

than 10 years.  

 

We have investment properties under development, which include land adjacent to the Wuxi Hospital, 

land at Dujiangyan, China, which can be developed into an integrated healthcare facility, as well as land 

at Jalan Kia Peng, which is strategically located within the Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The land in Kuala 

Lumpur can potentially be developed into an integrated mixed-used development comprising specialist 

medical suites, upscale retail space and serviced residences. 

 

In this report, we focused on the material ESG factors for our Japan nursing homes, corporate human 

resource practices and compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

ACTIVE OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS 

We actively review our asset portfolio with the view of optimising the value of our assets. In this report, 

we will focus on our 12 nursing home facilities in Japan.  

 

Asset Management 

 

Proactive asset management helps to ensure regulatory compliance and management of reputational 

and operating risks. We conduct regular assessment of our assets and work closely with each nursing 

home operator to identify key issues, as well as to provide updates on applicable laws and regulations 

so as to ensure that our assets meet the required safety and regulatory standards. 

 

The master lease agreements with the operators define the responsibility between the asset owner 

and the lessee for repairs and maintenance of the nursing home facilities. Our management team in 

Japan, as the asset manager, prepares a maintenance capital expenditure (“CAPEX”) plan based on the 

requirements of the master lease agreements and regulatory requirements. The budget for the 

maintenance CAPEX plan is reviewed and approved by our Singapore Head Office. 

 

In 2017, we completed some of the following key maintenance CAPEX works. 

 

• 

Repairs and updates to lifts, elevators, steps and passageways  

• 

Maintenance of external façade/brickwork and windows  

• 

Maintenance of fire exits  

• 

Repair of water pipes  

• 

Repair of air filtration system  

 

Our 2017 Performance 

We assessed 100% of our assets and developed a maintenance CAPEX plan for each asset.  

 

2018 target  

We aim to continue to review and assess 100% of our assets and develop a maintenance CAPEX plan for 

each asset.  

 

TALENT MANAGEMENT 

 

We believe that our employees are a key factor of our success and we place significant emphasis on 

the recruitment and development of individual employees so that each employee can reach their 

maximum potential and make a positive contribution to the Group. We also endeavour to create a 

working environment where our employees feel valued and respected.  

 

Fair employment 

 

We abide by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair &amp; Progressive Employment Practices (“TAFEP”) guidelines in 

our recruitment and selection process.  We are committed to employing qualified candidates without 

any discrimination against age, gender, race, marital status or religion.

Learning, development and performance review 

 

Providing learning and development opportunities for our staff is an important tool to keep our staff 

both fully skilled and satisfied in their roles. Training programs for staff are recommended by line 

managers. These requests are reviewed and approved by the Human Resources team. Each year, all 

eligible staff receive annual performance appraisals, during which their unique development needs are 

assessed and addressed. Addressing their development needs is key to ensuring that we develop and 

retain our key talent. 

 

Staff wellbeing 

 

Investing in the wellbeing of our employees is part of creating a working environment which respects 

individuals and acknowledges achievements. Our employees are entitled to benefits such as:  

 

• 

Term life, hospitalisation and surgery, and travel insurance  

• 

Annual staff dinner and staff gatherings 

 

Our 2017 Performance 

We completed 100% performance appraisals for all our staff1. 

 

2018 target 

We aim to conduct 100% performance appraisals for all our staff1. 

 

COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS  

We are committed to maintain high standards of business conduct and uphold integrity and honesty of 

our operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”) sets out the expectations of 

employees in relation to issues such as fraud, bribery, segregation of duties and anti-competitive 

conduct. Upon commencement of employment, all employees are required to sign a certificate of 

compliance to indicate their willingness to adhere to the Code.  

 

We also have in place a whistle-blowing policy to provide a channel for employees to report concerns 

about possible fraud and other forms of misconduct. We do not permit retaliation or harassment of 

any kind against individuals for complaints submitted that are made in good faith. All complaints or 

concerns received are investigated by the Head of Internal Audit, who reports to the Chairman of the 

Audit and Risk Committee.  

 

Our 2017 performance 

No confirmed incidents of non-compliance resulting in a fine or penalty. 

 

2018 target 

No confirmed incidents of non-compliance resulting in a fine or penalty. 

 

 

 

 

1 The scope is based on employees at the Singapore corporate office.
