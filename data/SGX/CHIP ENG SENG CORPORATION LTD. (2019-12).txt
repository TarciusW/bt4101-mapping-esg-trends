Sustainability Report 2019 1

Reporting Period and Scope

ESG data and performance presented in this report is for the period 1 

January 2019 to 31 December 2019. The ESG information provided in 

this report mainly focuses on Chip Eng Seng’s construction and property 

development business in Singapore which contribute to 91% of the total 

Group revenue. This report includes employment data for the education 

division, a new business that started in August 2018, in Singapore unless 

stated otherwise. We plan to expand data coverage for the education and 

hospitality divisions progressively in the coming years as we continue to 

improve data collection mechanism.  ESG data from our overseas entities 

is currently excluded as they represent relatively small proportion of the 

total revenue. Also excluded from this report is CES_SDC Pte Ltd, an entity 

that Chip Eng Seng acquired in December 2019. However, we intend to 

include their data in a progressive manner in future reporting.

Reporting Framework

This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. We have used the GRI 

Standards as this is the most commonly used standards for sustainability 

reporting internationally. This report also complies with the SGX-ST Listing 

Rules (711A and 711B) and the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide. We 

have included a GRI Content Index at the end of the report to indicate the 

location of material ESG disclosures. 

We have continued to integrate the UN Sustainable Development Goals 

(“SDGs”) into our reporting process to indicate our contribution. Having 

aligned our material ESG factors with the SDGs in 2018, we identified the 

most relevant SDG targets in 2019 for deeper integration. 

We have calculated our greenhouse gas emissions using the Greenhouse 

Gas (“GHG”) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. We 

have reported our Scope-2 emissions using the location-based method as 

market-based emission factors are not available.

Reporting Principles 

We have developed the content of this report by referring to the 

ten reporting principles outlined in the GRI Standards (GRI 101: 

Foundation 2016). In line with GRI’s reporting principles, we have 

considered stakeholder views and the most material economic, social 

and governance impacts of our business activities. We have applied 

GRI’s principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability 

and timeliness to maintain quality of the information included in the 

report. ESG data provided in the report has been extracted primarily from 

internal information systems and primary records to ensure accuracy 

and consistency. International measurement units have been used for 

presenting the ESG data. Financial figures are in Singapore dollars unless 

specified otherwise.

Restatements

This report includes restated intensity figures for energy, carbon dioxide 

emissions, water and waste for 2018 due to an error in calculating the 

gross floor area built during the year.  Also, a minor adjustment of the 

greenhouse gas emissions data for 2018 has been made owing to the 

revision in the grid emission factors by the Energy Market Authority, 

Singapore published in 2019. 

Assurance

We have developed the content of this report in accordance with the GRI 

Standards. We have relied on internal verification to ensure the accuracy 

of the data. We did not seek external assurance for the content of this 

report.  External assurance for future reports remains under consideration.

Sustainability Report 2019 3

Construction

With nearly six decades of experience in general construction, the Group 

is engaged in the development of residential, commercial and industrial 

properties. Since 1982, when the Company won its first Singapore 

Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) project as the main contractor, 

the Group has continued to strengthen its position in HDB public housing 

construction. The Group’s penchant for quality and performance enabled 

it to win one of Singapore’s most coveted and iconic public housing 

projects – the Pinnacle@Duxton. With a solid reputation and track record 

in Singapore as a specialist in high-contract-value projects, the Company 

has also executed several “Design and Build” total turnkey projects for a 

number of established developers.

The Group conducts its Construction business through two wholly-owned 

subsidiaries: Chip Eng Seng Contractors (1988) Pte Ltd (“CESC”) and CES 

Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd (“CESE”). Both CESC and CESE have 

achieved A1 classifications as general building contractors – the highest 

awarded by the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”).

To build its capability in modular construction, the Group currently 

operates two precast yards, one each in Singapore and Malaysia. 2019 

saw the Group's construction segment expanding its capabilities to 

include infrastructure and civil engineering through its acquisition of 

CES_SDC Pte Ltd.

Property Development

The property development division is part of the Group’s growth strategy. 

The Group’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CEL Development Pte Ltd (“CEL”), 

is responsible for evaluating and acquiring potential sites and projects 

for Chip Eng Seng’s development and investment. CEL’s wide-ranging 

portfolio of residential, commercial and industrial projects caters to both 

mid-end and high-end markets.

Hospitality

Supporting the Group’s diversified growth strategy, the hospitality  

division focuses on strategically located hotel properties. Chip Eng Seng 

first ventured into the hospitality sector in 2015 with the opening of 

its first hotel, Park Hotel Alexandra. The Company’s hospitality portfolio 

includes Park Hotel Alexandra in Singapore, Grand Park Kodhipparu 

Resort in Maldives, The Sebel Mandurah Hotel in Western Australia and 

Mercure &amp; Ibis Styles Grosvenor Hotel in South Australia. A new Hyatt 

Regency at 51 Pirie Street in South Australia will be built and target  

to open its door in year 2023. A five-star resort in the Maldives is also 

under construction.

Property Investment

Chip Eng Seng’s property investment portfolio is made up of a  

diverse spread of income-producing properties comprising shophouses, 

office buildings and industrial properties in Singapore, Australia and  

New Zealand.

Education 

Since CES Education’s acquisition of White Lodge in 2018, the Group has 

expanded its portfolio to include preschools, international schools, and 

education technology businesses. Locally, CES Education set up its first two 

Repton School brand pre-school centres, Repton Schoolhouse Alexandra and 

Repton Schoolhouse Bukit Timah, pursuant to the Group’s collaboration with 

Repton International Schools Ltd. CES Education also acquired an effective 

interest of 70.06% (as at date of this report) in Invictus International School 

Pte. Ltd, which operates an international primary school and a pre-school 

centre in Singapore. CES Education has also partnered with a premier British 

independent school, The Perse School Cambridge, to set up The Perse 

School Singapore at Upper Bukit Timah Road.

As part of the Group’s plan to extend its global reach, the Group acquired 

a 100% interest in Raffles Campus (Malaysia) Pte. Ltd., which operates 

an international school known as Excelsior International School in Johor 

Bahru, Malaysia. The Group has announced the proposed acquisition of 

a childcare centre business in Tarneit, Victoria, Australia. The Group also 

recently stated that it has received the licences and approvals to commence 

operating an Invictus School brand kindergarten and primary school in 

Hong Kong. In China, the Group has incorporated Greenville Consultancy 

&amp; Management (Shanghai) Co, Ltd to manage and operate early learning 

centres for children aged 3-12 years.

In the education technology sphere, the Group completed its acquisitions 

of minority equity stakes in Amdon Consulting Pte Ltd, a provider of 

interactive content and pedagogical resources in the fields of science and 

technology, and Guangzhou Yuanda Information Development Co., Ltd, a 

provider of online education of mathematics to primary school students. 

The Group has also invested in Cybint International, which provides 

innovative education and training solutions and services in cybersecurity 

for all levels of expertise.

Group Chief Executive Officer’s Message

It is my pleasure to present Chip Eng Seng’s 3rd annual sustainability 

report. This report presents a summary of our sustainability performance 

in 2019. 

We continue to report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option 

as well as the SGX's Sustainability Reporting Guide.

In line with the GRI Standards, our sustainability efforts remain focused on 

managing our most significant economic, social and governance impacts. 

We continue to pursue sustainability strategies that help us maximise 

value for our stakeholders and contribute to sustainable development. 

Last year we had reported how we aligned our material ESG factors with 

the SDGs. In 2019, we continued strategic integration of the SDGs into our 

business by identifying specific SDGs targets to monitor our contribution 

to sustainable development. 

In our construction and property development business, climate action 

is an integral part of our sustainability strategy. We remain committed to 

continually reduce carbon dioxide (“CO2”) intensity in our construction 

activities as well as in managing our properties. 

We continue to pursue building designs, innovation and technologies 

that enhance the energy efficiency, water conservation and product 

quality. We carefully monitor our energy consumption, carbon dioxide 

emissions, water use and waste to identify opportunities for continuous 

improvement.

Ensuring health and safety at our construction sites remains a top  

priority for us. We carefully monitor our safety performance through 

regular reviews. In 2019, Chip Eng Seng continued to win recognition  

for excellence in workplace safety in various projects.

We remain committed to delivering high quality of construction and 

workmanship to our customers while completing our projects on or  

before time.   

Our Sustainability Management Committee, under the guidance and 

oversight from the Board of Directors, continues to work with various 

business segments and functions to implement our ESG strategy to 

support the sustainable growth of our business. We firmly believe that 

embedding sustainability into our operations will yield long-lasting value 

for our stakeholders.

I invite you to review this report that outlines how we are building a 

sustainable future for all our stakeholders.

Our Stakeholders

Engagement with stakeholders helps us understand their concerns, interests and expectations 

from us. A good understanding of the views and opinions of our stakeholders is essential to 

drive sustainable growth of our business. Our approach is to strengthen the relationship with our 

stakeholders through proactive engagement.

We identify our stakeholders based on the extent they are affected by our business activities or 

by their ability to influence our business goals. Our primary stakeholders comprise customers, 

employees, government, investors, suppliers and local communities.

We have continued to use the insights gathered through our ongoing interactions with a range 

of stakeholders throughout the year to determine material topics for sustainability reporting. The 

frequency of our engagement varies by stakeholder groups and depends on mutual needs and 

expectations. As such, we did not engage stakeholders specifically for the preparation of this report.

Our engagement with key stakeholders is described in the table below.

Our Sustainability Strategy

Sustainability is embedded across all stages of our building projects. Our focus is on managing the 

material economic, social and governance impacts of our business activities to maximise value for 

our stakeholders.

The building and construction industry has both positive and negative implications for the economy, 

environment and communities. The sector accounted for 36% of final energy use and 39% of energy 

and process-related CO2 emissions in 2018, 11% of which resulted from manufacturing building 

materials and products such as steel, cement and glass, according to 2019 Global Status Report for 

Buildings and Construction.

On the positive side, the real estate and construction sector plays a crucial role in the development 

of housing, industrial and business infrastructure needed for economic growth and sustainable 

communities. The construction industry also contributes to economic development by creating a 

significant number of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled jobs.

Chip Eng Seng plays a vital role in the development of affordable public housing in Singapore. A 

substantial part of our construction business comes from constructing the HDB's public housing 

where, according to HDB’s Annual Report 2018/2019, nearly 81% of the city state’s residents live.

Our approach is  

to build long-term  

value and manage  

our significant 

sustainability risks  

and opportunities  

to support the 

sustainable growth  

of the business.

Sustainability Report 2019 11

Climate Change

Buildings and construction activity consume a significant amount of 

energy and contribute to GHG emissions. Extreme weather patterns 

believed to be caused by global warming pose physical risks to buildings. 

We support the revised global goal of limiting the temperature rise well 

below 1.5˚ Celsius. We actively adopt the green design, energy efficiency 

and resource conservation in our projects.

Supporting Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals set the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development outlined through 17 Goals and 169 Targets. 

We have mapped our material ESG factors with the SDGs and identified 

the performance indicators at the target level where we can make a 

contribution. This report provides information about our ESG performance 

that is aligned with the SDGs. 

Our Approach to Materiality

We follow the GRI Standards and principles to determine material topics 

for sustainability reporting. Our materiality process entails assessing 

the most significant economic, environmental and social impacts of our 

business operations. We first evaluated our materiality sustainability 

issues in 2017 to identify Chip Eng Seng’s significant ESG factors. Senior 

management representatives from all business units and functions 

attended a materiality workshop conducted by an external sustainability 

expert to review and assess stakeholder concerns and the critical 

sustainability issues relating to our business activities. 

We have continued to conduct an annual review of our material ESG 

topics for sustainability reporting by taking into account the sustainability 

trends relevant to our sector. We have examined the material issues 

reported in our previous sustainability report and have determined that 

they mostly remain relevant for our 2019 Sustainability Report. Based on 

the review that included benchmarking against peers in the real estate 

and construction sector, we decided to classify materials as an emerging 

topic. While we have almost no control over how construction materials 

are manufactured, we also recognise that reducing the impact of materials 

requires sector-level innovation and the development of alternative 

materials. However, we continue to report on materials used  

in construction.

We have determined that diversity is not a material topic for our 

construction business where the workforce is predominantly male due 

to the physically demanding nature of the tasks. However, we have

Our Environmental Impact Management

Our environmental impacts are mainly associated with our building construction business. 

Significant environmental impacts of construction activities arise from the use of energy, water, 

materials and waste. Our approach is to minimise these impacts by adopting appropriate 

environmental policies, practices and technologies. 

Green building and sustainable living are also becoming important issues for our customers, 

tenants, employees, communities and regulators. We have implemented a Green and Gracious 

policy that promotes activities and initiatives to prevent and minimise the environmental impacts 

of our construction work. We are making efforts to reduce our environmental footprint by adopting 

sustainable practices that include green design, sustainable materials, innovation and efficient 

construction practices.

We conduct periodic reviews of our environmental policies, projects and initiatives to keep them 

updated and in line with industry trends.

Environmental Management 

Environmental management is a critical part of our Quality, Environment, Health and Safety (“QEHS”) 

system.  We have obtained ISO 14000 for our environmental management system that reflects our 

commitment to continuous improvement. Our Environmental Control Officers regularly assess the 

site works to ensure compliance with the applicable environmental and public health regulations.

Our environmental efforts focus on energy, GHG emissions, materials selection, waste management, 

water conservation, wastewater recycling, and noise and dust containment. We include energy 

efficiency and resource conservation goals throughout our value chain by incorporating  

sustainable features.

We are committed 

to mitigating our 

environmental impacts 

by adopting sustainable 

building designs, 

energy efficiency and 

technology.

Through our environmental management system, we measure and track 

our performance to identify opportunities for continuous improvement. 

We collect and review data for energy, water and waste on a weekly basis. 

We review our progress regularly against established goals and targets for 

these environmental metrics.

We constantly engage our employees, building authorities, contractors 

and suppliers to seek feedback and suggestions to improve our 

environmental performance. 

Mitigating Climate Change

In line with the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015, we support 

Singapore’s pledge to reduce the nation’s emissions intensity by 36% 

from 2005 levels by 2030 and stabilise the country’s greenhouse 

gas emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. We also back 

Singapore’s Climate Action Plan and Sustainable Singapore Blueprint to 

transition to a low carbon economy.

As a minimum, we adhere to the environmental standards set by HDB as 

well as BCA. To promote sustainable living environments, we partner with 

BCA to innovate, adopt and implement green design and construction 

technologies. We also work closely with HDB to develop sustainable 

homes.

Our environmental approach focuses on energy efficiency and carbon 

emission reduction from the buildings we construct, develop or manage.

Energy

Our energy consumption comprises grid electricity and diesel at our 

construction sites. We, therefore, focus on reducing energy intensity by 

minimising the use of electricity and diesel in construction to lower our 

footprint.

In 2019, the absolute electricity consumption at our construction sites 

was 827,756 kWh as against 1,504,841 kWh in the prior year. During 

the same period, our operations consumed 1,385,540 litres of diesel 

compared with 1,341,037 litres in the preceding year. In 2019, the total 

energy intensity was 0.384 GJ/m2 of gross floor area built against  

0.333 GJ/m2 in the previous year. Our target is to achieve energy  

intensity of 0.38 GJ/m2 or less.

We also track electricity consumption in our head office building, 

including the common area but excluding the tenants’ use. We measure 

and report the associated carbon emissions as well.

GHG Emissions

Carbon emission reduction is an essential aspect of our environmental 

initiatives. Our target is to reduce emissions intensity in our construction 

operations which accounts for most of our carbon footprint.

We monitor CO2 emissions from the use of electricity and diesel and 

regularly review our performance. 

The total CO2 emission from construction activities in 2019 was 4,025 

tonnes compared with 4,190 tonnes in 2018. Emissions intensity for the 

same period was 27.4 kgCO2/m2 and 24.4 kgCO2/ m2 respectively.

Our Energy Efficiency Programmes

Our construction sites have adopted the following energy saving 

initiatives: 

• 

Energy-efficient LED Lights;

• 

2-tick energy-saving air-conditioning units;

• 

Maintain air-conditioning temperatures at 25ºC;

• 

Reduce the number of power generators to reduce diesel 

consumption;

• 

Energy-saving office printers;

• 

Energy-saving awareness campaigns;

• 

Use of window blinds to minimise the heat from outside;

• 

Motion-detection sensors in toilets to switch on or off lights 

automatically; and

• 

Noise meter powered by solar panel.

Scope-1 and Scope-2 Emissions

We report Scope-1 direct emissions and Scope-2 indirect emissions 

resulting from diesel consumption and purchased electricity respectively, 

in line with the GHG Protocol and the GRI Standards. Our Scope-1 direct 

emissions from diesel refer to stationery combustion for power generation 

at construction sites.

Scope-1 direct emissions from diesel consumption accounted for 95% 

of our total CO2 emissions at construction sites in 2019. For the year, 

our diesel consumption intensity was 0.36 GJ/m2 of gross floor area 

constructed. Our target is to achieve diesel consumption intensity of  

0.35 GJ/m2 or less. 

Our Scope-2 emissions result from the use of purchased electricity.  

Our electricity consumption intensity in 2019 was the equivalent of  

0.02 GJ/m2 as against our ongoing target of 0.03 GJ/m2 or less. 

Building Materials 

Our approach is to use construction materials efficiently to minimise 

waste. We also strive to select materials which have a lower impact on  

the environment. For example, we use pre-cast concrete components 

which enhance productivity and reduce pollution at the construction site. 

We also use sustainable materials with the Singapore Green Label that 

meets the Green Mark criteria established by BCA.

Our materials use in the stated period is summarised below:

Sustainability Report 2019 17

Waste Management

Our construction operations primarily produce non-hazardous waste. 

As far as practical, we make efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle waste to 

minimise the amount sent for disposal. We dispose of waste through 

licensed contractors in accordance with the applicable regulations. 

In 2019, non-hazardous waste from our construction sites was 4,631 

tonnes as against 5,499 tonnes in the previous year.

Green Mark Features

We integrate several Green Mark elements in our projects and use 

products with Singapore Green Label to reduce the environmental impact. 

Examples of the green features and products used in our projects include 

recycling bins at the void deck area of residential blocks, covered bicycle 

parking lots, internal waterproofing, interlocking concrete pavers and 

paving material, earth retention &amp; slope protection material, subsurface 

drainage cells, calcium silicate board for false ceiling and protection of gas 

pipe, tile grout, concrete kerb, internal skin coat, aluminium composite 

panels, roof and gutter waterproofing, green-certified tile adhesive and 

polyurethane enamel paint system to steelworks.

Water Conservation

We use water in construction as well as in the properties that we manage. 

Our policy is to use water responsibly and implement conservation 

initiatives. 

At construction sites, our measures include collecting rainwater to reduce 

the demand for fresh water, as well as reusing and recycling water.  

A silty water treatment system installed at sites helps us prevent water 

contamination. We use pre-cast concrete components which have 

significantly reduced the need for the on-site use of water.  We use water-

efficient taps and fittings and dual flush closets that have a 3-tick rating by 

the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) to save water.

We monitor our water use and review our consumption regularly. In 2019, 

our water consumption at construction sites was 140,529 m3 as against 

184,741 m3 in 2018. For the same period, water intensity was measured 

to be 0.96 m3/m2 and 1.07 m3/m2 respectively. Our water intensity target 

for the construction business remains 0.9 m3/m2 or less.

Our Water Efficiency Programme

• 

Collecting rainwater to reduce the demand for fresh water, as 

well as reusing and recycling water at site;

• 

Rain water and recycled water treated before using to wash 

the area and discharge to public drains;

• 

Use of PUB certified taps with 3-tick rating;

• 

Closets with dual flush to increase water efficiency;

• 

Use of pre-cast concrete components which significantly 

reduces on-site use of water;

• 

Use only “Singapore Green Label” cleaning products in 

canteens; and

• 

Eco-friendly natural products for toilet cleaning.

Wastewater Management

Wastewater is generated at our construction sites. Our approach is to 

collect, treat and dispose of wastewater according to environmental 

regulations. We track our wastewater to find ways to minimise it. Our 

measures include prevention and control of water contamination from oil, 

chemical drums and bulk storage tanks.

We implement the required earth control measures to manage silty 

discharge due to rain. We reuse wastewater as well as rainwater to wash 

vehicles before they leave the construction site, which also keeps the 

roads clean.

Pollution Control

Our pollution control measures aim at reducing noise, dust and vibrations 

resulting from construction activity, vehicles, heavy equipment and 

machinery at construction sites. We follow regulatory guidelines and 

industry best practices for lowering pollution. We constantly monitor our 

construction works.

To keep the noise under permitted levels, we continuously monitor 

our construction operations and ensure regular maintenance of the 

equipment and machinery to reduce sound levels. Our use of pre-cast 

concrete components also helps in mitigating noise at our construction 

sites. We ensure that vibrations caused by piling and demolition do not 

exceed permitted limits.

Operations involving concrete, cement, wood, stone, and silica cause 

dust at construction sites. We use fine mesh screens to stop dust from 

dispersing. We also use water sprays to control dust pollution.

To minimise the impact on the surrounding communities, we engage with 

the affected groups to keep them informed of our impending construction 

schedules, and promptly address and resolve any pollution-related 

complaints from the public.

Regulatory Compliance

Complying with applicable laws is a top priority for the Group as 

non-compliance may result in penalties, stop-work order and loss of 

reputation. To ensure compliance, we regularly review environmental and 

public health regulations to update and implement the necessary policies 

and practices.

In 2019, at our construction business there was no incident of stop work 

order. However, there were 20 demerit points related to an incident where 

it was not reported timely and a notice of non-compliance in connection 

with Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act “WSH Act”. Out of the six construction 

work sites, there were no incidents of non-compliance at four work sites. 

Regrettably, there was an incident of lapse in vectors control and two 

offences at two worksites in connection with the WSH Act, these resulted 

in a total fine of $8,000.

 At our property development business, a total fine of $1,800 had resulted 

from an offence in fire safety violation. We have since taken corrective 

measures to prevent the recurrence of these problems.

Environmental Performance 

Performance data for our key environmental indicators are presented in 

the following sections. It may be noted that the amount of energy and 

water used, as well as the amount of waste and wastewater generated, 

depends on the construction phase of a project. The annual consumption 

trends may not be entirely comparable as power and water consumption 

tend to be higher during the middle stages of a project.

Investing in Our People

We consider people our most valuable asset. Our business growth and success depend on our 

ability to attract and retain talented people to deliver high-quality projects on time. We promote fair 

and inclusive employment and support the overall well-being of our people. At our construction 

business, ensuring safety at the workplace remains our foremost priority.

Employment

At end of FY2019, our Construction, Property Development and Education Divisions in Singapore 

employed 520 full-time permanent employees. There were 25 part-time employees, all were female. 

During the year, we hired 182 new employees. The average age of our employees is 40.8 years.

In addition, we employed 152 employees at Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore which is part of our 

hospitality business. 

We also employed 324 foreign construction workers who were on fixed-term contracts. The Ministry 

of Manpower (“MOM”) regulates the hiring of foreign construction workers in Singapore.

Diversity

We promote diversity and inclusive workplace culture. We are committed to promoting workplace 

diversity in terms of gender, age, experience and culture. Our workforce is represented by people 

from different backgrounds, nationalities and ethnicities. As an equal opportunity employer, our 

We are committed 

to promoting a 

workplace culture 

where our people  

can realise their  

full potential.

human resource policies encourage hiring, rewarding and promoting 

based on merit and performance.

Women accounted for 49.6% of our full-time employees and also held 

44.3% of supervisory and managerial positions. Among the new hires,  

the proportion of women was 67.8%.

Training

We provide opportunities for ongoing training and development to 

ensure our people have the right skills to perform their job effectively. 

Continuous learning is also crucial for retaining and developing talent to 

support our business growth.

In 2019, our employees attended training, workshops and conferences 

covering a wide range of topics spread throughout the year. Training 

topics included workplace safety, construction productivity, health and 

environmental management, sustainability reporting, quality and 

productivity, lean construction, best practices for green and gracious 

builders, earth control measures, construction regulations, service 

excellence, virtual design and construction, contract management, 

project management, child first aid, ethical business conduct, latest 

developments in construction law and personal data protection.

Talent Management

Our ability to hire and retain competent, qualified and skilled employees 

is vital for our business. We have adopted human resource policies that 

promote a professional working environment built on mutual respect  

and trust.

Employee Turnover

Our target is to maintain our employee turnover rate lower than the 

relevant national average. In 2019, our turnover rate for the construction, 

property development and corporate divisions in Singapore was 

16.5%, lower than the national construction industry average rate of 

21.6% (Source: Labour Market Survey 2019). Our turnover rate for the 

construction, property development and corporate divisions has  

remained lower than the national industry average for the past three 

consecutive years.

Our turnover rate for the education division, a new business line that 

started in August 2018, was 37.7%. The turnover rate for male and 

female employees was 16.0% and 41.1% respectively. By age group, 

the turnover rate was as follows: 55.9% for under 30 years, 29.2% for 

30-50 years, and 30.0% for employees aged above 50 years. Currently, 

there is no comparable national average benchmark available for the 

private education sector. Our goal is to improve the retention rate in our 

education division by taking the necessary measures.

Managing Performance

All of our permanent employees participate in performance appraisal 

twice a year. The performance appraisal exercise helps to evaluate the  

staff performance, determine training needs, close the performance gaps 

and develop career plans.

Employee Benefits and Welfare

To attract and retain talented employees, we provide competitive 

compensation, bonuses and performance-based wage increments. 

Our employees enjoy a variety of benefits. Our full-time permanent 

employees are entitled to annual leave, enhanced child care leave, 

marriage leave, medical and hospitalisation leave and compassionate 

leave. The insurance benefits comprise Group Health Insurance, travel 

insurance and Work Injury Compensation Insurance. Other staff welfare 

benefits include annual company dinner, recreation activities, festival 

gatherings, bereavement donations and wreaths and newborn baby gifts.

Upgrading Workforce Skills

We have implemented a programme to help Basic-Skilled foreign 

construction workers improve to the Higher-Skilled R1 category in 

accordance with the criteria set out by MOM. Investing in upgrading skills 

means higher productivity and a lower levy that we need to pay. Also, 

Higher-Skilled workers can be employed for an extended period of up to 

26 years instead of just 14 years for Basic-Skilled workers.

In 2019, 13 workers were successfully upgraded to the Higher-Skilled 

category. These workers received combined 319 hours of training in a 

variety of trades.

Promoting Workplace Safety and Health

The construction industry accounted for the largest share of fatal injuries 

of any industry in Singapore with 14 fatal injuries reported in 2018. With 

214 incidents, the Construction sector was also the highest contributor to 

workplace major injuries for the year, according to the Workplace Safety 

and Health Report 2018. 

Safety-first culture is part of our business model. Over the years, Chip Eng 

Seng has built a strong safety culture across all levels from the top-level 

management to the site supervisors and workers. 

Our target is to have zero workplace accidents. Our measures aim to 

reduce safety and health risks by encouraging continuous improvement 

through a variety of safety initiatives. We are focused on building a culture 

of safety across the Group. Our commitment is to maintain high safety 

standards to ensure a safe workplace for our workers, contractors and 

sub-contractors. 

We have implemented a comprehensive QEHS system to ensure quality, 

environment, safety and health requirements are met at each stage of 

construction. For each project, we conduct a thorough risk assessment to 

identify and mitigate safety hazards. We ensure compliance with safety 

regulations and align our work processes with industry standards for safe 

construction.

Our employees receive ongoing safety briefings and training to help them 

understand the safety risks inherent in various construction activities and 

to learn safe work practices.

Safety through Innovation

Our safety-first culture encourages innovation and continuously  

exploring new methods to lower the risk of injury at our work sites. As a 

result, our subsidiary Chip Eng Seng Contractors (1988) Pte Ltd developed 

a Z-Bracket, which is a lightweight steel hollow section with a pipe socket 

at one end. The smart design enables the leg of a scaffolding frame 

to be seamlessly slotted into the Z-Bracket. The principal advantage of 

this simple yet useful product is that it allows the scaffolding structure 

to be directly clamped onto the parapet wall, providing added stability 

and eliminating the need to set up extensive scaffolding at a building’s 

exterior.

Safety Performance

We regularly monitor and review the safety performance at our 

construction sites against key indicators. A summary of our safety 

performance is presented below.

Human Rights

Our workplace policies support the principles of human rights protected 

by national laws and internationally accepted conventions of the UN and 

the International Labour Organisation. Our policy bars discrimination, 

child labour and forced labour in our operations as well as the work 

performed by contractors and sub-contractors at our premises, factories, 

work and construction sites.

a) Non-discrimination: We prohibit discrimination in employment 

on any grounds, including gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, 

marital status, pregnancy and disability;

b) Child Labour: We prohibit child labour in our operations and 

expect our suppliers to ensure the same standards. We have 

determined that there is no risk of child labour in our construction 

business in Singapore;

c) Forced Labour: We prohibit forced labour in our operations and 

expect our suppliers to ensure the same standards; and

d) Freedom of Association and Right to Collective Bargaining: 

We respect our employees’ right to freedom of association and 

collective bargaining in accordance with local laws. Currently, Chip 

Eng Seng does not have a collective bargaining agreement with 

any union. Our employees, however, have the right and freedom 

to raise any matter of concern freely with their supervisors, the HR 

department or the senior management.

We hire foreign contract workers for our construction business from 

developing countries approved by MOM. We have implemented 

measures to protect their human rights during the hiring process, their 

stay in Singapore, and while they are at work on our project sites.

There were no incidences of non-compliance relating to discrimination, 

child labour, forced labour and freedom of association in the reported 

period.

Caring for Workers

We employed 324 foreign construction workers at the end of 2019. We 

hire foreign construction workers from source countries approved by 

MOM. The hiring of foreign construction workers in Singapore is strictly 

regulated by MOM. All foreign construction workers are also required to 

attend the Construction Safety Orientation Course or the Apply Workplace 

Safety and Health in Construction Sites training.

The welfare of our workers is an important issue for us. We provide clean 

housing facilities to our foreign workers in approved dormitories fitted 

with modern amenities. The facilities and services at the dormitories 

include dedicated cooking areas, laundry and recreational facilities such 

as gym and outdoor games courts. Welfare benefits also include free 

wireless internet access, televisions at the canteen and washing machines.

We provide transport facilities for workers to travel between their 

residence and the construction site. We have also provided spaces for 

parking bicycles.

To motivate workers, we offer monetary rewards and a certificate of 

appreciation to workers who perform exceptionally well during the month.

Quality and Safety

Over the decades, Chip Eng Seng has established a reputation for adopting high standards of quality 

and safety in construction and development projects. Driven by our passion for quality, we regularly 

invest in the most advanced and efficient construction technologies available. We continuously 

upgrade and maintain our equipment to enhance safety, performance and productivity.

Public housing is a substantial component of our construction business. Being a significant financial 

and emotional investment for homeowners, we understand the importance of ensuring high quality 

and workmanship. Delivering high-quality homes is also crucial for our reputation.

We also have a track record of completing all our projects ahead of schedule or within the target 

timeline. Among the many successfully executed prestigious projects, The Pinnacle@Duxton, 

the biggest and tallest public housing project in Singapore stands out. A 50-storey residential 

development in the city centre, The Pinnacle@Duxton features the world’s two longest sky gardens 

measuring 500 metres each, on the 26th and 50th floors.

Certifications

Our Group companies have obtained international certifications such as the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 

and OHSAS 18000 that reflect our commitment to quality, environmental stewardship and  

workplace safety.

We are committed to  

high standards of quality  

in construction and  

property development

Sustainability Report 2019 27

Green Construction

Working closely with HDB and BCA, we continue to embrace green 

building standards, principles and technologies in our projects. Our Group 

companies have won multiple awards for our environmental initiatives 

over the years, including the BCA Green and Gracious Builder Award - 

Excellent.

Quality and Safety Standards

We build our projects in strict compliance with building regulations 

and standards including but not limited to structural stability, materials, 

workmanship and safety. We employ qualified and experienced teams of 

architects, engineers and technical staff to ensure that each project meets 

our stringent norms of quality and safety.

We participate in the Construction Quality Assessment System 

(“CONQUAS”), the BCA-established industry benchmark for quality 

and workmanship standards of construction projects in Singapore. 

The CONQUAS assessment for two projects with HDB was successfully 

completed during the year. The two projects achieved an average 

CONQUAS score of 93.0, higher than our average scores for completed 

projects in 2017 (90.8) and 2016 (92.2).

Driving Safety Through Innovation

We continuously explore new systems to lower the risk of environmental, 

health and safety hazards involved in structural works activity. Out of the 

14 fatal accidents in the construction industry in Singapore in 2018, eight 

cases were due to fall from height and one was caused by falling objects 

from height. Workers are at potential risk of fall from height or getting 

struck by falling objects from height during erection and dismantling of 

aluminum formwork.

In 2019, our subsidiary CES Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd 

developed a new method of constructing staircase storey shelter 

mechanical ventilation shaft to address the safety hazards related to 

formwork. With the new innovative method, the construction can be done 

with a collapsible formwork system lifted by a tower crane.  Safety hazards 

from a potential fall from height and hit by falling object hazards are 

completely eliminated as installation and dismantling of intermediate 

platform and scaffold are not required and workers are also not required 

to work in confined spaces with this new method of constructing staircase 

storey shelter mechanical ventilation shaft.

Besides improving worker safety, the new method also significantly 

reduces the manpower requirement, increase productivity and overall 

lead to cost saving.

The innovation won a SCAL WSH Innovation Award for our Grandeur Park 

Residences project.

Suppliers and Sub-Contractors

Our supply chain mainly includes contractors and sub-contractors and 

vendors for building materials and supplies. We regularly engage with 

our contractors and sub-contractors to promote safe work practices 

through meetings, reviews, training and briefing sessions to help them 

achieve the required QEHS standards.

Our QEHS policies also cover our contractors and sub-contractors to ensure 

safety and compliance at our construction sites. We prefer contractors, 

sub-contractors and suppliers who have attained bizSAFE Level 3 

certification for workplace safety and health.

We review contractors' and sub-contractors’ QEHS performance every six 

months. To encourage excellence, we have also instituted annual awards 

to recognise contractors and sub-contractors for their QEHS performance.

Customer Safety

Health, safety and security of our tenants, customers and visitors at 

the buildings we manage is also a top priority for us. We have adopted 

policies and practices to ensure fire and elevator safety, access for people 

with disability, asset security, disaster management and emergency 

procedures.

In 2019, there were no incidents of non-compliance concerning the 

health and safety involving customers, tenants or visitors at properties in 

Singapore that we own and manage.

Sharing Best Practices

We welcome the opportunities to share our QEHS best practices with 

peers. In 2019, our construction business produced a video clip to 

showcase our strong safety and innovative culture during HDB Safety 

Seminar &amp; Award presentation held at HDB auditorium. Our workers also 

put up a skit performance on work safety during the presentation. We also 

rendered assistance to HDB by providing one of our construction sites and 

our workers for HDB’s production of a safety video titled, A Word in Time 

Saves Lives which was played during HDB's Safety Award presentation.

Data Privacy

The Group is committed to safeguarding personal data, including 

customers’ and employees’ personal information. We have implemented 

policies and measures to manage personal data in compliance with 

Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act.

In 2019, there were no incidents of breaches of customer privacy or loss  

of personal data.

Commitment to the Community

The Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) programmes aim to 

promote a sustainable living environment and improve the quality of life 

for our current and future generations. We believe it is essential for us to 

build a trusted relationship with the local communities by reaching out 

to the needy. Our CSR activities have also helped to forge a stronger bond 

amongst our employees, customers and beneficiaries. 

Through our community outreach, we support various social causes 

the arts, education, healthcare and the environment. We partner with 

Singapore’s construction community and non-profit organisations to 

support multiple philanthropic programmes through giving and fund-

raising efforts. Our employees also volunteer in a number of community 

initiatives. In total, the Group contributed $328,358 in sponsorships and 

donations to meaningful causes in 2019.

During the year, the Group partnered with several community groups 

for initiatives and programmes that focused on the environmental, 

culture and arts, education and healthcare in Singapore. Our sponsorship 

of various golf tournaments and events benefitted the NUS School of 

Design &amp; Environment Development Fund, Ren Ci Hospital, Compassion 

Fund Ltd, PAP Community Golf Tournament, the People’s Association 

Community Club Building Fund, the Singapore Scout Association, 

RHT Rajan Menon Foundation, and Braddell Heights CCC Community 

Development Welfare Fund. 

We actively supported a range of social causes through participation or 

sponsorship that included Roxy Foundation/ Community Foundation 

of Singapore Sharing and Caring for Families 2019, Montfort Care, 

Singapore Symphony Group and Singapore National Eye Centre Fund.  

We also teamed up with the Singapore Organisation of Seaman and 

Seacare Co-operative Ltd. to co-sponsor a Chinese New Year festive lunch 

for the senior citizens of Jalan Kukoh.

We continued to partner with Rainbow Centre in organising a work 

experience programme at Park Hotel Alexandra for youths aged 17 years 

and above to impart useful basic skills and knowledge to them.

During the year, our staff volunteers supported autism groups such 

as the Rainbow Centre by taking part in activities aimed at raising 

awareness of autism in the community. We also organised visits for 120 

of our employees to several of Siem Reap’s underprivileged families in 

Cambodia during the Group’s corporate retreat in the city. Our employees 

used this opportunity to donate essential items to the needy families, 

including pre-loved clothing contributed by our employees during a 

donation drive leading up to the corporate retreat. 

In 2019, the Group’s construction division provided $84,000 in aid 

to seven students under the BCA-Industry iBuildSG Undergraduate 

Scholarship and Sponsorship Programme. The programme helps bright 

students pursue full-time Built Environment courses at local universities 

and the BCA Academy.

Internship Programme

We offer internship opportunities to university and polytechnic students 

to help them gain practical working experience. In 2019, the construction 

division provided internships to two students while the education 

business unit enrolled one student intern. The internship duration ranged 

from 15.5 weeks to 30.5 weeks. 

We are committed to being a 

responsible corporate citizen.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption

Chip Eng Seng maintains a zero-tolerance position against bribery and 

corruption. Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption (“ABC”) Policy prohibits 

dishonest and fraudulent behaviour including offering, promising, 

authorising, providing or receiving any kickback. 

Our policy also requires all employees to comply with all applicable 

local anti-bribery laws where the Chip Eng Seng Group operates. For 

example, our policy requires compliance with the Singapore Prevention 

of Corruption Act, the UK Bribery Act, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

and the Australian Criminal Code Act.

All new employees are required to submit a conflict of interest declaration 

form upon joining and annually after that. Employees who participate in 

any tendering process or awarding of contracts are required to submit a 

positive declaration of any conflict of interest such as ‘nil’ declaration.

Whistle-blowing Policy

Chip Eng Seng’s Whistle-blowing Policy lays down procedures to 

empower employees and other parties to safely raise matters concerning 

corruption, bribery, misconduct, fraud, unethical or immoral behaviour 

or other wrongdoings without any fear of retaliation. The policy 

requires maintaining complete confidentiality of a complainant and an 

independent investigation of each case is carried out. 

The ABC policy, including the Whistle-blowing policy, is reviewed and 

endorsed by the Audit and Risk Committee. At the same time, the Human 

Resources Department is responsible for communicating the policy to all 

employees.

Our ABC policy provides for a stringent disciplinary action, including 

dismissal and referring the matter to the police against the individuals 

involved. 

There were zero incidents of bribery or corruption in the reported period.  

Socio-Economic Compliance

The Group is committed to compliance with applicable economic, 

labour and social laws and regulations including, but not limited to 

the requirements issued by MOM and BCA. The management regularly 

reviews and monitors our policies and practices concerning regulatory 

requirements. We disseminate regulatory updates to the relevant 

employees to help them stay up to date with legal requirements.

There were no incidents of significant fines in the reported period for non-

compliance with laws in the social, labour and economic area.

Suppliers 

Our commitment to green construction is a core aspect of our 

sustainability approach. We are continually looking out for new products 

and materials that are more energy efficient or have lower greenhouse 

gas emissions.

We strive to use environmentally sustainable materials certified under the 

Singapore Green Labelling Scheme. It is a pre-requisite for suppliers to 

meet the green product specifications before they get invited for tender or 

supply for our projects.
