related to corruption identified through risk assessment.  There were neither any confirmed incidents 

of corruption or public legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Group, nor any termination 

of contracts with business partners due to violations related to corruption. Moreover, the Group did 

not identify any material non-compliance with relevant anti-corruption laws and regulations. We aim

and reduces negative environmental impacts associated with each project. It considers environmental

Supplier Management 

The Group highly values our relationship with suppliers and contractors, and regard them as important 

business partners. Meanwhile, we also see the importance of recognizing the environmental and social 

risks embedded in the supply chain. Our major contractors include building contractors and 

consultants. The Group has implemented measures to ensure that our suppliers and contractors are 

informed of their environmental responsibilities.  

 

The Group has formulated comprehensive procedures in accessing and selecting suppliers and 

contractors. We evaluate our suppliers and contractors based on a number of factors, including their 

competence, environmentally friendly practices, technical capability, financial soundness, past 

performances and possession of relevant environmental certification such as ISO certification and BCA 

category of registration, and also take into consideration of their workplace health and safety records 

and compliance with laws and regulations. In addition, our contractors and suppliers must achieve and 

comply with the Green Mark Checklist launched by BCA, which prescribes environmentally sustainable 

measures. During FY2019, all new contractors were screened and none of them were assessed either 

for having environmental impacts or having a significant actual and potential negative environmental 

impacts  

 

The selection of the tenderers is conducted by the consultant, reviewed by the Development Manager, 

and approved by our CEO to ensure accountability and quality assurance of the suppliers and 

contractors chosen. After the selection of suppliers and contractors, we hold regular site meetings and 

track their workplace health and safety records to ensure that suppliers and contractors are 

performing within the standards expected by the Group.  

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

At SLB Development Ltd, we regard health and safety as a priority and see this as an essential part of 

our business. We strive to prioritise the health and safety of our employees, customers, third-party 

service providers and visitors. Maintaining a safe working environment at all of our facilities is essential 

to us. Therefore, we have set in place health and safety practices. 

 

The Group ensure that all contractors are notified of their worksite health and safety responsibilities 

during the tender selection process. The Group evaluates all buildings built, and implement the Design 

for Safety (“DFS”) review process for projects with construction works of a contract sum of $10 million 

or more. The purpose of DFS is to ensure the risks in the design of buildings are highlighted and 

managed in a systematic and coordinated way. The Group appoints DFS professional to assist in 

facilitation of the DFS review process, and to independently assess the design, construction and 

completion stages throughout the project to highlight any potential safety issues.  

 

During FY2019, the Group has complied with relevant laws and regulations concerning the health and 

safety at project sites, and there are no incidents of non-compliance with regulations resulting in fines, 

penalty, or warning. We aim to maintain this trend for the forthcoming year.
