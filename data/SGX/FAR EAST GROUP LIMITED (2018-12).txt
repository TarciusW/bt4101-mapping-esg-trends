Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

Board Statement 

Far East Group Limited (“Far East”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to publish 

our second sustainability report (the “Report”). Sustainability considerations are key to our long-term 

business strategy and we appreciate the opportunity to present our achievements and ambitions.  

The Board is responsible for the oversight of the sustainability agenda and strategy and has been involved 

in the determination of the material factors. The management has formed a sustainability council which 

works under the guidance of the Board to ensure that sustainability practices are executed across the 

different business units. With the assistance of the sustainability council, the Board has determined the 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors that are material for the continuity of the Group’s 

business. 

Our material factors have been categorised across three key segments: 

❖ Environment 

❖ People 

❖ Marketplace 

Environment 

The refrigeration and air conditioning industry can play a significant role in reducing its impact on the 

environment. The phasing out of harmful gases and development of energy efficient products are two areas 

which can yield mutual benefit to both our business and society at large, and the Group has been working 

tirelessly towards these objectives.  

People 

We recognise that our people are key drivers for our success. We place great emphasis in nurturing them 

by enhancing their training and development and taking care of their health and safety.  

Marketplace 

It is our responsibility to exceed expectations of our stakeholders in the market. We strive to do so by 

delivering high quality and safe products, maintaining financial stability and tackling the risk of cyber 

security through robust policies and measures.  

 

We would like to thank our staff for their hard work in contributing to this Report and another successful 

year for Far East Group Limited.

Materiality assessment 

Our materiality assessment was performed in line with the GRI reporting principles to identify the material 

factors relevant to the Group’s activities. We have collated feedback from stakeholders and reviewed 

sustainability factors identified by our peers to short-list potential material factors. We further engaged our 

employees through a survey to understand what areas they consider having the greatest impact on our 

environment, people and society. We have identified the following factors which are material to the Group, 

which have been prioritised and validated by the Board through the discussions with the management:

Governance of sustainability 

At Far East, we have established a sustainability council in order to oversee the development of the 

sustainability strategy, sustainability performance and monitoring, as well as the production of this Report. 

In consultation with our Board, the sustainability council organises information provided by operational 

teams in order to develop and evolve our sustainability strategy. The sustainability council is led by our 

Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and includes senior management executives from different teams including 

production and logistics, sales, and human resources, amongst others.

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

Environment 

Environmental compliance 

Why is it material 

The HVAC&amp;R industry can play a significant role in achieving the objectives of the Montreal Protocol (1987) 

which aims to protect human health and the environment by systematic phasing out of the production and 

consumption of ozone-depleting substances (“ODS”). Various other global and national commitments 

towards climate change are disrupting businesses across the industry value chain. We view these 

requirements as opportunities to evolve, and be innovative and adaptive to the changing demands of the 

market.  

Management approach 

We are constantly working towards the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) targets for phasing out 

ozone-depleting gases from our products. For example, we do not sell Chlorofluorocarbons (“CFCs”) 

refrigerants and have developed a phased plan to meet these requirements as per the regulations in the 

countries of our operations. 

In addition, whenever we perform a retrofitting due to a change in refrigerants, we advise customers to use 

recovery unit instead of letting out the gases into the environment. Furthermore, we actively participate in 

seminars and conferences to educate end-users on environmental concerns with refrigerants and the 

available alternatives in the market.   

We follow similar environmental compliance standards across other countries of operations. In our 

manufacturing facility in China, we do not allow spray painting and are mindful of local compliance 

requirements when we recover raw material and dispose of chemical products. 

Performance  

We have not had any non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations, and have not received 

any significant fines and/or non-monetary sanctions in FY2018.   

Targets 

We strive to meet our roadmap for phasing out of refrigerant gases and maintain zero environmental-

related fines in FY2019. 

 

Green products 

Why is it material 

The refrigeration and air-conditioning industry can create a significant impact on global energy 

consumption and emissions.  

Management approach 

Our approach is based on developing and distributing greener products, as well as creating awareness for 

our users on the potential benefits of transitioning to cleaner systems. 

With a long-term vision, we closely monitor global regulations so as to be prepared for the transition in the 

market. We are moving towards a greater mix of more energy efficient products with our in-house Green 

Programme, which is the centre of our innovation and product development strategy. For example, our CO2 

heat pumps are enabled with hot and cold recovery systems, where the excess heat can be used to heat water 

and the cold discharged water can be used to chill air-conditioning systems, unlike conventional systems 

which will discharge these into the environment.   


 

 

10 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

In addition, our product offerings combine different elements including equipment, controls and system 

designed to offer a comprehensive solution for improving energy performance and efficiency. Gradually, we 

will also be selling products that help to monitor the consumption of energy. 

We recognise that we can enhance our impact by spreading awareness and knowledge to our customers and 

the market. Within our service centre, we have an innovation centre where we display and promote high 

energy efficiency products. We also participate regularly at conferences to promote green products. 

Performance  

In FY2018, we conducted studies to lower wastage and redundancy of materials by performing the 

following: 

1. 

Combination and merging of product models 

We assessed the feasibility of combining some models of products while not eliminating the range 

of products nor compromising the quality of energy efficiencies of the products that we offer.  

Products which have close or similar capacities and performance are combined in our new G5 series 

heat-exchangers to offer customers easier selection options.   

 

2. Re-using transportation parts 

We have implemented a scheme where customers can return transportation parts (known as 

“mounting brackets”) for a refund of these parts. These mounting brackets help installers in 

reducing the need for excess work needed to invert the equipment and allows easy installation at 

customers’ sites thus reducing the wastage of energy or resource needed for installation. These 

brackets, when returned, are then re-used in the transportation of other products to other 

customers thereby reducing wastage and helping to save the environment. 

Targets 

We aim to continue improving the energy efficiency of our products and increase the number of energy 

efficient products as part of our product portfolio, as well as minimise wastage and redundancy in 

materials. 

 


 

 

11 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

People 

As a relatively small organisation operating in the distribution and manufacturing space, it is vital for us to 

maintain good succession planning and high retention of our staff. We strive to meet this objective by 

providing training development opportunities and ensuring safety of our employees at the workplace.

Human capital development  

Why is it material 

Human resource has been a rising concern in our industry over the last few years. This exposes our business 

to the risk of finding the right talent and ensuring a sound succession roadmap. High turnover rates can 

also lead to rising training costs and a decline in overall productivity and morale of the organisation.   

 

Management approach 

Attracting the right talent, nurturing their career growth and providing them with the right benefits and 

incentives are some actions that can create a more stable, equipped and inspired workforce.  

Training and development 

Training and development is a core focus of managing our human capital. Individual development plans 

comprising training needs are created for all employees at the department level, and are monitored as part 

of the annual appraisal cycle. Induction training is offered to all new employees and skills-based training is 

offered on a need basis. Some of the key trainings attended by employees during FY2018 include: 

- 

“Winning More Sales” Programme for all sales personnel; 

- 

SAP FI Module Training for the finance teams; 

- 

First Aid &amp; AED Training opened to all staff; 

- 

Training in operations of respective products for the technical and sales staff; and 

- 

Training in human resource hiring and analysis for the human resource department. 

Benefits and wellness 

We offer our employees with necessary health and insurance benefits. In addition, our employees have the 

provision for flexi-work which enables them to maintain a work-life balance. We like to celebrate our 

success together and hold annual dinners, company awards and sports events such as cycling.

Targets 

We aim to review our wellness and benefits programme, and align our human resource policies across the 

different entities in the Group in FY2019. 

 

Occupational health and safety  

Why is it material 

Given the nature of our operations, the health and safety of our staff, drivers and workers can be at risk. We 

strive to make sure that our efforts to mitigate this risk remain uncompromised. Not only is this a core part 

of our values, but any failure on our part can result in severe reputation damage to the Group.   

Management approach 

We abide by the highest standards in the industry and have recently obtained the OHSAS 18001 

(Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) certification on safety. All employees and workers go 

through the necessary safety trainings upon joining the Group. We also have a dedicated on-site safety 

officer along with an outsourced fire safety manager who conduct regular tool box meetings, and 

defibrillator and fire drills to ensure that all measures are in place. The safety officer conducts inspection 

checks of all equipment before use and keeps daily records to ensure maintenance is done and the 

equipment is safe to operate.  

Performance  

As a result of these measures, none of our employees and workers has had any recordable, high consequence 

or fatal injuries in FY2018. By changing certain manual processes, such as the manual drilling of holes in 

fins to automated ones, we have also lowered the staffs’ exposure to work injuries.  

Targets 

We plan to develop and roll out safety culture campaigns to advocate and educate our employees on best 

safety practices. 

 


 

 

14 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

Marketplace 

Product quality, health and safety 

Why is it material 

Maintaining the quality of our products is critical in the competitive industry that we operate in. Any issues 

regarding the functionality of our products or any harm to the health and safety of our customers on product 

usage can result in a significant customer loss.  

Management approach 

All our products go through stringent quality control procedures before reaching the market. We design 

and sell products that have adequate safety features, such as certified pressure vessels on our condensing 

units and systems to minimise risks to customer health and safety. Most of our products are covered by 

warranty to provide assurance to our customers on the quality of our products. 

Performance 

We have not had any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of our products in FY2018. 

In FY2018, we have improved the design of certain products by making changes to the heaters we use, 

thereby improving the durability of our products.   

Targets 

We will continue to incorporate and improve health and safety considerations in our products, and strive 

to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance in FY2019. 

 

Cyber security 

Why is it material 

We hold a large amount of data of our customers, distributors and suppliers. This data includes both 

confidential and personal information. Given the rising threat of cyber-attacks, this is an area of risk that 

we take very seriously. Any breach of our systems can result in reputation loss, as well as financial liabilities. 

Management approach 

We are guided by the Personal Data Protection Act in Singapore to protect the privacy of our customer data. 

Our data is stored in an ERP system which runs on a cloud server and is protected under network security 

which only our own employees can access. 

Performance 

We have not received any substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy in FY2018.  

We have proactively engaged a professional external party to conduct penetration tests to check the 

vulnerability of our IT systems to provide the management with an assessment of areas for improvement 

in terms of our IT hardware, software and systems.  This assessment is still currently in progress at the time 

of this Report’s publication. 

Targets  

We strive to continue being vigilant in our review of our risk exposure to cyber-attacks and taking the 

necessary steps to upkeep our system security.   

 


 

 

15 

Far East Group Limited Sustainability Report 2018 

Financial stability 

Why is it material 

Financial stability can be a risk to our business and if not managed adequately, it can impact the economic 

performance of the Group. If the economic value that we generate is sacrificed, it can adversely impact the 

payout to our stakeholders, including dividends to our investors, salaries to our employees, operating 

expenses to suppliers, taxes to government, and strategic investments to communities.  

Management approach 

We have a strong finance team monitoring the financial health of the Group closely. We do not have a fixed 

dividend policy which allows us to be more adaptive and less vulnerable to market changes. Our financial 

policies and procedures are reviewed regularly to keep up-to-date with risk management and control.  

Audits on the policies are performed by internal and external auditors who are independent and provide us 

with advice for continued improvement and safeguards.

by 3.5 times to approximately $35,000. We also worked with 2 charities, namely, Club Rainbow 

(Singapore) and Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital, and raised donations of $110,000 in total.   

Targets 

We aim to continue our efforts in our community investments.
