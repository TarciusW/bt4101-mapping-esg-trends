Highlights 

1.1 

Corporate Profile 

Interra Resources Limited (‘Interra’ or the ‘Company’), together with its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), are 

engaged in the business of petroleum exploration and production (E&amp;P). Our E&amp;P activities include 

petroleum production, field development and exploration. We are positioning ourselves to become a leading 

regional independent producer of petroleum. 

Since our inception, we have grown organically by developing our existing assets as well as through 

disciplined acquisitions by seeking attractive resource opportunities across Southeast Asia. Our portfolio of 

production, development and exploration assets comprises three petroleum contract areas in Indonesia and 

Myanmar. 

Interra is listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange. 

1.2 

Scope of Sustainability Report 

The scope of the report dated 26 March 2021 covers information on material sustainability aspects of 

Interra, namely the Group’s significant joint venture entity in Myanmar, Goldpetrol Joint Operating Company 

Inc. (Goldpetrol), from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 unless otherwise specified. This should 

sufficiently address stakeholders’ concerns in relation to sustainability issues arising from the major 

business operations of the Group. 

Interra owns 60% of Goldpetrol, which operates the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields in central Myanmar, 

under two Improved Petroleum Recovery Contracts (IPRCs) with the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise 

(MOGE). Interra manages the operatorship of both oil fields jointly with a joint-venture partner, China 

ZhenHua Oil Co., Ltd (ZhenHua Oil). The oil fields cover a total area of approximately 1,800 km2 and are 

located along the Ayeyarwaddy River, about 580 km north of Yangon. 

During financial year under review, the combined gross production for both oil fields was 970,513 barrels of 

oil (BO), comprising 100% of the total oil production by the Group. 

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core Option as it 

provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted as a global standard for sustainability 

reporting. It also considers the Sustainability Reporting Guide in Practice Note 7.6 of the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Manual. In preparing our report, we applied the GRI’s 

principles for defining report content and report quality by considering the Group’s activities, impacts and 

substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders. 

The data and information provided within the report have not been verified by an independent third party. 

We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy.

Message to Stakeholders 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Interra Resources Limited, I am pleased to present 

the Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (FY2020) 

Developing resources responsibly requires a collective effort. We must continue to operate in a safe and 

environmentally responsible manner and collaborate with communities in a mutually beneficial way. With 

more than 20 years of experience in developing Myanmar’s crude oil resources and cooperating with the 

MOGE, Interra’s long-term commitment to safe operations, minimised impact on the land, air and water, as 

well as investment in our communities remains strong. 

In the FY2020 sustainability report, we continue to report on the Group’s sustainability efforts on Sustainable 

Development, Environmental Stewardship, Health and Safety, and Community. The sustainability report 

highlights our business principles and approach, and how we are meeting the demand for energy in an 

economically, environmentally and socially responsible way. While we strive to make continual progress, 

there are always opportunities for improvement. We will also continue to track the key commitments for each 

area of our sustainability strategy in order to ensure that we have a robust sustainability programme in 

place. 

Interra will continue to stay responsible, mindful and ethical, while focusing on delivering results thereby 

positioning the Company for profitable and sustainable growth. During FY2020, despite restrictions brought on 

by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and negative economic conditions affecting the petroleum industry, we 

managed to complete three wells as oil producers before the suspension of our drilling programme in April 

2020. These early drilling successes, together with gains from the water-flood projects and aggressive 

production optimisation efforts, managed to arrest production decline and yield production gains. 

As 2020 comes to a close, we are still facing headwinds in these uncertain times. The potential for new 

lockdowns due to COVID-19 and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the return of global economic activity 

continue to be challenges in the coming year. Since February 2021, political unrest and the resulting civil 

disobedience movement in Myanmar have also resulted in the temporary suspension of our operations at 

the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields. As we continue to maintain regular communication with the relevant 

stakeholders in Myanmar so as to stay on top of the situation, we will put on hold capital expenditure and 

prioritise the safety of our employees as we tide over the current political turmoil. At this point, we are unable 

to ascertain the longer-term impact of this interruption on our business. The Company will closely monitor 

the evolving situation in Myanmar and provide updates as and when there are material developments. 

In the meantime, the Board will assess the operational disruptions and evaluate the financial impact on the 

Company. It will also review the earnings prospects and business strategy of the Company, seeking to 

mitigate the financial and operational exposure. Going forward, we will continue to exercise strict financial 

discipline through meticulous monitoring and review of the overall operating cost and budget. Our focus will 

be on curtailing all non-essential expenses and conserving cash. 

Lastly, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation. The Board has determined the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors 

and overseen the management in monitoring these material ESG factors. 

On behalf of the Board of Directors

Our Approach to Sustainability 

2.1 

Sustainability Organisational Structure 

Sustainability is a vital part of our corporate strategy for achieving long-term growth. The values we create 

for our people, the environment and society at large very much influence our financial performance. In order 

to better accommodate our sustainability goals and values, we have developed a sustainability 

organisational structure to move things forward. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board of Directors  

and Management 

Country Manager 

Employees 

The Board of Directors establishes the sustainability while the 

Management sees through the implementation of the framework. 

The Country Manager, together with the Corporate Social 

Responsibility (CSR) Coordinator, is charged with organising and 

coordinating the CSR work of all departments within the subsidiary. 

Relevant head of various departments are responsible for the 

implementation of CSR works.

2.2 

Sustainability Strategy 

At the Group, our sustainability strategy aims to create integrated values. Not only do we create economic 

value by maximising profits and shareholder value, but we also take on a broader responsibility as a global 

corporate citizen to create societal values. We commit to deliver value to all our stakeholders. 

As we look back on our progress over the last year, our efforts to deliver value to all our stakeholders can be 

summarised as follows: 

 

 

 

The sustainable strategy is underpinned by: 

(i) Policies and guidelines 

Including our Employee Handbook which establishes a clear tone at the top with regards to employees’ 

business and ethical conduct (including declaration of conflicts of interest); and 

(ii) Management systems 

Including our Environment Management Plan (EMP) which helps us align to best practices for managing 

environmental risks associated with crude oil extraction. The EMP has been in place at our Myanmar 

operations since FY2014. 

Our sustainability strategy is guided by a variety of external sources, including the GRI Standards and 

Sustainability Reporting Guide set out in Practice Note 7.6 of the SGX-ST) Listing Manual. 

The rest of this report covers our progress and performance against each of these areas, and the impact we 

have on the economy, environment and society as a result.

2.3 

Consulting Our Stakeholders 

We engage both internal and external stakeholders on a regular basis with the goal of strengthening our 

sustainability approach and performance. We listen to their expectations – and views on how well we are 

meeting them – as well as collaborating with them for deeper insights and mutual benefits.  

Through our stakeholder engagement processes, we gather both qualitative and quantitative input, which 

are essential in forming both our strategic direction and our day-to-day performance, and maximising the 

value of our contributions across all groups.  

In mapping our stakeholders, we have identified those to whom we have legal, commercial or moral 

responsibility – such as our regulators, suppliers and the communities around our operational areas. The 

other equally important groups – because we depend on them to operate – are our people and our business 

partners. 

An overview of our approach and rationale is set out below (with stakeholders listed in alphabetical order)

Sustainability Materiality 

Based on the stakeholder engagement, we developed our sustainability materiality matrix containing 

material aspects which are aligned with our principal business and operational risks, and formed our 

sustainability strategy which has shaped our approach to sustainability reporting, as illustrated in the 

diagram below. 

We will review and adjust the matrix each year as the external and business context changes. 

The aspect boundaries ‘within’ the organisation are limited to Goldpetrol, whereas the aspect boundaries 

‘outside’ the organisation include business partners, community, customers, employees, regulators, 

shareholders and investors, and suppliers.

Our Performance 

3.1 

How We Measure Our Performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams for 

each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programmes have advanced through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our 

sustainability strategy. Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure 

alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability programme in place, we have included the key commitments for 

each area of our sustainability strategy. The progress we have made against each key commitment is 

indicated using the symbols shown in the table below. 

We track and review our sustainability programme with the Board of Directors at least once a year.

3.2 

Sustainable Development 

Overview 

Since 1997, we have been operating the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields in central Myanmar, and 

cooperating with the MOGE. Armed with robust drilling and development plans as well as investments in 

new technologies, Goldpetrol is well-positioned to deliver sustainable development for the Group for the 

future. 

Long-term plans 

In FY2017, Goldpetrol was successfully awarded an 11-year extension of the IPRCs for the Chauk and 

Yenangyaung oil fields. In addition, Interra entered into a conditional subscription agreement with North 

Petroleum International Company Limited (NPI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZhenHua Oil, for the 

subscription of 79.5 million new ordinary shares in the capital of Interra by way of a private placement, which 

was completed on 30 January 2019. 

In light of these new developments, together with lessons learnt from the Group’s cost and operational 

control strategies in previous years, Goldpetrol is well-positioned to leverage on the strategic partnership 

between Interra and ZhenHua Oil, and put in place the investment and development planned for the oil fields 

and increase production output in the years ahead. 

Managing continual improvement 

During the year under review, Goldpetrol’s FY2020 drilling programme was suspended since April 2020 as a 

result of the negative economic conditions affecting the petroleum industry. As such, the Company was only 

able to complete three wells as oil producers before the suspension of the drilling programme, one of which 

commenced drilling in 2019. All three completed wells were in the Chauk field, with initial production rates 

totalling 128 BO per day. Although only three wells were completed as oil producers, these early drilling 

successes, together with gains from the water-flood projects and aggressive production optimisation efforts, 

managed to arrest production decline and yield production gains. 

As part of the strategy, Goldpetrol has committed to improve oil production progressively over the new 

contract period ending in 2028. As a result of our drilling efforts combined with effective field operations and 

production management, oil production for FY2020 was 15.8% higher compared to the FY2017 baseline. 

The on-going production enhancement by workovers, re-activations and new perforations in existing wells, 

all aimed at arresting the natural production decline, have also been very successful at increasing wellhead 

production and yielding appreciable gains. 

With regards to the water-flood programme which commenced in March 2018, Goldpetrol has been 

progressively implementing new projects at both fields with the aim of optimising oil production through 

targeted water injection strategies in individual fault block compartments. Five new projects were put into 

operation in FY2019, bringing the total to ten active water-flood projects of various sizes and objectives. 

There has been an overall noticeable oil gain and positive effects on the arrest of natural production decline 

in most targeted fault compartments. Since water-flooding by its nature is a long-term process, some blocks 

may not have realised the full effects yet.

Identification of new technologies 

In February 2018, Goldpetrol completed the acquisition of eleven patent rights from Chengdu North 

Petroleum Exploration &amp; Development Technology Co., Ltd (CNPED), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

ZhenHua Oil. The patents will be utilised to enhance oil production in the Chauk and Yenangyaung fields 

using enhanced oil recovery methods and other technologies. By adopting the patents in Myanmar, 

Goldpetrol is introducing new technologies to the Myanmar oil and gas industry which will benefit the 

industry in general. 

Goldpetrol has begun testing other processes, for example, the effects of high energy gas fracturing in 

known reservoirs. Also, capital was spent on upgrading Goldpetrol’s own ZJ 450 rig to allow for directional 

drilling of intermediate depth wells, which has heretofore required the use of a hired rig with significantly 

higher costs.

3.3 

Environmental Stewardship 

Overview 

Goldpetrol is committed to operating in an environmentally responsible manner to develop Myanmar’s crude 

oil reserves and resources. We seek to reduce our impact on wildlife, land, air and water at our operations 

through our commitment to our EMP and adherence to government regulations. 

In FY2020, we had no spills and no regulatory compliance incidents in Myanmar, demonstrating the benefit 

of integrating environmental initiatives into our business plans and strategies. We are mindful of the 

environment in which we operate and we strive to minimise our impact.  

Managing greenhouse gas emissions 

The risks associated with climate change are real and warrant action. Increasing carbon emissions in the 

atmosphere are having a warming effect. There is broad scientific and policy consensus that actions must 

be taken to further quantify and assess the risks. 

Goldpetrol has the same concerns as people everywhere – how to provide the world with the energy it 

needs while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are committed to positive action on climate 

change and dedicated to reducing the risk in the most efficient way for society by reducing GHG emissions 

in our operations. 

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from Goldpetrol and then calculate its total 

annual GHG emissions. 

In FY2020, Goldpetrol generated a carbon footprint 

of 12,616.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission 

(tCO2e) with a carbon emission intensity of 13.0 

kilograms of carbon dioxide emission (kgCO2e) per 

barrel of oil production. The emission mainly arises 

from purchased electricity which accounted for 

80% of the total carbon emission of Goldpetrol. 

We 

follow 

the 

Greenhouse 

Gas 

Protocol 

established by the World Resources Institute and 

the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for measuring 

corporate greenhouse gas emissions. 

Using the “control method”, we include 100% of the 

emissions associated with businesses which we 

directly control. Our carbon footprint includes: 

 

All fuels used directly by our companies 

(Scope 1 emissions) 

 

All purchased electricity used in our facilities 

(Scope 2 emissions) 

 

Impact of business air travel (optional Scope 3 emissions) 

Carbon footprint per barrel of oil production in FY2020 decreased when compared to the previous year as a 

result of decreased drilling activities due to the suspension of drilling programme. Energy consumption is 

expected to increase in tandem with the drilling campaign and accelerated field activities. 

As part of our strategy, Goldpetrol has committed to maintain the carbon footprint per barrel of oil production 

(from FY2018 baseline) over the new contract period ending 2028.

Energy efficiency 

Energy consumed in our operations generates 99.8% of our GHG emissions and is one of our largest 

operating costs. As such, energy efficiency presents a tremendous opportunity to make an impact on both 

the environment and our bottom line by reducing emissions, lowering costs and improving competitiveness.  

Our energy consumption comprises the following: 

 

Electricity consumption arising from operations of our offices and oil pump; and 

 

Diesel consumption from operations of motor vehicles. 

Whilst we take measures to reduce energy consumption through regular maintenance of our machinery, 

energy consumption is expected to increase in tandem with the drilling campaign and accelerated field 

activities. 

Water use 

Given that our operations are situated along the Ayeyarwaddy River in central Myanmar, we are always 

focused on freshwater conservation opportunities and the efficient use of water through the design, 

operation and expansion of our facilities. 

In the past, water extracted together with crude oil production (formation water) through primary recovery 

method was routed for sedimentation at the treatment pits before being discharged into the river. Since 

2016, we have been using the gravity injection of water in our oil fields to both increase oil production in 

offset wells and properly dispose of formation water. The ultimate goal is to reach zero discharge of water 

produced into the surrounding environment. 

With the implementation of the water-flood project in FY2018, the requirement for increased access to water 

supply for injection has been met by the use of recycled formation water supplemented by pumped river 

water. In smaller water-flood project areas where river water as a source is impractical because of the 

distance from the river, water from existing non-oil producing wells is employed. 

Land and waste management and biodiversity 

Minimising our impact to land and biodiversity is a key consideration throughout all life stages of our 

operations, from exploration, drilling and production, to responsible waste management, site reclamation 

and closure. We continue to develop and employ best practices and technologies to reduce our surface 

footprint and environmental impacts.

Health and Safety 

Overview 

Safety is a core value in every aspect of Goldpetrol’s operations. Ensuring the safety of the people who work 

in or live near our operational areas is our number one priority. 

In FY2020, we achieved an incident frequency rate of zero. 

Operational safety 

We continue to make progress on our commitment to achieve a safe and secure workplace through a strong 

focus on leadership behaviour, workforce engagement, risk management and consistent application of our 

EMP, which has been in place at our Myanmar operations since FY2014. 

The EMP is a comprehensive framework with a common set of expectations that embodies our commitment 

to managing personnel and process safety as well as operational and environmental risks inherent in our 

business. 

In FY2020, key focus areas included: 

 

Training and prevention programmes, including safety leadership, risk tolerance and approaching others 

 

Risk management with active processes to facilitate mitigation of key residual risks and prevention of 

significant events 

While we manage our business with the goal of preventing incidents, we are prepared for emergencies and 

can respond quickly, effectively, and with care to emergencies or incidents resulting from our operations. In 

the event of an incident, locally-trained personnel are supported by a response team from MOGE to control 

the situation, minimise impacts and restore operations in as short a time as possible. 

As part of our strategy to ensure safety in our operations, Goldpetrol has committed to limit overtime hours 

per employee to a maximum of 120 hours on an ongoing basis. In FY2020, Goldpetrol clocked 191 overtime 

hours per employee. This is due to reassignment of work schedule, replacement of affected staff due to 

quarantined and COVID-19 positive staff to cope with the production activities at the Chauk and 

Yenangyaung fields, despite lesser drilling activities. In addition, there were more public holidays declared in 

Myanmar for FY2020 as compared to FY2019. 

Although this is in excess of 120 hours per employee as indicated in our targets, the safety of our operations 

was not compromised in any case. All field operations staff are required to have a full 8 hours of rest before 

commencing their work shifts. 

Knowledge transfer and sharing 

Together with our joint venture partner, we periodically conduct short-courses and on-the-job training for our 

workers to ensure that they are well-equipped to manage new and emerging oil production processes that 

are currently being put in place. 

Some of the topics covered include: 

 

Drilling and workover operations 

 

Gas and oil collecting station management 

 

Mud engineering 

 

Cooling oil circulation and dewaxing processes 

 

Pumping unit maintenance 

 

Emergency handling of chemical release/spill 

 

Environment awareness 

 

Fire safety 

 

Chemical handling 

 

Waste disposal and segregation 

In view of COVID-19 restrictions, no work-related training was conducted in FY2020. Focus during the year 

was to implement measures to deal with the rapidly evolving regulatory requirements relating to COVID-19 

pandemic. These included activating business continuity plans, implementing workplace protocols to comply 

with personal protection and safe distancing measures, expanding digital workplace and telecommuting 

resources, educating employees on precautionary measures and sanitation practices, and introducing new 

health and travel policies. 

As part of our strategy to ensure safety in our operations, Goldpetrol has committed to achieve a minimum 

of 40 hours of training per employee on an ongoing basis. Previously, we achieved 40 training hours per 

employee, as part of an ongoing training for existing employees to refresh their working knowledge.

Business continuity 

The COVID-19 global pandemic presented various unprecedented challenges to our operations. However, 

we have adapted well to those restrictions of safe distancing and working from home, with relatively little 

disruptions to our operations in FY2020. We have initiated business continuity planning in Singapore and 

Myanmar to protect our staff and mitigate the impact on the Group’s business operations as follows: 

 

Brief employees on good personal hygiene measures as advised by the local health ministries. 

 

Enhanced screening procedures for visitors, including completion of a health screening and declaration 

form, to let them declare they have travel history to affected regions in the last 14 days and/or contact 

history with infected persons in the last 14 days. 

 

Carry out symptom or temperature monitoring of employees twice daily. If an employee is identified to 

have fever (37.5ºC and above), he/she will be advised to seek immediate medical assessment. 

 

Set up alternate teams of employees (i.e. Team A &amp; Team B) who can be deployed at different work 

schedules (e.g. Team A working in the office on alternate days, while Team B telecommutes and vice 

versa). The teams will be physically segregated to avoid the risk of infection between teams. 

 

Establish covering arrangements to minimise disruptions. 

We will monitor the local situation and will put in place the above practices and any additional controls as 

required by the local governments (e.g. quarantine measures, stop work orders) where applicable. In the 

meantime, we will continue to be vigilant in disease prevention and have communicated good personal 

hygiene measures to our office and field operations staff to ensure the continuity of our business operations. 

Political situation in Myanmar 

The Myanmar military removed the elected government on 1 February 2021, resulting in mass protests 

across the country. As announced on 9 February 2021, we have temporarily suspended our operations at 

the Chauk and Yenangyaung oil fields due to disruptions brought about by the civil disobedience movement.  

The political turmoil in Myanmar may lead to greater political instability and the potential for renewed 

international sanctions. As such, we will continue to maintain regular communication with the relevant 

stakeholders in Myanmar so as to stay on top of the situation. In the meantime, we will put on hold capital 

expenditure and prioritise the safety of our employees. 

At this point, we are unable to ascertain the longer-term impact of this interruption on our business. The 

Company will closely monitor the evolving situation in Myanmar and provide updates as and when there are 

material developments.

Community 

Overview 

Goldpetrol has long been a part of the community which we operate in. We offer financial and volunteer 

support to MOGE-organised community outreach exercises in Chauk and Yenangyaung each year, and we 

are actively engaged in community services. 

Community involvement 

Our giving and community engagement is guided by our main areas of focus, which include: 

 

Education and sports 

 

Healthcare 

 

Basic infrastructure building and maintenance 

 

Indigenous capacity and community building 

As part of our strategy to give back to the community, Goldpetrol has committed to invest at least 

US$100,000 towards community development on an ongoing basis. In FY2020, Goldpetrol invested about 

US$111,000 in the Chauk and Yenangyaung communities, providing much needed personal protective 

equipment (i.e. masks and medical supplies) to local hospitals to support their fight against COVID-19. 

Stakeholder engagement 

While the government grants the permit for development, the community provides crucial support towards 

our operations. Our stakeholders offer a variety of perspectives on energy development. Engaging in regular 

discussions with these parties is crucial to responsible operations. 

Goldpetrol’s operations and development opportunities are located within local communities. We support 

communities in areas where we explore, develop and operate, and strive to establish lasting relationships 

built on mutual trust and respect. 

Others 

We also seek to create long-term economic and social benefits for our communities, including workforce and 

supplier development. Enhancing education, developing a skilled workforce, creating jobs and supporting a 

reliable local supply network drive both economic growth and a higher standard of living. 

Workforce 

We seek to attract and retain employees interested in a long-term career with the company. Our Standards 

of Business Conduct govern all aspects of our employment and support our commitment to provide equal 

employment opportunities, prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace and align with applicable 

laws and regulations. 

Supplier development 

All of our suppliers and contractors must adhere to our requirements regarding safety, health, security and 

the environment, as well as the principles of our Standards of Business Conduct. We are also focused on 

developing local indigenous businesses through regular meetings with them to ensure they are aware of the 

opportunities created by our projects and understand our requirements.
