Board Statement

Overview of Sustainability at F&amp;N

The Board is pleased to present the Fraser and Neave,  

Limited (“F&amp;N” or the “Group”) Sustainability Report 

(‘Report’) covering the period from 1 October 2019 to  

30 September 2020. This Report is prepared in accordance 

with the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards (Core) which is in compliance with the 

Singapore Exchange’s (“SGX”) Listing Rules 711A and 711B. 

The Report encapsulates the Group’s overarching approach 

to sustainability. In this Report, we share how the Group 

integrates key Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

issues in its strategies, how the Group manages impacts 

and risks associated with these issues as well as its progress 

towards its 2020 sustainability targets.

Sustainability Governance

The Board has overall responsibility for sustainability and 

incorporates ESG issues in the formulation of F&amp;N’s strategy. 

While it takes the lead in the Group’s sustainability direction, 

the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (“SRMC”) 

is responsible for steering the Group’s sustainability efforts. 

The SRMC is supported by the Sustainability Development 

Committee (“SDC”), which is chaired by Mr Lee Meng Tat,  

Chief Executive Officer, Non-Alcoholic Beverages and 

comprises business Chief Executive Officers and senior 

executives across various functions. The SDC supports the 

SRMC and monitors the progress of the Group’s sustainability 

priorities.

Materiality Assessment 2020

In 2017, based on the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide,  

we conducted our first materiality assessment and  

determined F&amp;N’s materiality matrix and 2020 targets.  

The 2017 materiality matrix and 2020 sustainability targets 

were measured, reviewed and where necessary, refined 

annually to ensure they reflected changes to the sustainability 

landscape. As F&amp;N approached the end of our three-year 2020 

targets, the Group is looking to refresh the materiality matrix 

and set new sustainability targets for 2025. 

F&amp;N has conducted a materiality assessment exercise in 

2020 to determine the 2021 materiality matrix and 2025 

sustainability targets for the next phase of our sustainability 

journey starting 1 October 2020. An initial list of ESG 

topics has been identified and benchmarked against peer 

organisations and external trends analysis. We have expanded 

the exercise this year by also seeking inputs from external 

stakeholders, in addition to our internal stakeholders.  

These inputs were considered and integrated in the decision-

making process of determining the new key material topics 

for F&amp;N. F&amp;N’s 2021 materiality matrix and 2025 sustainability 

targets were finalised and approved by the SRMC in 

September 2020. F&amp;N will share more details in the next  

issue of the F&amp;N Sustainability Report. 

COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives and created 

unprecedented challenges for businesses worldwide.  

Business interruption arising from supply chain disruption, 

temporary closures of manufacturing plants, reduced 

personnel, etc. has tested the quality of business continuity 

framework, policies and procedures. During the course of 

this year, F&amp;N has adapted and implemented a COVID-19 

business continuity plan (“BCP”) to ensure that we have 

appropriate systems and procedures in place within the Group 

to specifically address the impact of the pandemic on business 

operational risks. 

At F&amp;N, protecting the health and safety of our workforce 

has always been the top priority. As we navigate these 

unprecedented times, we continue to take steps to 

communicate with our staff and connect them with resources 

that support their health and well-being. We continue to 

actively address evolving issues and provide guidance to  

our staff consistent with local government regulations.  

Social distancing measures at the workplace, staggered work 

hours, mandatory mask wearing, team segregation of work 

and telecommuting are some of the measures we have put in 

place to keep F&amp;N employees safe.

The Group continues to work collaboratively with suppliers, 

partners and customers to manage our supply chain so as to 

maintain healthy inventory levels. Continued availability of 

our core products to our customers during these trying times, 

through the use of e-commerce platforms, has also reduced 

the likelihood of disruptions to the business operations.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide support to the less 

fortunate in our local communities, and show our appreciation 

to the frontline heroes, F&amp;N has donated products to keep 

them hydrated and energised during this difficult time.

Looking At 2020 And Beyond

We are proud of our commitment to sustainability and of 

the work we have done across our businesses. While we 

have achieved some success in certain areas, there is more 

for us to do to transform F&amp;N, sustainably. As one of the 

leading consumer groups in Singapore and the region, we will 

continue to anchor sustainability in the Group and advance 

further toward a business model based on the principles of 

circular economy.

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020




Message from Chairman of SDC

GRI 102-14, GRI 102-15

FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index 

(“F4GBM”)

Our subsidiary, Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings 

Bhd (“F&amp;NHB”), has been included  

as a constituent of the F4GBM with 

positive results. For the second year,  

the performance of our strong ESG 

practices have been recognised by 

the Index. Our improved ESG ratings 

from last year is a testament to our 

positive strides in delivering value to our 

stakeholders in an environmentally and 

socially responsible manner.

Progress on 2020 sustainability 

targets

Guided by F&amp;N’s 2020 sustainability 

targets, we have continued to track and 

report our annual performance since 

2017. In 2020, the Group has achieved 

50% of its 10 key sustainability targets, 

with certain areas requiring further 

efforts and adaptations due to the 

COVID-19 circumstances and operational 

changes (e.g. new production lines, 

new operational processes, product 

requirement and internal stringent health 

and safety demands). The respective 

sections of the report dealing with 

these material topics provide further 

explanations.

 

OVERVIEW OF 2020 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

At F&amp;N, sustainability is a key business 

driver and a critical component of our 

success. F&amp;N’s vision is to be a stable 

and sustainable F&amp;B leader in the ASEAN 

region. Our 2020 Sustainability Report 

demonstrates our constant commitment 

to incorporate sustainable practices into 

our business and show leadership with 

the sustainability challenges faced. 

This report has been prepared in 

accordance with the GRI Standards 

(Core), which represent global best 

practice in sustainability reporting.  

By adhering to GRI Standards, F&amp;N 

aims to communicate our performance 

against our sustainability targets and 

demonstrate our progress over time. 

F&amp;N’s data collection processes are 

aligned and integrated with Thai 

Beverage Public Company Limited’s 

(“ThaiBev”) reporting parameters.

ThaiBev has been a member of the 

Dow Jones Sustainability Index (“DJSI”) 

World and DJSI Emerging Markets since 

2016, and their constant progress to 

integrate sustainability across their value 

chain has earned the company the 

title of Beverages Industry leader in the 

RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability 

Assessment from 2018 to 2020. 

With a systematic approach to 

sustainability reporting, F&amp;N aims to 

provide consistent information disclosure 

and benchmark our performance against 

industry leaders to improve through best 

practice sharing and knowledge transfer.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROGRESS 

IN 2020

External Assurance

For the second consecutive year, Lloyd’s 

Register Quality Assurance (“LRQA”) 

has conducted an external assurance 

on selected F&amp;N Health, Safety and 

Environment (“HSE”) disclosures.  

This external assurance serves to 

demonstrate the accuracy of the 

sustainability data disclosed in this report. 

 LRQA’s assurance statement can be found 

on page 98 of this report. 

F&amp;N’s commitment to reduce 

packaging material and waste 

continues to be an important 

priority and is an integral part of the 

Group’s Circular Economy approach.  

To reduce our environmental 

impacts, we design and develop 

new packaging solutions to ensure 

that they can be recycled, reused or 

composted.

Message from Chairman of SDC

While F&amp;N has made good progress in 

some areas, we still need to do more for 

the other targets. We remain committed 

to exploring and implementing new 

initiatives to achieve our 2025 targets.

 Each of the Group’s commitments and 

target achievements are described in detail 

on pages 29 to 31 of this report.

Highlights of key initiatives

Healthier products for consumers

At F&amp;N, we place Consumer Health and 

Safety at the core of our sustainability 

strategy and have been continuously 

innovating our products with our 

consumer’s health and safety in mind.  

This year, we launched healthy drinks such 

as the F&amp;N NUTRISOY Fresh Soya Milk  

with Real Oats &amp; Quinoa which helps to 

boost our consumers’ immune system.  

To encourage reduced sugar intake, 

&gt;35% of our RTD products sold today 

in Singapore and Malaysia contain less 

than 5g of sugar per 100ml and do not 

compromise on taste. 

 More information on innovative products 

encouraging good health and safety for 

our consumers can be located on page 36 

of this report.

Recyclable packaging

F&amp;N’s commitment to reduce packaging 

material and waste continues to be an 

important priority and is an integral 

part of the Group’s Circular Economy 

approach. To reduce our environmental 

impacts, we design and develop new 

packaging solutions to ensure that they 

can be recycled, reused or composted. 

The Group is on track to meet its goal 

to have 100% recyclable beverage 

packaging by 2021. In 2020, F&amp;N rolled 

out a new packaging solution for our 

F&amp;N ICE MOUNTAIN Drinking Water. 

In addition to bottles, consumers now 

have the extra option of purchasing our 

F&amp;N ICE MOUNTAIN Drinking Water in 

an eco-friendly recyclable paper carton 

packaging.

Recycle N Save

Recycle N Save is a joint initiative by F&amp;N 

and the National Environment Agency 

(“NEA”) of Singapore to place Smart 

Reverse Vending Machines (“RVMs”) 

across Singapore. This joint initiative aims 

to encourage recycling of used plastic 

drink bottles and aluminium drink cans 

amongst Singaporeans and supports 

the national vision of the Sustainable 

Singapore Blueprint’s goal to increase the 

national recycling rate to 70% by 2030. 

Launched in October 2019, at Our 

Tampines Hub in Singapore, Mr Masagos 

Zulkifli, the then Singapore Minister of 

Environment and Water Resources, was 

the Guest-of-Honour. He along with  

Mr Tan Meng Dui, Chief Executive Officer 

of NEA, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Group Chief 

Executive Officer, National Trades Union 

Congress (“NTUC”) Fairprice Group,  

Mr Suhaimi Rafdi, Director of Our 

Tampines Hub, and Ms Jennifer See, 

Managing Director, Singapore and Yoke 

Food Industries Malaysia, F&amp;N Foods 

Singapore (“FNFS”), commenced this 

initiative. Phase 1 of the launch saw 10 

Smart RVMs being installed nationwide, 

with support from our trade partner, 

NTUC Fairprice. Public could drop in 

their used and empty aluminium drink 

cans and plastic bottles in exchange for 

discount vouchers at NTUC.

This year, together with four new partners, 

CapitaLand Malls, Sport Singapore, 

Sentosa Development Corporation and 

Anywheel, we installed 50 Smart RVMs 

island wide. Placed in shopping centres 

06

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


across the island, the public can choose 

from a wider range of rewards when they 

deposit used and empty drink cans and 

plastic bottles. Since the launch of Recycle 

N Save in 2019, over 3.1 million plastic 

beverage bottles and aluminium cans have 

been collected.

 

The RVM School Education Programme, 

under the Recycle N Save initiative,  

was also launched in March 2020.  

In the first run, five RVMs were placed 

in primary and secondary schools for 

a six-month period. Students were 

encouraged to proactively collect empty 

plastic drink bottles and aluminium drink 

cans, and deposit them into the RVMs 

located at their schools. The schools had 

also organised their own environmental 

education activities to tie in with the 

placement of these RVMs.

Reduction of packaging waste

Earlier in 2020, Times Printers (“TP”) 

also started to make use of balanced 

web paper as packaging material for 

wrapping books. This has resulted in a 

reduction of the quantity of paper waste 

in our printing operations.

Contributions to the Community

F&amp;N has expanded its community 

support efforts to help combat the 

negative impacts of COVID-19 on the 

less privileged and vulnerable groups. 

The Group has contributed towards 

helping vulnerable communities through 

product sponsorships to the elderly 

and to children from low-income 

families. Through partnerships with 

local organisations, such as Everyday 

Heroes SG, F&amp;N has donated products to 

frontline healthcare workers to show our 

appreciation for their tremendous efforts 

in helping to combat the COVID-19 

virus. In these challenging times, F&amp;N 

is strongly committed to supporting 

impacted communities in order to ensure 

their resilience and to help them get 

through this crisis.

F&amp;N’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 

In 2020, the unprecedented situation 

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 

resulted in a significant impact on people 

and businesses around the world. It has 

highlighted the importance of managing 

material social risks and opportunities 

among key stakeholder groups, such as 

employees, suppliers, customers and the 

community, as they have an impact on 

business continuity. 

Having integrated sustainability into our 

operations, we have implemented BCP to 

respond to this challenging context. As 

our employees’ safety, health and well-

being are of utmost importance to us, we 

have made use of digital mediums (e.g. 

videoconferencing software such as Zoom 

and Microsoft Teams) to replace the need 

for physical meetings and business travels. 

Flexible working arrangements (e.g. 

staggering of working hours to start at 

different times, work-from-home policies, 

split team arrangements) have also 

been adopted to reduce the interactions 

between our employees in order to 

protect them. Compliance with the social 

distancing measures during the Circuit 

Breaker period in Singapore, Movement 

Control Order (“MCO”) in Malaysia and 

the emergency decree in Thailand were 

also ensured. Our employees are the 

heart of our business operations and 

to safeguard them would ensure the 

continuity of business operations. 

By means of a resilient supply chain and 

partnership with suppliers, F&amp;N ensured 

minimal disruption during this period. 

By having regular engagements with 

suppliers and working with them to 

ensure healthy inventory levels,  

F&amp;N was equipped to cope with the 

negative impacts of the COVID-19 virus. 

For example, during the MCO in Malaysia, 

by working with raw and packaging 

material suppliers, F&amp;NHB had strived to 

ensure maximum output while having to 

operate under reduced production hours 

and workforce that was stipulated by the 

authorities.

Maintaining the lines of communication 

with customers helped ensure that an 

adequate supply of core F&amp;N products 

is made available to them amidst the 

uncertainties. The use of social media 

to introduce our latest products and the 

use of online platforms (e.g. F&amp;NHB’s 

F&amp;N Life website and/or mobile app) to 

facilitate bulk orders of products are some 

of the alternate methods through which 

we ensured continued contact with our 

customers and reduced disruptions to the 

downstream flow of business operations.

To provide support for communities 

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, 

F&amp;N reinforced its engagement through 

product donations for less privileged 

and vulnerable groups. F&amp;NHB donated 

products to university students, old folks’ 

homes, orphanages and people who were 

stranded in the Red Zones in Malaysia.  

To show our appreciation and gratitude  

to the front-line healthcare workers,  

F&amp;N had also donated products to help 

them keep hydrated and energised 

while they worked tirelessly to fight the 

virus. The recipients in Singapore include 

National University Hospital Singapore 

(“NUHS”), Ng Teng Fong Hospital, 

Alexandra Hospital; Yishun dormitory 

workers, and Food Bank Singapore 

beneficiaries, while the recipients in 

Malaysia include Sungai Buloh Hospital, 

Selayang Hospital, Kuala Lumpur Hospital 

and Queen Elizabeth Hospital; the Royal 

Malaysia Police, the National Disaster 

Management Agency and a number of 

city councils, among others.

 More information regarding the initiatives 

being implemented during COVID-19 can 

be located in the 'Response to COVID-19' 

chapter of this report.

TOWARDS F&amp;N 2025 

SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS 

F&amp;N looks forward to 2021 as we 

embark on our journey towards our 

2025 sustainability ambitions. As part of 

this journey, we aim to further expand 

our positive contribution to sustainable 

development and play our part to 

address the complex and interconnected 

challenges of sustainability. 

During the course of 2020, the Group 

conducted a robust materiality assessment, 

by engaging internal and external 

stakeholders, in order to refresh the 

sustainability targets for 2025 and reflect 

our sustainability priorities in the face of 

the everchanging sustainability landscape. 

These 2025 sustainability targets will 

drive our sustainability performance 

throughout our business and strengthen 

our commitment to create long-term value 

for our stakeholders. 

 More information on the conduct of the 

materiality assessment can be found on 

page 25 of this report.

F&amp;N appreciates your interest in our 2020 

Sustainability Report and is very grateful 

for your continuous support.

Fraser and Neave, Limited (“F&amp;N” or the “Group”) originated 

more than a century ago from the spirited decisions of two 

enterprising young men, John Fraser and David Neave,  

who diversified from their printing business to pioneer the 

aerated water business in Southeast Asia (“SEA”) in 1883. 

The entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by our founders,  

remains in today’s F&amp;N. As a soft drink company, F&amp;N seized  

the opportunity and ventured into the beer brewing business  

in 1931 in partnership with The Heineken Company and built 

a very successful beer empire in Asia Pacific – through its joint 

venture company, Asia Pacific Breweries Limited (“APB”).  

In 1959, it entered the Dairies business by forming a canned 

milk joint venture with Beatrice Foods of Chicago, and in 

2007, it acquired Nestle’s liquid canned milk business in 

Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and accelerated its 

growth in the dairy business. Today, F&amp;N is the largest canned 

milk producer in SEA. In 1985, the Group diversified into the 

Properties business. Starting with the redevelopment of its 

soft drinks and brewery sites in Singapore, F&amp;N soon grew 

its property arm – Frasers Centrepoint Limited (“FCL”, now 

known as Frasers Property Limited) to become one of the 

leading property companies in Singapore with multi-national 

businesses in residential, hospitality, retail, commercial and 

industrial properties.

In 2012, F&amp;N divested its equity stake in APB to realise 

a substantial value for shareholders. In 2014, the Group 

demerged FCL through a listing on the Singapore Stock 

Exchange, thereby transferring value to shareholders.

one of the most established and successful companies

The preparation, production and packaging of our beverages and consumables for printing requires a range of raw 

materials, equipment, and other goods and services. In FY2020, we engaged with over 4,700 global and local suppliers 

across our supply chain. F&amp;N worked with manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, importer/merchants, contractors, 

professional services providers, etc. and spent a total of about SGD1.34 billion on products and services.

Sourcing 

To provide the highest quality standards for our 

customers and consumers, we have also been 

seeking out and working with suppliers who 

meet high quality in standards and are socially, 

ethically and environmentally responsible. To ensure 

the sustainability of our business, we have risk 

management mechanisms in place to manage issues 

associated with the commodities.

We minimise the impact of post-consumer  

waste by delivering innovative and environmental-

friendly packaging. We continuously seek out 

sustainable packaging that also meets the  

needs of our consumers. In addition to applying 

Circular Economy principles throughout F&amp;N,  

we also promote environmental awareness in the 

communities we operate.

Distribution 

We have a fully integrated and extensive distribution system to ensure that our products are efficiently 

distributed to our customers and consumers. Our focus is to minimise the environmental and social impacts from 

transportation by managing energy usage while safeguarding the safety of our personnel and local communities. 

We also continuously innovate our processes and implement digital technologies to drive efficiency. 

Production 

We have implemented a standardised safe 

production process, in accordance with international 

standards, throughout our operations. We strive for 

eco-efficient processes, in which we optimise the 

socio-economic value we create, while minimising 

our negative environmental and social impacts from 

all production stages.

Marketing  

and Sales 

Responsible marketing and sales practices are of 

great importance to F&amp;N. We demonstrate societal 

responsibility by providing healthier product options 

and informative product labels. We also work with 

regulators and seek feedback from our customers 

on our products to improve our marketing practices.

MANAGEMENT AND 

GOVERNANCE

Governance Structure

Sustainability is embedded in F&amp;N’s 

culture. As part of the Board’s 

Conduct of Affairs, the Board 

“considers sustainability issues such as 

environmental and social factors as part 

of its strategic formulation”. Hence, the 

Board ensures F&amp;N’s long-term business 

direction is guided by sustainability 

principles, and they have ultimate 

oversight of all sustainability issues.

The SRMC ensures sustainability risks 

and opportunities are considered at the 

highest level of F&amp;N by providing strong 

support to the management team. The 

SRMC has the responsibility to approve 

all strategic initiatives and policies 

related to sustainability.

Headed by Chief Executive Officer Non-

Alcoholic Beverages, and supported by 

senior personnel from key functions, 

regions and levels, the SDC supports the 

SRMC by providing general direction, 

monitoring and reporting the progress 

of F&amp;N’s sustainability projects.

The SDC is supported by the 

Sustainability Development Working 

Team, which consists of cross-functional 

representatives who take on the various 

roles of: Sustainability Reporting 

Secretariat; Pillar Heads; Sustainability 

Initiative Champions; and Data Owners. 

Together, they monitor the progress 

of designated goals, drive initiatives at 

operational level, identify challenges 

in performance, and gather data for 

reporting. 

In FY2020, the SRMC and SDC each 

convened three times on sustainability 

matters.

Our Sustainability Approach

Risk Management

F&amp;N integrates material sustainability topics into our overall 

Risk Management framework by identifying specific risks, 

opportunities and key priorities for the financial year in order 

to drive our strategic decisions. This helps us to innovate 

better products and create more meaningful value for our 

stakeholders. Specific sustainability risks are identified and 

dealt with as part of the Enterprise Risk Management  

(“ERM”) framework. For instance, Management considers  

the potential impacts of climate change on our business,  

including measures to mitigate water scarcity. Risk appetite 

and risk tolerance statements are reviewed by the SRMC and 

approved by the Board annually. At the end of the financial 

year, the Board receives assurance from the Chief Executive 

Officers, senior personnel from key functions and the Chief 

Financial Officer that the risk management and system of 

internal controls in place for the Group are adequate and 

effective to address risks which the Group considers relevant 

and material to its operations. 

 For more information on F&amp;N’s risk management of sustainability 

topics integrated with other topics, please refer to our Annual 

Report (pg. 60).

Key Policies

F&amp;N’s governance system is supported by various policies and 

frameworks put in place to ensure that relevant controls are in 

place and our people are working as intended.

F&amp;N supports the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights, International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) 

guidelines, Singapore’s Employment Act, Thailand’s Labour 

Protection Act and the Malaysia Employment Act 1955, and 

have extended these guidelines and legal requirements in our 

internal policies.

All F&amp;N Directors and employees pledge to adhere to F&amp;N’s 

Code of Business Conduct, which includes principles related 

to integrity, respect and excellence. The Code is reviewed with 

new employees as part of their induction programme,  

while updates are communicated to staff by email and are  

also made available on our intranet.

 

Any violation of Code can be reported via these mechanisms:

1. 

Reporting mechanism provided in existing F&amp;N Group 

policies

2. 

Whistleblowing policy

In FY2020, there were no substantiated bribery and corruption 

cases.

F&amp;N has stringent criterion for donations and sponsorships 

as according to the F&amp;N Group Anti-Bribery Policy. 

Whistleblowing of suspected bribery and corruption can  

be reported to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.  

There have been zero reports of corruption and bribery  

in this financial year.

F&amp;NHB also has a Code of Business Practices for Third 

Parties, putting in place an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 

Management System to consolidate and manage elements, 

policies, objectives and processes in relation to bribery and 

corruption risks. 100% of our employees in Malaysia have 

made the Integrity Pledge and Declaration of Conflict of 

Interest submissions. There have been zero number of pledge 

breaches recorded in FY2020.

F&amp;N suppliers are expected to conduct their business in 

accordance with ethical business standards and applicable 

laws, following the F&amp;N Supplier Code of Practice.  

Suppliers are expected to treat their employees equally, with 

respect and dignity, in accordance with ILO standards and 

applicable labour laws.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

F&amp;N’s stakeholders include any individual or group who are 

impacted by or interested in our activities. We strive to build 

and maintain strong relationships based on trust and respect 

with all stakeholders and utilise various platforms where they 

can voice their opinions and suggestions, as shown in the 

table below. Information received via these channels is used in 

our planning and strategy for sustainable value creation.

Our Sustainability Approach

MATERIAL MATTERS

We undertook our first materiality assessment in 2017 to evaluate our most important sustainability issues. This assessment was 

based on three steps: Identification; Prioritisation; and Validation.

Materiality Assessment Process

We first conducted a 

comparative analysis 

of sustainability issues 

identified by global 

initiatives (such as the UN 

SDGs) and best practices 

of peer companies in the 

industry. These issues were 

then discussed with the 

SDC to identify the ones 

most material to F&amp;N. Our 

employees were surveyed in 

order to make sure that our 

identification process was 

accurate, and a list of 15 

key issues was finalised.

To prioritise our 

sustainability issues, we 

engaged department 

heads, the C-suite, and 

the Board in a materiality 

workshop. The workshop 

involved an in-depth 

discussion of each 

identified sustainability 

issue, including the 

likelihood of impact on our 

business and stakeholders. 

Each issue was then 

prioritised on a scale of 

‘moderate’ to ‘high’.

After the preliminary 

materiality matrix was 

developed, we proceeded 

to validate it through 

engagements with the SDC 

and the Board.

Since the initial materiality assessment 

conducted in 2017, F&amp;N has continued  

to review and refine, where necessary,  

the materiality topics yearly. There were 

no changes to the 13 material topics from 

2019. The materiality topics can be seen in 

the FY2020 materiality matrix below.

We endeavour to comprehensively 

disclose our growth strategies and 

measures to address the opportunities 

and risks affecting our operating 

environment. These matters have also 

been identified as significant to our 

stakeholders and have the potential to 

impact our delivery of value in the short, 

medium and long-term. To fairly and 

sufficiently discuss our material matters 

and the performance targets to which 

we have committed ourselves, we need 

to clearly define what each of these 

sustainability topics mean to the Group.

Our most significant material topic 

‘Consumer Health and Safety’ is 

extremely relevant this year amidst the 

COVID-19 pandemic as communities 

are becoming increasingly aware of 

the importance of their health and 

hygiene. ‘Economic Performance’ is 

vital as we continue to balance our 

contributions to frontliners and people 

in need with our financial performance. 

‘Occupational Health and Safety’ is 

also receiving more focus in light of the 

COVID-19 pandemic as we take steps 

to keep our employees safe. 

The material issues have been mapped 

following the structure of the six pillars 

of our Sustainability framework and  

the UN SDGs they contribute to. 

Through this framework, we align our 

business and sustainability goals with a 

sharper focus on how we create value 

for each material issue as well as our 

contribution towards the UN SDGs, 

particularly towards Goal 3; Goal 4; 

Goal 6; Goal 8; Goal 9; Goal 10; Goal 

12; Goal 13; Goal 14.

Updating Our Material Issues

1. Identification

 

We conducted a materiality assessment in March this 

year with the support of an independent consultant. 

An initial list of 50 ESG topics were identified. It was 

narrowed down to 18 material ESG topics through peer 

benchmarking and external trends analysis. 

2. Prioritisation

 

To prioritise the 18 material ESG topics, we sought input 

from both internal and external stakeholders through

a. 

Engaging 16 external stakeholders from across 

our stakeholder groups. The interviews with the 

stakeholders were conducted through audio calls 

using Microsoft Teams, and they were sent a 

questionnaire beforehand. One of the questions  

in the questionnaire requested the stakeholders to 

select from the list of 18 material topics and rank  

the material topics according to how important they 

felt it should be for F&amp;N.

b. Conducting two internal materiality assessment 

executive workshops, one in Singapore and one 

in Malaysia, with over 50 participants from senior 

management. One of the activities tasked the 

attendees to select from the list of 18 material topics 

and rank the material topics based on how important 

its impact would be on F&amp;N.

c. 

Carrying out an employee survey which had over 

950 responses from across the Group. One of the 

questions in the survey gave our employees the 

choice to indicate which amongst the list of 18 

material topics they felt were more important to  

F&amp;N and to rank those material topics accordingly in 

terms of importance.

 

The feedback received from the internal and external 

stakeholders was consolidated and used in the overall 

ranking of the 18 material ESG topics to determine our 

key material ESG topics. They were plotted in a matrix 

based on their importance to stakeholders (external) and 

to F&amp;N’s business (internal).

3. Validation

 

The 2021 materiality matrix and 2025 sustainability 

targets were endorsed by the SDC in August 2020 and 

approved by the SRMC in September 2020. Detailed 

information on them will be disclosed in the F&amp;N 

Sustainability Report 2021.

 

This process enabled us to refresh our materiality matrix 

for FY2021 and set medium term 2025 sustainability 

targets, especially for our ‘high’ materiality issues.

Circular Economy

A circular business model can be defined 

as the way an organisation creates, 

delivers and captures value with and 

within closed material loops and chains. 

F&amp;N is committed to work towards a 

more circular economy by preserving 

the value of resources for as long as 

possible, and applying circular economy 

principles of:

• Prioritising renewable inputs

• Keeping products and materials in use

• Recovering by-products and waste.

Our approach to managing materiality 

topics is guided by these principles. More 

than half of our materiality topics have 

links to circular economy: 

• Innovation: We creatively design new 

solutions for products and processes 

which contribute to resource efficiency 

and the prevention of waste. F&amp;N built 

a new innovation centre in Singapore 

for R&amp;D focusing on health and 

sustainability. Other than packaging, 

the innovation centre will also look into 

water efficiencies, energy conservation, 

environmental programs and waste 

management with Singapore’s BCA 

Green Mark Platinum award as the 

target. 

 Refer to page 34 for more information. 

• Water Stewardship: We manage 

water use and recover and reuse water 

where possible. In Singapore, as our soya 

process is one of the more water intensive 

processes, we evaluated our soya activities 

and implemented operational changes. 

Compared to 2019, water usage in 2020 

was reduced by 42%. 

 Refer to page 59 for more information. 

• Effluents and Waste: We minimise 

waste (in production and post-

consumption) and help to create 

by-products from the residual liquid and 

solid waste. We are proud to announce 

that we have significantly exceeded 

our 2020 target to reduce solid waste 

intensity by 5%. 

 Specific initiatives are elaborated in  

page 62.

• Packaging: We reduce raw materials 

needed and aim to ensure that 

packaging can be recycled, reused or 

composted. F&amp;N proactively innovates, 

develop and source sustainable 

packaging solutions for our products. 

We have implemented various 

packaging solutions in 2019 and are on 

track to meet our goal to have 100% 

of F&amp;N’s beverage packaging to be 

recyclable by 2021. 

 Refer to page 65 for more information.

• Energy and Climate Change: 

We reduce our energy needs,  

use renewable and/or recover energy 

from our operations. Our energy and 

climate change strategy includes: 

improving energy efficiency in our 

operations, renewable energy sourcing 

and generation, reducing carbon in 

our value chain, route planning and 

reducing operations exposure to 

climate change risks. 

 Refer to page 69 for more information.

• Sustainable Sourcing: We favour 

suppliers whose environmental 

practices adhere to circular economy 

principles. In June 2020, we have 

launched a new Supplier Code of 

Practice which covers Business Ethics, 

Environmental Management, Human 

Rights and Occupational Health and 

Safety. 

 Refer to page 74 for more information.

• Creating Value for Society: Beyond 

the company, F&amp;N raises awareness 

of circular economy and good waste 

management practices through 

conducting education programmes for 

students in Malaysia and Thailand.

Response to COVID-19

IMPACT OF COVID-19 FOR OUR 

BUSINESS AND STAKEHOLDERS

In 2020, the unprecedented situation 

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 

had significant impacts on people 

and businesses around the world. 

It has reinforced the materiality of 

environmental and social topics by 

showing just how connected we 

are as a global society and how 

sustainability risks can very quickly 

create an impact across the economic 

system. COVID-19 highlights the 

importance of our Economic and 

Social material issues including 

Consumer Health and Safety, 

Occupational Health and Safety, 

Sustainable Sourcing, Creating Value 

for Society, and Innovation.

Our commitment to addressing 

sustainability through our material 

issues helps to ensure the resilience 

of our business and stakeholders to 

external shocks such as COVID-19.

F&amp;N COVID-19 RESPONSE AND 

LEARNINGS

F&amp;N has reacted to the pandemic with 

a focus on the following material topics:

Economic Performance: 

Business continuity to deliver 

stakeholder value

During 2020, F&amp;N aimed to maintain 

a resilient economic performance in 

the face of external shocks to continue 

to deliver value for all stakeholders. 

For example, in Malaysia, we worked 

to maximise output despite reduced 

production hours and workforce during 

the MCO period. 

 More information can be found in the 

'Economic Performance' chapter  

(page 33) of this report.

Governance &amp; Risk Management: 

Structures and plans to manage 

systemic shocks

COVID-19 reinforces the importance 

of integrating non-financial risks into 

our risk management processes.  

This helps to prepare for possible 

future impacts of social and 

environmental shocks. F&amp;N cannot 

control external factors (pandemics, 

climate change) but can make 

preparations internally to ensure 

business continuity.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, 

stakeholder engagement was critical 

for F&amp;N to address key challenges  

and ensure business continuity.  

For example, F&amp;NHB maintained 

ongoing dialogues with regulators, 

through the government and industry 

affairs department, to ensure operations 

and workforce were compliant with 

regulations, permits and screening 

mechanisms. This ensured that 

operations avoided unnecessary delays 

and disruptions.

 More information can be found in the 

'Our Sustainability Approach' chapter 

(page 16) of this report.

Response to COVID-19

Occupational Health &amp; Safety: 

Ensuring the well-being of our 

employees is our first priority

Despite limitations and difficulties 

due to COVID-19, F&amp;N has not 

compromised our ongoing safety 

related trainings. In 2020, we 

continued to conduct annual safety 

trainings and awareness sessions 

using virtual formats, as well as 

new training on COVID-related 

risks. Throughout the pandemic, we 

have communicated regularly with 

employees regarding the changing 

government requirements and 

business response. This includes best 

practices in personal hygiene and 

social distancing as well as up to date 

health and travel advice.

 More information can be found in 

the 'Occupational Health and Safety' 

chapter (page 78) of this report.

Talent Management: 

COVID-19 has accelerated the  

pace of our transition to the  

Future of Work

F&amp;N equips employees with skills to 

succeed in the ‘new normal’. Training 

and resources are available to enable 

employees with the skills to perform 

effectively in a remote working 

environment with focus areas such 

as self-management, communication 

with different generations and 

cultures, virtual people management 

and team-working. We expedite 

employees for the shift in future 

technology by providing training in 

Cyber Security, Industry 4.0, Data 

Analytics and Introduction to Robotic 

Process Automation as well as setting 

up digital platforms for specific 

functions. We have also updated our 

leadership development programs 

to focus on leading change in an 

uncertain world.

 More information can be found in the 

'Talent Management' chapter (page 38) 

of this report.

Consumer Health &amp; Safety: 

Reinforcing our commitment to 

healthy products and lifestyles

F&amp;N continues to increase our offering 

of Healthier Choice products. Our 

product development team responded 

to consumer demands for healthy, 

immune building products. F&amp;N has 

launched healthy drinks to boost the 

immune system such as SUNKIST 

Pure, which contains multivitamins to 

strengthen immunity, F&amp;N NUTRISOY 

Fresh Soya Milk with Real Oats &amp; 

Quinoa, which contains more protein 

and calcium as compared to other 

soya bean drinks, F&amp;N ICE MOUNTAIN 

Sparkling Water in Peach Flavour, 

which has zero sugar and zero calories, 

and OYOSHI GOLD which includes 

antioxidants.

F&amp;N implemented wider activities to 

encourage a healthy lifestyle during 

lockdown. In Thailand, F&amp;N helped 

consumers stay fit and healthy during 

COVID-19 by sharing healthy cooking 

tips and recipes using social media 

platforms, including information 

on keeping a healthy diet during 

lockdown. In Malaysia and Singapore, 

F&amp;N conducted virtual fitness 

challenges and organised workout 

sessions with athletes and influencers 

for consumers to participate in.

 More information can be found in the 

'Consumer Health and Safety' chapter 

(page 83) of this report.

Innovation: 

Supporting consumer needs  

during the pandemic

At the same time, consumers are 

looking for quick and easy products 

to support new patterns of living and 

working. F&amp;NHB strengthened its 

e-commerce presence with the launch 

of a flagship online store, F&amp;N Life,  

to offer convenience and accessibility 

to Malaysian consumers. This platform 

was rolled out in January and scaled 

up to support Malaysians during the 

COVID-19 pandemic. This provided an 

easier platform for consumers to bulk 

order their favourite F&amp;N products 

at competitive prices and have them 

delivered to their homes.

 More information can be found in the 

'Innovation' chapter (page 34) of this 

report.

Sustainable Sourcing: 

Partnering to ensure supply chain 

resilience and avoid disruption

We work closely with our trade 

partners and suppliers to ensure 

minimal disruption during this period. 

We are committed to supporting 

our customers, trade partners and 

communities with adequate supply 

of core F&amp;N products amidst this 

uncertain period. F&amp;N recognises 

the need to replace conventional 

business continuity planning with new 

ways of collaboration with suppliers 

and customers to continue ensuring 

availability of stocks.

 More information can be found in the 

'Sustainable Sourcing' chapter (page 74) 

of this report.

Creating Value for Society: 

Supporting local communities 

through the COVID-19 pandemic

F&amp;N supported national efforts 

through product donations for 

vulnerable groups including elderly 

people, low-income families, 

healthcare workers and migrant 

workers in Singapore, Malaysia and 

Thailand.

 More information can be found in the 

'Creating Value for Society' chapter

Driving Economic Value

Economic 

Performance

GRI 201-1



F&amp;N’s business success is based upon 

long-term value creation for our 

stakeholders. We achieve this by 

maintaining leadership in our core 

markets, and by leveraging innovative 

technologies and employees’ expertise 

to meet consumers’ evolving demands 

and enter new markets. Our economic 

performance provides us with a firm 

foundation to continue delivering the 

products which our customers love.

Our Value Creation model is explained in 

detail on pages 14 - 15 of this report.  

F&amp;N economic performance depends 

upon all six capitals (financial, 

manufactured, intellectual, human,  

social &amp; relationship, and natural).  

Thus F&amp;N’s ability to create financial 

value is supported by our sustainability 

initiatives.

APPROACH

F&amp;N generates economic value in a 

number of ways. Full information 

is included in our audited financial 

statements, as part of our FY2020 

Annual Report:

 Group Financial Highlights,  

pages 10-11

 Group Financial Statements,  

pages 84-189

During 2020, F&amp;N maintained a resilient 

economic performance in the face of 

external shocks, to continue to deliver 

value for all stakeholders.

Innovation

Driving Economic Value



Innovation is central to long-term  

value creation. We continuously evolve 

to deliver new and unique product 

offerings which cater to consumers’ 

changing needs, for example, towards 

more beverage choices, flexibility and 

affordability. Through innovation,  

we also improve the operational efficiency 

of our manufacturing processes and better 

manage our impacts on the environment. 

The idea of the ‘circular economy’— 

of decoupling our activities from the 

consumption of finite resources—is one 

which drives us to make continuous 

improvements. We continuously 

innovate for longer shelf life and greater 

recyclability of our products.

2020 Target

To invest in product and 

process innovation to 

increase our product range 

and improve efficiency and 

productivity.

PERFORMANCE

Consumer-Focused Product 

Innovation

At F&amp;N, we continuously deliver new 

and unique product offerings to meet 

consumers’ evolving needs. We strive 

to deliver our “Pure Enjoyment. Pure 

Goodness” promise to our consumers 

by offering choices in different product 

categories, healthier options without 

compromising on taste and convenience 

through differentiation in packaging to 

cater to consumers’ needs.

We draw upon local knowledge to 

develop products that our consumers 

love. We launched several new 

products during FY2020, with each one 

undergoing comprehensive tests,  

before they even reach the shelves, 

to ensure that they are safe for our 

consumers and of the desired quality.

The goals of R&amp;D at F&amp;N are guided by the following five principles

In Malaysia, consumers are 

shifting to purchase from digital 

platforms. The launch of F&amp;N’s first 

e-commerce site provides an easier 

platform for consumers to bulk 

order their favourite F&amp;N products 

at competitive prices for delivery to 

their homes. Besides catering  

to consumers’ convenience,  

F&amp;N Life also offers product details, 

nutrition values, recipes and loyalty 

programmes. There are close to 250 

products available on the F&amp;N Life 

platform. The F&amp;N Life mobile app 

can be found on both Google Play 

Store and Apple’s App Store or at 

www.fnlife.com.my.

 

F&amp;N is also partnering with mobile 

payment providers to provide 

greater convenience for consumers.  

F&amp;NHB partnered with the largest 

e-Wallet payment provider in 

Malaysia, Touch ‘n Go eWallet, to 

offer cashback for money spent on 

F&amp;N Life. F&amp;NHB also collaborates 

with the digital merchant platform,  

Fave, to offer exclusive new 

products and trial packs to 

consumers.

3. Employee-driven innovation – 

Excel as One Convention

 

Employees of F&amp;NDT have once 

again promoted continuous 

improvements in productivity, 

quality, cost, delivery, safety, ethics 

and environment by developing 

innovative cost-saving initiatives 

at the F&amp;NDT WCM Excel As One 

Convention 2020 held on 17th 

September 2020. This convention 

has successfully achieved average 

cost savings of about THB30 million 

(SGD1.8 million) annually thus far. 

 

Themed 'Sport to Build Immunity 

Fighting COVID-19', F&amp;NDT 

encourages and motivates employees 

to come up with continuous 

improvement and innovation projects 

which would help strengthen 

staff’s immune systems during the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

 

The activities cover more than a 

thousand relevant topics where 

employees were able to showcase 

their projects through exhibition 

boards and models. Their learnings 

and knowledge were then 

shared to improve the company's 

manufacturing operation.

4. F&amp;NDT’s new Regional 

Distribution Centre (“RDC”) to 

optimise operational efficiency

 

This year, F&amp;NDT invested in a new 

RDC in Rojana, Ayutthaya province, 

Thailand. The RDC is equipped with 

a RM40 million (SGD13.2 million) 

automated storage and retrieval 

system. Strategically located 1.7km 

from F&amp;NDT’s manufacturing plant 

in Rojana, Ayutthaya province, 

the 20,000 square metres RDC is 

expected to be operational in 2021. 

This RDC will serve as the regional 

distribution hub for F&amp;NDT products. 

 

Apart from optimising and reducing 

operational costs, and meeting 

storage capacity demand with 

smaller space requirement, the 

Automated Storage and Retrieval 

System (“ASRS”) enables centralised 

inventory which will enhance stock 

management accuracy. Additionally, 

the ASRS will create a fully 

integrated distribution centre with an 

enterprise resource planning system 

and efficient information flow.  

We will also be installing the same 

ASRS in F&amp;NHB’s new warehouse in 

Shah Alam, which is expected to be 

operational in 2021.

Our people differentiate F&amp;N from 

our peers and determine our success. 

We strive to create a stimulating work 

environment where fresh perspectives 

are valued, talent is nurtured and 

rewarded, and employees are engaged, 

challenged and empowered to perform 

to their highest potential, thereby 

enabling the company to meet our 

business objectives. We constantly look 

to hire and retain talent who will enable 

us to maintain our competitive edge and 

expand in the international market. F&amp;N 

contributes to the UN SDG 8’s target to 

achieve full and productive employment 

and decent work for all.

In this chapter, we describe the core 

elements of our Talent Management 

strategy, which is driven by our  

Human Capital Roadmap 2025 and  

7 Modules for Strategic Human Capital 

Transformation. 

This section also describes F&amp;N’s 

acceleration in our transition to 

the Future of Work, in light of the 

unprecedented situation and impacts on 

our people and activities caused by the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

APPROACH

We recognise the importance of diversity 

in terms of cultural background, age and 

gender, in order to enrich the workplace 

with fresh perspectives that will enable us 

to meet our business objectives.

F&amp;N strives to offer equal opportunities 

for all regardless of an individual’s race, 

gender, religion and any other attributes 

unrelated to employment expectations. 

We comply strictly with prevailing 

legislation on employment rights in  

our countries of operation, including  

no hiring of minors. In Singapore,  

F&amp;N employs staff beyond the statutory 

retirement age of 62, providing 

employment to older individuals.

While 38% of all employees in F&amp;N are 

female, our positive approach to gender 

equity can be seen from the female 

representation at managerial levels, 

where 44% of managerial positions are 

held by female employees. 

As of 30 Sep 2020, F&amp;N has over 7,700 

employees. Most employees work  

full-time, and about 13% of all hires 

are working under temporary contracts. 

About 25% of all F&amp;N employees have 

been with the company for over a 

decade, and the employee turnover rate 

sits at about 36% this year.

Human Resource (“HR”) Excellence Awards 2019

1. Clear Structure and Roles

 

We use the ‘Beverest’ system to integrate our Human Capital 

processes and systems across the Group. This helps us to 

make sure that each employee is aware of the expectations 

and responsibilities for their role, their team and for the 

Group as a whole. Beverest is the foundation for a range of 

Human Capital related processes, from recruitment and  

on-boarding to career development.

2. Market-Oriented Compensation and Benefits

 

We pay employee competitive wages and offer competitive 

benefits. In addition, the Group carries out regular reviews to 

ensure that our remuneration packages remain in line with 

its peers’ and in harmony throughout the Group. Benefits 

provided to full-time employees include life insurance, 

health care, disability and invalidity coverage, parental leave, 

retirement provision, and stock ownership options (share-

based incentive plans).

 

F&amp;N’s Human Capital policies go beyond standard labour 

regulations and statutory requirements. For example,  

F&amp;NHB actively engages with union leaders from their 

seven formal employee-unions to have balanced collective 

agreements. F&amp;N does not restrict the freedom of association.

through their impactful CSR framework. The Excellence in 

Innovative Use of HR Tech, which F&amp;N was awarded the Bronze 

Winner, emphasises the effective use of technology in reducing 

inefficiencies and adding value to HR’s functional excellence, 

all while reaping business benefits.

Human Capital Roadmap and Strategy

F&amp;N has a strategic plan to establish ourselves as a preferred 

employer. This is guided by our Human Capital Roadmap to 

2020, and specifically our 7 Modules for Strategic Human 

Capital Transformation. Each is explained in more details 

below.





F&amp;N was one of the finalists for the “Excellence in Corporate 

Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Strategy” and “Excellence 

Innovative Use of HR Tech” awards. The Excellence in CSR 

Strategy honours organisations that are inspiring role models

On-boarding

 

F&amp;N strives to promote from within 

and maximise opportunities for the 

excellent talent already available to

Human Capital team ensures that 

we are able to recruit and welcome 

external applicants with abilities that 

match the Group’s needs. 

 

Our interviewers are trained to ensure 

that the interview process is fair and 

effective. We ensure that all new 

recruits benefit from a comprehensive 

and consistent on-boarding 

programme across the Group. This 

includes a mix of self-serve e-learning 

and one-on-one support.

 

Our ‘Future-Ready Manager 

Programme’ ensures that we 

replenish and grow our pool of 

future executives. We use a variety of 

assessment tools as part of a rigorous 

process to recruit the most suitable 

candidates. As soon as they join the 

team, the successful candidates begin 

a formal two-year programme to get 

a wide variety of experience.

Human Capital Vision, Mission and Strategic Intents 

Towards 2025

To guide our Human Capital Vision, Mission and Strategic 

Intents towards the next phase until 2025, we have developed 

COVID-19 has accelerated our transition to the Future  

of Work

While the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 

pandemic resulted in significant impacts on our people, it was 

also an opportunity to accelerate F&amp;N’s transition to the Future 

of Work. F&amp;N took the opportunity to assess our organisational 

design, increase adoption of digital technology and equip our 

employees with the necessary digital skills. We also ensured our 

employees’ well-being as they adapt to the new normal. 

1. Assessing organisational design and increasing agility 

of F&amp;N’s workforce

 

F&amp;N recognised that COVID-19 would change the way 

our organisation works and looked into expanding 

succession plans to account for unforeseen emergencies, 

new national regulations and measures that might 

be put in place. We made the necessary adjustments 

when the Circuit Breaker, MCO and state of emergency 

was announced in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand 

respectively. 

 

F&amp;N also made plans to facilitate re-deployment for jobs 

that were affected through initiatives such as the internal 

career mobility programme. While some roles were  

re-designed to enable employees to work from home,  

no roles were made redundant due to the COVID-19 

situation as roles and scope of work remained largely 

unchanged. Plans to hire contract workers and freelancers 

were also put in place to allow the company to be more 

nimble in adjusting manpower needs to business needs.

 

As part of the efforts to increase our workforce’s agility, 

employees were encouraged to adopt new skills through 

job rotations and upskill themselves. The trainings provided 

covered topics such as self-management, enhancing 

communication between different generations and 

cultures, professional writing, people management, 

working as a team in remote working environments, 

leading change in the ‘Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity 

and Ambiguity’ world, etc.

2. Increasing adoption of digital 

technology and equipping our 

employees with the necessary 

digital skills

 

As part of accelerating towards 

the future of work, trainings were 

provided to facilitate adaptation to 

the new normal of working from 

home and digital communication. 

Various trainings were offered to 

our employees, such as the SAP 

training for the Finance Department, 

Cyber Security training for the IT 

Department and other trainings such 

as Digital Transformation Awareness, 

Industry 4.0, Data Analytics and 

Introduction to RPA for employees. 

 

This meant increased adoption 

of e-Learning, virtual classrooms, 

utilisation of learning management 

systems, platforms and apps. 

Microsoft Teams and Zoom are 

currently extensively used by 

employees in Singapore and Malaysia 

as virtual communication solutions. 

Today, our staff engagement and 

welfare sessions are effectively 

conducted virtually. For instance, 

we had organised virtual lunch 

talks, virtual exercise classes such 

as piloxing, and successfully 

implemented telemedicine.

 

As working from home becomes 

the new normal for Singapore and 

Malaysia, e-communication will be 

encouraged as a medium to replace 

physical meetings and reduce the 

frequency of business travels in 

future.

3. Supporting and caring for our 

employees remotely during  

tough times 

 

We ensured that our employees’ 

well-being was taken care of, even 

when we were not physically working 

together. Health talks and fitness 

classes were organised during Phase 

1 of the Circuit Breaker period in 

Singapore. Care Packs containing an 

oral thermometer, two face masks 

Empowering Our People

and a hand sanitiser were issued to  

employees and cleaners who  

belonged to the Pioneer and Merdeka 

Generations. A lump sum of $200 

was paid out to all supervisory /

APPROACH

F&amp;N’s hiring practices are aligned with 

the interests of the local economies 

in which we operate, and we are 

determined to be the employer of 

choice and a role model for others. 

We are proud that 100% of our senior 

management in Singapore and Thailand 

and 98% of our senior management 

in Malaysia are hired from the local 

community. This helps to keep the  

value created by F&amp;N within the 

local economy and ensures that we 

understand the local markets. 

Notes:

1. 

Local employees are defined as people who are either born in or who have legal rights to reside 

permanently in our significant locations of operations.

2. 

Our significant locations of operation (for the business entities covered in this report are Singapore,

Our compensation packages have 

been standardised across the Group to 

ensure that the highest expectations are 

being embodied across our operations. 

These standards are strictly maintained 

and also reviewed frequently to 

allow for necessary adaptations with 

local circumstances. Market-based 

compensations are offered to fresh 

graduates. In general, managers are 

promoted from within the company (as 

opposed to new hires) so as to motivate 

employees by setting a clear career 

trajectory within the organisation.

F&amp;N does not participate in nor condone 

forced or child labour, the use of 

intimidation or any manipulation of 

workers.

47


Enhancing Social Well-being

2020 Target

We will continue to provide 

outreach and engagement 

programmes across Singapore, 

Malaysia and Thailand by 

exploring and implementing 

appropriate outreach 

programmes to address 

community needs.

F&amp;N believes that through promoting a  

more equal society with diversity,  

equal opportunities and social 

inclusion, business and society will 

flourish together. As such, we support 

and connect with local communities, 

strengthen relationships between 

different cultures and maintain a positive 

corporate image by establishing strong 

relationships with the community.

In this section, we detail our commitment 

and initiatives to strengthen vulnerable 

groups, promote environmental 

protection and support active lifestyles. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had significant 

impacts on vulnerable communities and 

our commitment to support them during 

this period is more critical than ever.

Creating Value For 

Society

GRI 413-1 









APPROACH

In each market that we operate, we undertake a number of long and short-term 

programmes that serve to create greater social equity. To that end, F&amp;N has developed 

four main thematic areas where we focus our community endeavours. This year,  

in light of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, one new thematic area has been 

included to show how additional support is provided to the local community.

1. Strengthening Vulnerable Groups 

 

Inequality of wealth and opportunity is a major global challenge. Our consumers 

and employees come from all segments of society and inequality undermines 

the development and potential of not only our communities but also our 

business. To take leadership in tackling this issue, we have chosen to focus on 

strengthening vulnerable groups such as underprivileged children. Through 

investing in educational programmes including both technical skills and soft 

skills, F&amp;N works towards promoting a more equal society in terms of diversity, 

equal opportunities and social inclusion, where business and society flourish 

together.

2. Promoting Environmental Consciousness 

 

While companies have a critical role to play in minimising environmental footprint, 

sustainable development means a partnership, and this includes behavioural 

changes at the individual level. Besides maintaining eco-efficiency in our 

operations, we have taken the task of promoting environmental consciousness in 

our communities as another priority. As F&amp;N continues to move towards a circular 

economy model of business, we are sharing lessons and also learning from 

communities about how to implement our ideas.

3. Spreading Festive Cheer 

 

In addition to basic needs and environmental sustainability, our community 

development programme includes a priority with regard to our brand promise, 

which is delivering “Pure Enjoyment. Pure Goodness” to all. We believe that 

spreading festive cheer helps our communities connect with each other and 

strengthens relationships between different cultures. Here, we aim to promote 

diversity and foster national unity in our communities.

4. Promoting Healthy Lifestyle &amp; Nutrition 

 

As a F&amp;B business, F&amp;N’s products contribute to the health and well-being 

of our communities. Therefore, we consider it our obligation to facilitate 

responsible consumption and balanced lifestyles. This is mostly accomplished 

through the consumption of F&amp;N products to maintain a healthy lifestyle in line 

with consumer needs. We also prioritise community investments that support 

sports and active lifestyles to better care for our consumers while also creating 

value for communities.

 

Because of the COVID-19 circumstances, most of our activities to encourage a 

healthy lifestyle were conducted virtually. F&amp;N also helped consumers stay fit 

and healthy during COVID-19 by sharing healthy cooking tips and recipes using 

social media platforms, including information on keeping a healthy diet during 

the period of lockdown.

5. Supporting local communities 

during COVID-19

 

The unprecedented situation caused 

by the COVID-19 pandemic has 

had a significant impact on people. 

To show our support and solidarity 

with vulnerable communities, 

F&amp;N also contributed to national 

efforts through product donations 

for vulnerable groups including 

elderly people, low-income families, 

healthcare workers and migrant 

workers.

Enhancing Social Well-being

PERFORMANCE

1. Strengthening Vulnerable Groups

MALAYSIA: F&amp;NHB International Computer Driving 

License (“ICDL”) Annual Programme

This year, 53 students from the vocational training 

institute successfully received their ICDL certification 

in Graphic Design Management and Computer 

Management after going through an intense six-module 

training programme. Since 2010, F&amp;NHB has invested a 

total of RM185,000 (SGD61,000) in three F&amp;N IT Corners 

at Montfort Boys Town in Shah Alam.



MALAYSIA: Empowering Lives through Education 

(“E.L.I.T.E.”) Programme

Since 2011, we have worked to tackle the issue of 

education insufficiency for marginalised children and to 

build a foundation for lifelong learning. The F&amp;NHB E.L.I.T.E. 

programme provides pre-school education to children 

between five and six years old at Pangsapuri Enggang, 

Puchong, Selangor in collaboration with Kassim Chin 

Humanity Foundation. F&amp;NHB has also contributed over 

RM580,000 (SGD191,400) in cash and more than 600 

cartons of F&amp;N milk and soya products to aid in school 

funding and the nutritional needs of the children attending 

the kindergarten and tuition centre. This year, F&amp;NHB 

contributed nearly RM50,000 (SGD16,500) and 100 cartons 

of F&amp;N products to ease the Foundation’s financial burden.



SINGAPORE: F&amp;N's Donation in support of 

President's Challenge 2020

In July 2020, F&amp;N donated SGD20,000 to SHINE Children 

and Youth Services, “SHINE” (a President’s Challenge 

benefitting agency), as part of our sustained commitment 

towards engaging and empowering the youth in our 

community. F&amp;N’s donation will go towards supporting 

SHINE’s training programmes and services which aim  

to maximise the potential of underprivileged or at-risk 

children and youth aged 5 to 21 years. 

The President’s Challenge (“PC”) is an annual community 

outreach and fund-raising campaign to help the less 

fortunate, with the slogan “Give freely and live fully”. 

It aims to build a more caring and inclusive society in 

Singapore by uniting a community of holistic givers. 

On 20 November 2020, F&amp;N attended the annual PC 

Appreciation Event 2020 which was held virtually for the 

first time. As one of the esteemed partners of PC,  

F&amp;N was privileged to receive a token of appreciation 



from President Halimah Yacob via an exclusive afternoon tea 

session in recognition of our support towards PC2020.  

This token serves as an affirmation of F&amp;N’s desire to 

continue empowering the vulnerable in our communities 

through our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts despite 

the challenges posed by COVID-19 this year, and a testimony 

to our belief that sustainable business growth occurs when 

our communities grow alongside us.

2. Promoting Environmental Consciousness

MALAYSIA: “Recycle for a Life Cycle” Day

F&amp;NHB’s annual School Recycling Programme, Recycle for 

a Life Cycle Day, aims to promote the 5R philosophy of 

Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink and Reinvent amongst 

primary and secondary school students. This year,  

we went to schools in Kuching and Kota Samarahan, 

Sarawak and Seberang Perai, Penang. The events were 

organised in collaboration with the district and state 

government, Tetra Pak (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., recycling 

partners and non-governmental organisations.

From the survey that F&amp;NHB had conducted with 237 

schoolteachers from Penang, Selangor and Kuching in 

2019, 100% of respondents agreed that our programme 

has helped to improve their community and over 84% 

rated our programme as either ‘effective’ or ‘extremely 

effective’. 



THAILAND: Waste Bank and Recycling Project

The F&amp;NDT Waste Bank and Recycling Project was 

implemented at 2 schools in Thailand - Wattanodtia 

School and Watkokmayom School in the Ayutthaya 

Province. More than 170 students and teachers 

learnt how to dispose of waste and/or recycle them 

appropriately, and the impact of poor waste management 

on the environment and the society. Recycling also 

provides tangible monetary benefits to the students of 

Watkokmayom School through selling the recyclables. 

Approximately THB150,000 (SGD6,750) was spent on 

improving the waste management infrastructure of the 

schools from setting up recycling stations to renovating 

waste storage areas.



THAILAND: Water Champagne Tanks for Dairy 

Farmers

In the Chaiyaphum Province in Thailand, F&amp;NDT installed 

water tanks to provide efficient water supply for 

communities and dairy farmers. This project minimises  

the need to travel long distances to access reservoirs  

for water resources during seasonal droughts.  

The THB460,000 (SGD20,700) investment can supply 

about 1,680,000 litres of water every month to up to 180 

households across communities in Chaiyaphum province. 

This provides sufficient water supply for up to 24 farms, 

consisting of 955 cattle, to minimise the disruption from 

drought and ensure farmers can continue their farming 

operations sustainably.

2. Promoting Environmental Consciousness

THAILAND: Sustainable Development  

Farming Project

Starting 2014, as part of a joint effort between F&amp;NDT 

and ThaiBev, the Farming Excellence system was 

developed and shared with dairy farmers supplying milk. 

This has benefitted all parties – F&amp;NDT receives good 

quality raw milk; more income for dairy farmers as they 

implement the sufficiency economy principles and reduce 

cost through increased efficiency; and ultimately, better 

quality products for consumers.

Since 2019, the focus has been on the new farming 

excellence handbook and circular economy. 



There are 3 initiatives under this phase of the project:

1. Booklet/Guidelines to improve milk quality – to train/

mentor new dairy farmers on Good Manufacturing 

Practices (“GMP”). This has benefitted an estimated 

1,500 – 2,500 farms across 10 Cooperatives.

MALAYSIA: Save Our Seas Programme

The F&amp;NHB Save Our Seas team made a dive recently at 

Redang Island to perform regular checks and maintenance 

on the man-made reefs that we have been planting since 

2011. Our internal dive team and partners conducted reef 

rehabilitation initiatives by collecting coral fragments and 

planting them in nursery sites, then transplanting them to 

permanent sites at Paku Kecil and Terumbu Kiri. Our coral 

reef rehabilitation initiative has now shown promising 

rejuvenation with different colonies of coral on the man-

made reefs.

2. Promoting Environmental Consciousness

SINGAPORE: Recycle N Save

Recycle N Save is a joint initiative by F&amp;N and the NEA 

of Singapore to place Smart RVMs across Singapore. 

This joint initiative aims to encourage recycling of used 

plastic drink bottles and aluminium drink cans amongst 

Singaporeans and supports the national vision of the 

Sustainable Singapore Blueprint’s goal to increase the 

national recycling rate to 70% by 2030.

Launched in October 2019, at Our Tampines Hub in 

Singapore, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, the then Singapore 

Minister of Environment and Water Resources, was the 

Guest-of-Honour. He along with Mr Tan Meng Dui,  

Chief Executive Officer of NEA, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Group 

Chief Executive Officer, NTUC Fairprice Group, Mr Suhaimi 

Rafdi, Director of Our Tampines Hub, and Ms Jennifer See, 

Managing Director, Singapore and Yoke Food Industries 

Malaysia, FNFS, commenced this initiative. Phase 1 of the 

launch saw 10 Smart RVMs being installed nationwide, 

with support from our trade partner, NTUC Fairprice. 

Public could drop in their used and empty aluminium 

drink cans and plastic bottles in exchange for discount 

vouchers at NTUC. 

This year, together with four new partners, CapitaLand 

Malls, Sport Singapore, Sentosa Development Corporation 

and Anywheel, we installed 50 Smart RVMs island wide. 

Placed in shopping centres across the island, the public 



can choose from a wider range of rewards when they 

deposit used and empty drink cans and plastic bottles.  

Since the launch of Recycle N Save in 2019, over 3.1 million 

plastic beverage bottles and aluminium cans have been 

collected.

 

The RVM School Education Programme, under the Recycle 

N Save initiative, was also launched in March 2020. In the 

first run, five RVMs were placed in primary and secondary 

schools for a six-month period. Students were encouraged 

to proactively collect empty plastic drink bottles and 

aluminium drink cans, and deposit them into the RVMs 

located at their schools. The schools had also organised their 

own environmental education activities to tie in with the 

placement of these RVMs.

3. Spreading Festive Cheer

MALAYSIA: ‘Tabahkan Hatimu, Sinarkan 

Ramadanmu’ Hari Raya Aidilfitri Celebration

The ‘Tabahkan Hatimu, Sinarkan Ramadanmu’ 

programme is part of F&amp;NHB’s annual initiative to 

spread Ramadan cheer to the less fortunate since 2004. 

F&amp;NHB marked this year’s Ramadan by contributing over 

one million in products and essentials to the nation’s 

frontliners, underprivileged families and individuals. 

During the holy month, F&amp;NHB also pledged to support 

10,000 families from B40 communities in Peninsular and 

East Malaysia with provisions. 

Through the programme, more than 500,000 F&amp;N 

products including 100PLUS drinks and special meal boxes 

were contributed to frontliners, including hospitals, police 

stations and fire stations.

MALAYSIA: Recognising Local Sports Personalities

F&amp;NHB has been the main sponsor of the Sportswriters 

Association of Malaysia (“SAM”)-100PLUS Awards since 

2006. This year, the 15th SAM-100PLUS Awards was held on 

12 August, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 

situation. Cyclist Azizulhasni Awang won the Athlete of the 

Year and para powerlifter Bonnie Bunyau Gustin won the 

Para Athlete of the Year.

3. Spreading Festive Cheer

MALAYSIA: A Treat for our Street Friends during the Hari 

Raya Week

While most people are celebrating Hari Raya Aidilfitri with 

family and loved ones, our street friends, at temporary shelters 

set up by the Government, were not forgotten. Street Feeders 

of KL, a grassroots movement founded in 2011, served 

breakfast at one of the temporary shelters set up at Pusat 

Komuniti Setiwangsa, from the 24 May 2020 to 31 May 

2020. F&amp;NHB was delighted to support their noble effort with 

our products such as F&amp;N SEASONS Soya, F&amp;N SEASONS Tea 

and SUNKIST Juice, to help provide hydration and nutrition.

MALAYSIA: F&amp;N Brings Joy to the Less Fortunate during 

Chinese New Year

F&amp;NHB volunteers celebrated Chinese New Year with over 

500 under privileged residents from 10 homes/centres in 10 

locations throughout Malaysia. During the month of February 

2020, over 100 volunteers visited these 10 homes/centres in 

Penang, Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, Johor, Kuantan,  

Kuala Terengganu, Kota Bahru, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. 

F&amp;NHB donated basic necessities and household items to 

assist the home in its upkeep, while our volunteers went 

around to personally extend festive greetings and distribute 

‘ang paus’ and goodie bags to all residents.

MALAYSIA: F&amp;N Spreads Chinese New Year Joy to 

Underprivileged Students

The Group’s regional office in Kota Kinabalu welcomed the 

Year of the Rat by organising an early Chinese New Year 

celebration with underprivileged students from their region – 

70 boarders at San Damiano Girls Hostel in Kiulu. F&amp;NHB staff 

mingled with the boarders and contributed daily necessities 

comprising of rice, oil, biscuits, grocery items, condensed milk 

and school stationery to the hostel. The boarders also received 

‘ang paus’ and mandarin oranges.

MALAYSIA: Fun-Baking Session for the Underprivileged 

Children During Deepavali

During this festive season, F&amp;NHB staff visited Persatuan 

Rumah Kebajikan Rita and organised a fun baking session 

for the underprivileged children. F&amp;NHB also donated various 

baking machineries, utensils and ingredients to Rumah Rita. 

These provided residents with more opportunities to test 

their baking skills in the kitchen, and also helped the home 

generate income for the upkeep of the centre and to cover 

the children’s daily expenses such as school fees, clothing and 

food.

to frontline officers at health and hospital clinics in Kota 

Kinabalu commented "This effort was a task for the 

sacrifice of the front row officers in struggling to control the 

contagion of this plague. May this cooperation continue for 

the future so that more people in need can (get) help."

MALAYSIA: F&amp;N Reaches Out to Needy Students and

F&amp;NHB donated a three-weeks supply of 150 cartons of F&amp;N 

ICE MOUNTAIN bottled water and a few cartons of 100PLUS 

to be distributed to those in need and to the volunteers. Our 

small contribution has allowed Pit Stop Community Café to 

continue its work in feeding about 2,000 people throughout 

the MCO.

MALAYSIA: F&amp;N Gives the Gift of Clean Drinking 

Water

About 1,000 stateless individuals reside off the coast of  

the Omadal Island, Semporna, Sabah, with no access 

to clean water. F&amp;NHB donated cartons of F&amp;N ICE 

MOUNTAIN mineral water to these communities through a 

non-profit organisation, Iskul Sama DiLaut Omadal (known 

as Sekolah Bajau Laut Omadal in the Bajau language). 

Bottles of mineral water were distributed to each family, 

along with other basic necessities such as rice, sugar, flour, 

noodles, sweetened creamer and tea bags. As an effort to 

conserve the environment and reduce pollution, Iskul Sama 

Dilaut Omadal collected and recycled the empty drinking 

water bottles.

Iskul Sama DiLaut Omadal commented "Thank you again 

F&amp;N Malaysia for this kind sponsorship. The gift of clean 

drinking water is utmost important to their lives. Most of 

them live without clean running water and electricity."

Eco-efficiency

Eco-efficiency refers to the act of 

maximising benefits and minimising 

ecological costs. As part of our materiality 

assessment, we identified four main 

issues in relation to our eco-efficiency 

efforts:

In the following pages, we will explain our targets, management approach and 

performance for each of our eco-efficiency areas of focus. We will show that  

eco-efficiency is not only just about reducing the environmental impacts of our 

operations, but also often makes good business sense for F&amp;N. 

Our Environmental, Safety and Health Policy 

All of our operations are guided by the following principles, to:

Our employees, business partners and stakeholder groups are 

aware of our Environmental Policy and have given their support 

for our goals. These policies are reviewed regularly to ensure 

they are valid and up to date. 

 

comply with applicable environmental, safety and 

health, legal and other requirements and also work with 

relevant statutory bodies to provide and maintain a safe, 

green working environment

 

develop, review and carry out Environmental Impacts 

and Occupational Risk Assessments to take appropriate 

control measures for prevention of pollution, injury and 

illness

 

foster communication with shareholders, employees, 

customers, suppliers and local communities to protect 

the environment and to have hazard free condition

 

provide and maintain relevant training, instruction, 

information, resources and supervision to our 

employees about our commitments and encourage 

their involvement in Environmental, Safety &amp; Health 

Programmes

 

ensure continual improvement in the Environmental, 

Safety and Health Management system and standards

 

strive for Zero Waste, Zero Pollution and Zero Accident 

through continual improvement in our management 

systems and processes

We implement environmentally 

sustainable business practices in 

alignment with F&amp;N’s core values and  

the circular economy principles.  

This means that our approach is not  

only about minimising resource inputs,  

but also ensuring that outputs are useful 

wherever possible, either to F&amp;N or to 

other organisations.

All employees are at all times guided 

by our Environmental, Safety &amp; Health 

(“ESH”) Policy.

Stewardship

GRI 303-3 (2018); GRI 303-5 (2018) 



As a responsible corporate leader,  

F&amp;N ensures that our operations bring 

value to the community around us and 

do not negatively affect anyone. A lack 

of effective water management can have 

serious implications as F&amp;N’s products 

and business are dependent on a reliable 

supply of water. We are committed 

to responsible water stewardship and 

managing our water use accordingly 

to safeguard availability of clean water 

supply for local communities.

APPROACH

While none of our sites are in high 

water-stress areas, many regions in 

both Thailand and Malaysia have faced 

floods in recent years, and the effects of 

climate change are expected to intensify 

water stress in the future. Guided by 

the F&amp;N ESH Policy and the principles 

of a circular economy, we are adept at 

developing transitions and initiatives 

to cope with water stress and optimise 

our water consumption by identifying 

and addressing water-related risks and 

opportunities, and collaborating in 

partnership with relevant stakeholders.

While none of our sites are in high  

water-stress areas, many regions in  

both Thailand and Malaysia have faced 

floods in recent years, and the effects of 

climate change are expected to intensify 

water stress in the future. As such,  

water stewardship and its associated 

risks are regularly monitored as part of 

F&amp;NHB’s ERM by utilising tools such as 

the World Resources Institute Aqueduct 

and World Wildlife Fund Water Risk Filter. 

We have a range of water assessment 

and action policies which are applied 

across our facilities. Our Group-wide 

integrated approach includes efficiency 

measures; the safe return of wastewater 

from our operations; and mitigating risk 

in supply.

PERFORMANCE

We have a target to reduce the Group 

water intensity at our plants by 5% 

from 2017 by 2020. This year, we have 

an increase by about 18% in water 

intensity, as compared to 2017, which is 

above our 2020 target.

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has 

greatly affected our performance in 

water management. During production,  

a minimum amount of water has to be 

used automatically for each production 

run despite a decrease in production 

amount, thus resulting in a higher water 

intensity ratio than usual. 

The commissioning of numerous 

new production lines in the factories, 

since the established sustainability 

reporting baseline in 2017, have 

contributed to the increased specific 

water consumption as some of the new 

production lines require more frequent 

Clean-In-Place (“CIP”) between each 

production run in order to ensure 

product quality and safety.

Certain projects, such as the water 

recycling project at the F&amp;NHB Pulau 

Indah plant, have also been delayed due 

to the COVID-19 situation.

INITIATIVE:

We take every opportunity and approach to reduce water consumption and continue to work towards reducing our water intensity 

by implementing various projects and initiatives. Project highlights included:

1. Recognising that our soya process is one of the 

more water intensive processes at the FNFS plant, 

we evaluated our soya activities and implemented 

operational changes to improve water efficiency. The 

monthly average water usage showed a reduction of 

about 42% after the implemented changes. The total 

average yearly water savings is about 13,300m3 (cost 

savings of about SGD36,000).

 

Some of the operational changes included:

a. 

Reuse of discharged water used for cooling 

purposes. The operation process has been 

restructured to combine three discharge points 

into a single discharge point. This reuses the water 

for cooling more efficiently by optimising the 

operation process, thereby reducing water usage 

by about 720 litres per hour.

b. Fine tuning of water supply to the stone separator 

tank by replacing the manual on-off valve so 

Singapore

Eco-efficiency

operators can specify the water supply flow and 

control the water drained from the stone separator 

tank. 

c. 

Change of cleaning method from only using water 

to flush to clear the okara spillage to sweeping and 

throwing the okara spillage before flushing with 

water in order to reduce water usage needed for 

cleaning.

d. Switch from using open-end hose for cleaning 

to using a hose with spray gun for cleaning. This 

reduces water usage needed for cleaning as the 

hose with spray gun serves the same purpose with 

about 75% less water per hour. 

e. 

Stopping the CIP process based on pH reading 

instead of by time or by visual inspection. When 

the pH reading of the final rinse water is between 

6.5 and 8.5, it means that there is no more acid or 

alkaline remaining in the production line. At this 

point, the operator can accurately assess that the 

CIP process can be stopped.

Malaysia

2. F&amp;NHB Shah Alam plant

a. 

Wastewater from the Aseptic Cold-filling PET Line,  

Sugar Dissolvent Line and Canning Line is treated 

using Reverse Osmosis (“RO”) and reused as 

cooling water. This reduces water usage by about 

115,000m3 each year.

3. F&amp;NHB Pulau Indah plant

a. 

Reuse of wastewater in the cooling tower instead 

of discharging into the public drain reduces 

water usage by about 800m3 per day and saves 

approximately RM215,000 (SGD70,900) per year.

4. F&amp;NCM

a. 

Incoming water supply system is equipped with a 

carbon filter that needs to be backwashed after 

a certain amount of usage. The frequency of 

backwash has been reviewed and reassessed to 

ensure the frequency is reduced but water quality is 

not compromised.

b. Cleaning of machinery equipment requires a large 

volume of water as a certain amount of pressure 

and flowrate is needed. CIP systems have been 

upgraded to allow for the chemicals and hot water 

to be channelled back to the system for reusing.

c. 

Originally, the cooling systems were supported by 

two units of cooling towers supplying to different 

parts of the production line. By changing to a 

bigger cooling tower for supplying of water, the 

usage of water is reduced.

Eco-efficiency

Waste can be a source of value for 

our supply chain or for another 

organisation’s supply chain. Being 

able to effectively manage our waste 

enhances F&amp;N's ability to conserve 

natural resources and improve efficiency.

APPROACH

The F&amp;B manufacturing process 

involves the generation of both 

liquid (effluent) and solid wastes. 

We continue to improve on our solid 

waste management by identifying key 

categories and key waste streams in 

order to recycle and reduce our waste 

generation. We strive to reduce impacts 

from our operations, and this means

2020 Target

To reduce the Group solid 

waste intensity by 5% from 

2017 to 2020

complying with and going beyond 

relevant regulations.

Under the guidance of our 

Environmental Policy and the principles 

of a circular economy, F&amp;N explores 

opportunities to review how ‘waste’ 

can be put to alternative uses. Our 

ultimate aim is that ‘waste’ is seen 

not as a problem, but as a source of 

new value for our supply chain or for 

another organisation’s supply chain. 

Applying initiatives to promote a more 

circular economy for our operations 

and consumers enhances our ability to 

conserve natural resources and improve 

efficiency. F&amp;N applies strict standards 

over the quality of our effluent 

discharges and we continuously explore 

how ‘waste’ from our operations can be 

minimised and put to alternative uses.

PERFORMANCE

We have a target to reduce the Group 

solid waste intensity by 5% from 

2017 by 2020. This year, we have 

achieved about 47% reduction in solid 

waste intensity as compared to 2017, 

significantly exceeding our 2020 target. 

This is driven by strong performance 

across our business:

1. F&amp;NDT Rojana and Pak Chong 

plants further reduced the solid 

waste sent to landfill by about 32 

tonnes from 2019, achieving over 

90% of waste being recycled.

2. F&amp;NHB Shah Alam plant achieved 

a reduction of about 875 tonnes of 

solid waste to landfill from 2019. 

This is due to 80% of waste being 

recycled. 

3. F&amp;NHB Pulau Indah plant achieved 

zero waste to landfill with 100% of 

waste being recycled.

INITIATIVES:

Plant Management

F&amp;NDT 

Circular Economy serves as a guideline for the waste 

management at F&amp;NDT’s factories that have the capacity to 

send 99% of their waste for recycling. F&amp;NDT has launched 

a campaign to understand the economical and cost-

effective ways of using water and to reduce overall water 

usage, thus reducing overall effluents and wastewater 

generated. Treated effluents and wastewater are used 

to water plants. As part of the F&amp;NDT Water Recycling 

programme, treated wastewater is reused in the cooling 

system, reducing effluent emission by up to 33%. RO reject 

water is reused for general cleaning purposes. 

F&amp;NHB Pulau Indah plant

Zero waste is generated at F&amp;NHB Pulau Indah plant as 

100% of recyclables are sent for recycling, kitchen waste is 

sent for composting to create soil conditioner and fertiliser, 

and wastewater treatment plant slush goes through 

composting to create fertiliser.

F&amp;NHB Shah Alam plant

At F&amp;NHB Shah Alam plant, all aluminium, bottles and 

cartons are recycled, while kitchen waste is composted. 

Wastewater is reused for cleaning and in cooling towers 

instead of being discharged. A future initiative that is being 

looked into is the new technology for soya extraction which 

utilises the leftover okara (soy pulp).

Employee Awareness

In Thailand, F&amp;NDT puts Circular Economy at its core, 

creating awareness of environmental protection with 

employees. Employees are encouraged to practice 

responsible consumption and a bring-your-own initiative 

to minimise food waste and single-use packaging. They 

are aware of the proper handling of waste and waste 

separation activities which occur in the factory. Waste is 

continuously reused as an input or resource before it is 

recycled. The use of plastic bags in waste collection has 

been reduced, avoiding around 9 – 10 tonnes of plastic 

bags per year.

F&amp;NDT has also expanded their Circular Economy 

Awareness Programme to employees’ homes and schools 

around our factory to provide knowledge on proper waste 

management at schools, enabling schools to also generate 

income from waste separation and sales. F&amp;NDT also 

donates recycling bins to the schools.

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


IMPORTANCE

Circular economy is a growing focus 

area for our stakeholders. There is 

increasing stakeholder awareness of 

the importance of environmentally 

friendly packaging, especially in relation 

to plastics. The principles of a circular 

economy guide our approach to meet 

customers' and consumers' demand  

for more sustainable packaging. 

Increasing the sustainability of our 

packaging is important to support our 

national regulators and government 

effort to phase out single-use plastics 

and going zero waste, as outlined 

in Malaysia’s ‘Roadmap Towards 

Zero Single-Use Plastics 2018-2030’. 

Increasing sustainability of packaging 

will also reduce the extraction of raw 

resources and waste generation.  

The Singapore Government released 

a Zero-Waste Master Plan in August 

2019, which includes a circular economy 

approach to resource management. 

F&amp;N is committed to supporting these 

efforts and will be reassessing our 

approach over the next year, as well as 

establishing relevant targets when we 

set new sustainability goals for 2025.

APPROACH

We strive to ensure our packaging 

protects the integrity of the contents 

and fulfils the visual and functional 

expectations of our consumers. We have 

been improving our packaging materials 

by reducing material usage, increasing 

the use of sustainable materials and 

increasing the recyclability of our 

packaging. There is much scope for 

innovation in packaging, which we have 

been exploring over the years.

Circular economy principles are 

particularly important for our industry: 

the frequency of purchases can translate 

into a large amount of packaging, and 

so ‘closing the loop’ is a priority. We are 

fully committed to reducing F&amp;B waste 

by increasing shelf life and providing 

appropriate portion sizes, as well as 

increasing the recyclability of the primary 

and secondary packaging used in our 

products and sourcing more renewable 

packaging materials.

Reducing packaging materials

We continue to reduce the volume 

of packaging materials used as a 

percentage of product and are looking 

to reduce packing weight (e.g. thinner 

plastic bottles). We are minimising 

materials that are not favorable to the 

environment in our labels and flexibles 

by switching to PET, laminate paper 

packaging and TD flute in cartons. 

Increasing use of sustainable 

packaging materials

We are working to include more recycled 

content in the packaging materials, as 

well as sourcing more renewable and 

bio-based packaging materials such as 

sugarcane-based plastic. We are working 

to find new suppliers who can meet our 

requirements for sustainable packaging 

materials. For example, F&amp;NHB Pulah 

Indah plant is increasing recycled paper 

used in beverage trays.

Improving recyclability of packaging

We are increasing the recyclability of 

the primary and secondary packaging 

used in our products. This requires us to 

address challenging packaging materials 

such as labels and flexibles to find 

alternative solutions.

Collaboration

Together with ThaiBev, F&amp;NDT takes 

part in industry collaborations to realise 

closed loop recycling in their value chain 

and also supports circular economy 

and recycling learning and education 

in schools. They have also attended the 

Post-Consumer Plastic Training session 

with Dow Jones and Scientex to learn 

about post-consumer plastic.

PERFORMANCE

Overall, our PET usage intensity has 

decreased by 25.9% between 2004 and 

2020.

The Group’s packaging ratio is 0.091, 

which has dropped by about 1% 

compared to last year.

SINGAPORE: ‘Recycle N Save’ initiative

Recycle N Save is a joint initiative by F&amp;N and the NEA of 

Singapore to place Smart RVMs across Singapore. This joint 

initiative aims to encourage recycling of used plastic drink 

bottles and aluminium drink cans amongst Singaporeans 

and supports the national vision of the Sustainable 

Singapore Blueprint’s goal to increase the national recycling 

rate to 70% by 2030.

Launched in October 2019 at Our Tampines Hub in 

Singapore, phase 1 of the launch saw Smart RVMs being 

installed nationwide, with support from our trade partner, 

NTUC Fairprice. Public could drop in their used and empty 

aluminium drink cans and plastic bottles in exchange for 

discount vouchers at NTUC.

This year, together with four new partners, CapitaLand 

Malls, Sport Singapore, Sentosa Development Corporation 

and Anywheel, we installed 50 Smart RVMs island wide. 

Placed in shopping centres across the island, the public can 

choose from a wider range of rewards when they deposit 

used and empty drink cans and plastic bottles.  

The aim is to motivate Singaporeans to adopt a more 

circular lifestyle through offering a convenient and 

rewarding way to recycle empty plastic drink bottles and 

aluminium drink cans. Since the launch of Recycle N Save 

in 2019, over 3.1 million plastic beverage bottles and 

aluminium cans have been collected.

MALAYSIA: Packaging reduction at F&amp;NHB Borneo 

Springs plant

At the F&amp;NHB Bentong plant, cost savings of 

RM650,000 (SGD214,500) and packaging reduction 

of 100MT, through the reduction of paper waste by 

removing the small paper die cut pad at the bottom of 

each shrink, have been achieved.

The overall switch for secondary packaging cartons has 

led to a reduction in material consumption by 5%.

MALAYSIA: Sustainable packaging solutions at 

F&amp;NCM

Since July 2020, F&amp;NCM has started to recycle damaged 

packaging (carton box, raw material paper bag, tubs and 

lids) by appointing a certified contractor to collect them.

THAILAND: Packaging reduction at F&amp;NDT

As part of FNDT’s packaging intensity roadmap, we changed the regulator slotted cartons (“RSC”) to wrap-around cartons 

for TEAPOT Squeeze Tube products. This switch has contributed to a reduction of 20% of packaging materials used when 

compared to the previous RSC. 

For a period of nine months this year, we have progressively phased out the B flute corrugated cardboard trays to an 

alternative design to reduce our packaging material usage by September 2020. This resulted in the reduction of usage of 

annual pulp paper by about 122 tonnes per year.

SINGAPORE: Balanced web/reel paper as packaging material for wrapping books

Previously, TP purchased wrapping 

paper to wrap the printed books and 

sold the balanced web/reel papers as 

paper waste. Now, they have started 

to reuse the balanced web/reel 

paper as packaging material for the 

wrapping of books. This has resulted 

in a reduction of about 24 tonnes 

of paper waste and cost savings of 

about SGD20,000 each year.

2020 Target

To reduce the Group energy 

intensity ratio by 5% from 

2017 to 2020

To reduce the Group GHG 

emissions intensity ratio by 

5% from 2017 to 2020

Climate change is a defining global 

challenge of the 21st century, presenting 

risks to the global economy. For F&amp;N, 

climate change presents risks including 

price fluctuations in raw material 

commodities, and access to water 

resources.

Managing this topic presents the 

opportunity to turn challenges and 

risks into climate related opportunities 

for F&amp;N, for example cost savings, 

energy saving, alignment with customer 

ambitions, and support and contribute 

to the development of government 

policies. 

F&amp;N is committed to reduce our 

energy consumption and GHG 

emission intensity as one of the main 

priorities for our 2020 vision. As part 

of our contribution, we also have a 

responsibility to help minimise carbon 

footprints across our value chain, 

ranging from manufacturing, packaging, 

storage and logistics, to end use and 

disposal.

APPROACH

F&amp;N safeguards internal and external 

preparedness to realise our performance 

goals. 

Our Energy Management Policy

Our Energy Management Policy is a 

guideline that we regularly review to 

ensure that it is valid and up to date. 

All our operations are guided by the 

following principles, to: 

1. Fulfil and enhance the energy 

management system as energy 

conservation is one important part of 

our operations

2. Well manage and utilise energy 

conservation technology and best 

practices as part of our continuous 

improvement 

3. Implement and improve energy 

management systems to comply with 

relevant laws and regulations 

4. Conduct energy improvement 

programmes to optimise business 

operations 

5. Promote, support and manage 

energy conservation efficiently. 

Our employees, business partners and 

stakeholder groups are all aware of our 

Management Policy and have given 

their support for our goals. We regularly 

review the policy to ensure that it is valid 

and up to date.

Eco-efficiency

Our Energy and Climate Change Strategy, 

which aligns with ThaiBev’s climate 

change and energy strategy, is broken 

down into five priority areas:

1. Energy efficiency in our operations

2. Renewable energy sourcing and 

generation

3. Reducing carbon in our value chain

4. Route planning

5. Operations exposure to climate 

change risks. 

F&amp;N’s operations, including manufacturing, 

storage and transportation, require energy. 

We have applied a range of initiatives, 

based on circular economy principles, 

to improve our energy performance. 

We uphold this commitment in our 

entire value chain by engaging with 

our suppliers and other third-party 

management through an agreement 

to commit to environmentally friendly 

practices.

We set a GHG emissions intensity target 

to contribute to the national GHG 

emission reduction commitments of each 

nation in which we operate – Singapore’s 

government has pledged to reduce GHG 

emissions intensity ratio by 36% by 

2030, compared with 2005 levels, and 

to reach peak GHG emissions by 2030. 

Malaysia’s government has targeted a 

45% reduction in GHG intensity by 2030, 

from a 2005 baseline. Finally, Thailand 

has a reduction target of 30% by 2036, 

from a 2010 baseline.  

 

PERFORMANCE

F&amp;N has an initial target to reduce 

the Group energy and GHG emissions 

intensity ratios by 5% of 2017 levels 

by 2020. In 2020, the energy intensity 

ratio is 1,082.60 MJ/MT and the GHG 

emissions ratio is 0.114 MT CO2/MT, 

above our 2020 targets. After reviewing 

our performance, we found that some of 

the challenges which affected our energy 

and GHG management were:

1. 

The commissioning of numerous new 

production lines, since the established 

sustainability reporting baseline in 

2017, which resulted in an increased 

consumption of energy;

2. 

The change in operating process 

where the blow moulding of PET 

bottles was now done inhouse on the 

combi-fillers (as compared to the 2017 

baseline) at the F&amp;NHB Shah Alam 

plant, instead of purchasing blown 

up bottles from third-party suppliers, 

which further increases energy usage;

3. 

The launch of new products which 

require the equipment to perform 

more frequent CIP between each 

production run for the assurance of 

product quality and safety; and

4. 

The decrease in production volume as 

a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 

as there was a minimum amount 

of energy that must be consumed 

during production runs regardless of 

production volume.

INITIATIVES:

1. Energy Efficiency in Our Operations

(A) Singapore

 

TP has replaced two old 4-colors sheet-fed printing 

presses with a new high-speed energy efficient 8-colurs 

sheet-fed perfecting press in September 2020. It is 

estimated that there are energy savings of about 

210,000kWh per year. This translates to cost savings of 

over SGD25,000 and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 

about 17 tonnes each year.





Improving energy efficiency in our operations makes 

business sense just as much as it helps to reduce our 

environmental impact. Energy efficiency contributes to 

a circular economy by limiting the resources needed to 

produce valuable goods and services.

(B) Malaysia

(i) 

Pulau Indah dairy plant,

a. 

Conventional forklifts were switched to 

electrical forklifts

b. Installation of heat pumps in chillers and  

3 Variable Speed Drives for the Filler Exhaust 

Fan were done to reduce energy consumption. 

The installation of heat pumps helped to 

reduce natural gas usage by changing  

the mechanism to use steam instead.  

This contributes to potential cost savings  

of about RM153,000 (SGD50,490) per year. 

c. 

The installation of Thermal Vapour 

Recompression to reduce natural gas was 

completed in July with potential cost savings 

of about RM500,000 (SGD165,000) per year.

d. We have installed an inter region flow 

controller to regulate air compressor pressure 

to regulate electricity usage and avoid peak 

tariffs at the new fresh milk line. We recover 

our condensates back to the boiler instead of 

discharging.

(iii) Shah Alam soft drink plant 

 

We are centralising a 40-bar air compressor to 

compress the air system and stabilise supply air 

pressure. This is expected to be completed in 

November 2020. We also replaced diffusers for 

blowers for our wastewater treatment plant in 

June 2020 to save 673,000kWh per year.  

The installation of auto blowdown for boilers to 

reduce natural gas was completed in October 2019 

with 985 MMBtu natural gas savings per year.

(C) Thailand

(i) 

Rojana dairy plant

 

The switch to liquid sugar for productions has 

helped to save energy from the reduction in  

steam usage of around 150kg of steam per hour.  

The heat recovery Phase 4 from Super Agi to  

sugar dissolver gives us about THB0.70 million 

(SGD31,500) in cost savings.

(ii) F&amp;NCM plant

 

In an effort to minimise energy consumption, 

in March 2020, part of the cold room was shut 

down (small hall) and converted to a packaging 

storage room. Only the main hall was used for 

the storage of products to improve the efficiency 

of temperature maintenance. This has resulted in 

an estimated cost savings of about RM100,000 

(SGD33,000) and reduction of electricity usage by 

about 9,000kWh each year.

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


3. Reducing Carbon in Our Value Chain

As well as making improvements to our own operations 

through energy efficiency and renewable energy 

use, F&amp;N also looks into sharing best practices and 

encouraging improvements along our value chain. We 

understand that it is essential to support our business 

partners and customers to reduce their own GHG 

emission impacts. For example, F&amp;NHB is currently 

working with suppliers to implement low-carbon cooling 

mechanisms for raw materials.

2. Renewable Energy Sourcing and Generation

(A) Thailand

 

At F&amp;NDT Rojana plant, we installed a solar panel 

rooftop in April 2020. It has provided us cost savings 

of about THB6 million (SGD270,000). The THB30 

million (SGD1.35 million) solar PV system with 

1MWp generating capacity significantly reduces 

energy offtake from the grid by utilising renewable 

energy for its daily operations.

(B) Singapore

 

Plans to install a 500,000kWh rooftop solar 

photovoltaic (“PV”) system as part of the 

Rhinestone project in Singapore is underway.  

This solar PV system is anticipated to be installed by 

2022 and is expected to contribute about 3% of the 

plant’s total annual energy usage. 

(C) Malaysia

 

As part of the strategic direction to reduce fossil fuel 

consumption and carbon footprint reduction, the 

Group is exploring a renewable energy programme 

at our F&amp;NHB plants (Shah Alam, Pulau Indah and 

Bentong) which entail setting up of 3MWp solar PV 

systems at the three plants starting from October 

2020.



4. Route Planning 

Optimal route planning can help F&amp;N to reduce costs and 

be more environmental-friendly. Over the past few years, 

we have continued to streamline our distribution networks.

F&amp;NHB has made more than RM800 million  

(SGD264 million) of capital investments since 2014 

on new lines and warehouses across their production 

facilities in various locations. This decentralisation 

strategy also means that their manufacturing and 

warehouse operations are closer together, resulting in 

shorter routes to market and lower carbon emissions 

from logistics.

To further optimise route planning, RM180 million 

(SGD59.4 million) has been invested in the new 

integrated warehouse at the F&amp;NHB Shah Alam plant, 

equipped with an ASRS. This new warehouse is expected 

to commence operations in FY2021.

The ASRS will manage the automated process of 

getting finished goods ready for delivery to market 

or distributors’ warehouse. The system will drive 

improvement through:

• More accurate stock management

• Elimination of product damage caused by mishandling

• In-sourcing of break bulk activities

• Reduction of time spent by workers at the warehouse

• Improvement in warehouse safety

5. Operations Exposure to Climate Change Risks

F&amp;N’s operations and supply chain face risks due to 

climate change impacts. This includes impacts from 

rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, farming 

shortages and water availability. Climate change risks 

are monitored and managed as part of our ERM process, 

which is under the responsibility of the SRMC.  

For example, at F&amp;NHB, identified climate change related 

risks include flooding and mineral water sourcing and 

contamination. To manage these risks, they work closely 

with state authorities and local councils which monitor 

climate-change risks. We also have robust incident 

escalation procedures and response plans in place as 

part of our Business Continuity Management.

73


Responsible Supply Chain

2020 Target

To purchase RSPO credits for 

100% of palm oil usage by 2020

As a market-leading F&amp;B company, 

we constantly work with our business 

partners, suppliers and vendors to 

understand their needs, and deliver 

mutually sustainable solutions that 

create long lasting value. We also lead by 

example, encouraging others to improve 

sustainability performance throughout 

their supply chain. F&amp;N is committed to 

Sustainable Sourcing and supports the 

production of sustainable palm oil.

The following chapter outlines some of 

the ways we work with and influence 

other companies.

APPROACH

In the past year, we have engagements 

with over 4,700 global and local suppliers 

across our supply chain, including 

manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, 

importers/merchants, contractors and 

professional services providers.  

We recognised that sustainability in  

our own operations is insufficient  

and we have to also work with business 

partners to ensure good practices are 

shared across our supply chain.

Circular economy principles include 

reassessing what is meant by a ‘resource’: 

for example, one organisation’s waste 

may end up becoming a valuable 

resource for another organisation. 

Hence, we look to understand suppliers’ 

needs and establish mutually beneficial 

partnerships for circular economy 

solutions. 

The Group works closely with our 

suppliers to ensure standards and 

practices for food safety and the 

environment are maintained throughout 

the value chain. For example, F&amp;NHB is 

a member of the Supplier Ethical Data 

Exchange and conducts regular audits 

on our suppliers to ensure standards 

and practices for food safety and the 

environment are maintained throughout 

the value chain. F&amp;N supports the UN 

Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights across our value chain.

Our Procurement Policy covers our full 

commitment to standard principles of 

ethical business practices throughout 

the supply chain. While we have a 

business imperative to obtain goods 

and services at the best price in a timely 

manner, this is done only through 

means that adhere to guidelines and 

principles of fair play and transparency.

New Supplier Code of Practice

This year, we launched a new Supplier 

Code of Practice which covers 

environmental and social impacts.  

The scope includes the following areas:

1. Business Ethics – Suppliers are 

expected to conduct their business 

in accordance with ethical business 

standards and applicable laws

2. Environmental Management – 

Suppliers are expected to conduct 

their business in an environmentally 

responsible manner

3. Human Rights – Suppliers are 

expected to treat their employees 

equally, with respect and dignity,  

in accordance with ILO standards 

and applicable labor laws

4. Occupational Health and Safety 

– Suppliers are expected to procure 

and maintain proper workplaces 

and working environments which 

are safe and hygienic, in accordance 

with applicable laws

F&amp;N is in the midst of communicating 

the new Supplier Code of Practice to 

all suppliers and ensuring that they are 

compliant with the new terms. After all 

suppliers understand and have signed 

the Supplier Code of Practice, audits will 

be conducted to monitor performance 

of key suppliers against the specified 

requirements.

Sustainable sourcing – Palm Oil

Our target for ‘Sustainable Sourcing’ 

specifically relates to palm oil.  

Although this represents a relatively 

minor proportion of our expenditure,  

it has potentially major indirect impacts 

as irresponsible palm oil cultivation 

has caused — and continues to cause 

— significant environmental and 

social damage. We understand that 

our actions and business practices 

pertaining to the support of the 

production of sustainable palm oil 

is important and, having become an 

ordinary member of RSPO in August 

2017, we reiterate our support for  

the use of Certified Sustainable Palm  

Oil (“CSPO”) in our products.  

F&amp;N’s approach has been through RSPO 

with a focus on RSPO credits, and we 

will be embarking on the RSPO Mass 

Balance supply chain model. 

Sustainable sourcing – Sugar

Another key commodity F&amp;N focuses 

its sustainable sourcing efforts on is 

sugar. Sugar is a significant commodity 

used within F&amp;N products, and we 

are currently developing a sustainable 

sourcing approach for this specific 

commodity, under the guidance of  

VIVE sugar certification programme. 

Sustainable 

Sourcing

GRI 204-1 





74

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


F&amp;NHB has purchased 20,000 metric 

tonnes of VIVE certified sustainable 

sugar which will be consumed within 

this financial year. F&amp;NDT is also 

exploring the possibility of using 

BONSUCRO certified sugar products  

for our operations in Thailand.

Sustainable sourcing – Paper

Sustainable sourcing of paper as a 

material in the supply chain is key to 

ensure that harmful environmental and 

social impacts are mitigated or reduced 

to a minimum. As paper is an essential 

component in F&amp;N’s printing operations, 

we understand the importance of 

sourcing paper sustainably and support 

sustainable forest management.  

To show our commitment, Times 

Publishing Group has achieved the 

Programme for the Endorsement of 

Forest Certification (“PEFC”) chain of 

custody certification. The PEFC chain of 

custody certification tracks forest-based 

products from sustainable sources to 

the final product. It demonstrates that 

each step of the supply chain is closely 

monitored through independent auditing 

to ensure that unsustainable sources 

are excluded. This has been an ongoing 

initiative since 2009.

Responsible Supply Chain

Screening our suppliers

At F&amp;N, we have a systematic screening process for all new suppliers using environmental and social criteria.  

These criteria reflect the commitments towards the environment (such as reducing waste, pollution and protecting 

water resources) and society (including human rights and labour practices). The environmental performance of their  

raw material and packaging material suppliers are also assessed periodically to ensure compliance to the following:

Addressing risks in our Supply 

Chain

High variable costs and uncertain 

availability of raw materials pose 

commercial risks to F&amp;N. We therefore 

undertake risk assessments on our 

suppliers’ prices and capacity to deliver 

goods and services. For key risk items, 

we have established Business Continuity 

Plans to ensure its supply. 

We conduct periodic supplier audits 

to ensure compliance with food safety 

regulations and specific standards.  

We assess a range of quality assurance 

and food safety criteria to safeguard 

the health of consumers and the 

safety of workers in our supply chain. 

Criteria include the implementation 

and monitoring of good manufacturing 

processes, use of protective clothing, 

food safety management systems, and 

chemical management.

Non-compliant or underperforming 

suppliers must demonstrate that they 

are committed to take the necessary 

corrective actions within a predefined 

period, or risk having their contracts 

terminated and blacklisted. This year, 

critical suppliers were audited on food 

safety regulations and standards,  

and none were found to be in  

non-compliance.

PERFORMANCE

Eco-credentials 

We source raw materials that are certified 

with eco-credentials, such as the  

Forest Stewardship Council ("FSC") and 

CSPO, to ensure that they are produced 

in an environmentally and sociably 

responsible manner. All paper products 

used in the carton packaging of our chilled 

beverages carry the FSC certification. 

In 2020, we have successfully met our 

target to purchase RSPO credits for 100% 

of our projected palm oil usage, which 

represents an improvement of 30% 

compared to last year.

Supporting Local Suppliers

F&amp;N engages with local suppliers, where 

possible, to support the local economy 

and minimise the carbon footprint from

transportation. More than 90% of our 

suppliers are local, representing almost 

70% of our purchase value expenditures.

Ensuring Supply Chain Resilience 

during COVID-19

To ensure supply chain resilience and 

avoid disruptions, F&amp;N works closely 

with our trade partners and suppliers 

to manage and minimise disruption 

during this period, We are committed 

to supporting our customers, trade 

partners and the community as a whole 

with adequate supply and availability 

of core F&amp;N products amidst these 

uncertainties. F&amp;N has recognised the 

need to replace conventional business 

continuity planning with new ways 

of collaboration with suppliers and 

customers to continue delivering stocks.

Working with suppliers is critical to 

maintain inventory levels and avoid 

running out of stock. F&amp;NHB conducted 

a supplier assessment exercise to 

understand the resiliency of our supply 

chain and implement mitigation 

measures for suppliers that may not be 

able to meet demands. F&amp;N’s diverse 

pool of suppliers, including strong 

relationships with local suppliers,  

also helped mitigate the risk of 

disruption from one critical supplier. 

In Malaysia, F&amp;NHB issued weekly supply 

chain bulletins to keep all suppliers 

informed of the changing situation and 

respective actions taken, and work closely 

with key retailers to ensure core products 

like canned milk, UHT and water are 

sufficiently stocked in their warehouses 

for long-term consumption. They have 

kept the supply chain cost competitive 

while exceeding service levels despite 

reduced manpower due to the MCO in 

Malaysia. 

In Thailand, the Supplier Productivity 

Enhancement Programme has been 

implemented to help F&amp;NDT’s suppliers 

manage supply shocks and disruptions. 

Through their work with suppliers F&amp;NDT 

was able to maintain a 3-month stock 

minimum to mitigate any impact to 

inventory levels.

F&amp;N works to support customers during 

periods of uncertainty when cash 

flow is likely to be tight. In view of the 

exceptional challenges brought about 

by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have 

worked together with several customers 

on flexible payment terms and payment 

extensions.

Safety and Well-being

At F&amp;N, we believe that working as a 

team is the only way to achieve our 

target of zero lost time injury. We 

foster a proactive ‘safety first’ culture 

for employees to be aware of their 

Creating a Safety Culture

At F&amp;N, safety is integrated across our 

operations through the implementation 

of ESH systems and monitoring processes.  

Our adhesion to international standards, 

such as ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and 

OHSAS 18001 for our major sites, 

demonstrates that our safety practices 

extend beyond compliance with national 

regulations. All employees, workers 

and activities are covered by our ESH 

systems, and all workers receive adequate 

training and safety equipment wherever 

appropriate.

As safety plays a central role at our 

plants, each one has its own Safety 

Committee, which includes management 

and workers’ representatives. F&amp;N 

has also set up a Safety and Health 

Committee for its corporate office.

Safety and Well-being

Enhanced Health and Safety 

Measures during COVID-19

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

F&amp;N has taken effective measures to 

protect its employees’ health and safety, 

and prevent the spread of infection, 

while ensuring business continuity.  

To reduce the risk of employees’ 

exposure, F&amp;N has encouraged all its 

employees to adopt work from home 

and split team arrangements.  

Various safety and prevention measures 

have been implemented to ensure that 

all our premises maintain strict hygiene 

practice and a clean environment. 

F&amp;N has provided sufficient personal 

protection equipment for all 

employees e.g. masks, hand sanitizers, 

thermometers. In Singapore, care packs, 

containing an oral thermometer, two face 

masks and a hand sanitiser, were issued 

to employees and cleaners who belonged 

to the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation. 

Facilities are inspected weekly by safety 

management officers. There is daily 

sanitisation and cleaning after each work 

shift, and special chemical sanitisation 

every 2 weeks. F&amp;N implemented safe 

distancing measures at all workplaces 

to be in compliance with government 

regulations, as well as daily contactless 

temperature screenings for all staff 

working on site or in office. Specific 

advisory and protective equipment are 

provided to protect front-line workers 

at particular risk e.g. receptionists, sales 

and delivery personnel. F&amp;NHB upgraded 

key office facilities to avoid contact 

e.g. replacing cash with e-payment 

and replacing biometrics with face 

scanning. F&amp;N also supports national 

movement monitoring initiatives via QR 

code (MySejahtera and Selangkah apps 

in Malaysia and SafeEntry in Singapore) 

and regular health related declarations. 

Travel restrictions are implemented for 

all employees in accordance with F&amp;N’s 

guidelines and national requirements, and 

regular health and travel advisory updates 

are disseminated. 

F&amp;N adapted our work practices to 

support employee safety and well-being. 

All employees with family members 

working in medical front-line roles 

can work from home. To support our 

employees working remotely or from 

alternate sites during this time, we have 

made some technological adjustments 

such as shifting to online meetings 

and video calls, and we have upgraded 

employees’ IT equipment when required. 

For those working on site or in the office, 

work/lunch hours have been staggered 

and high-risk activities such as sampling 

and promotion activities were stopped. 

Going forward, we plan to formalise our 

flexible work arrangement policy where 

practical.

F&amp;N has developed mechanisms to 

protect employees’ jobs, leveraging 

Fortitude/Resilience/Solidarity/Unity 

Budgets such as the Enhanced Job 

Support Scheme and the Enhanced Wage 

Credit Scheme.

For Malaysian employees who were 

forced to stay in Singapore due to the 

Malaysia MCO, F&amp;N implemented the 

following measures:

• Provision of hotel accommodation to 

approximately 130 employees who 

were not able to stay with friends or 

relatives in Singapore.

• Provision of a daily meal allowance and 

parking reimbursement for all affected 

employees.

• Provision of free laundry service for 

employees staying in hotels.

Throughout the pandemic, we 

communicated transparently and 

regularly with employees regarding the 

changing government requirements 

and business response. This includes 

best practices in personal hygiene and 

social distancing as well as up to date 

health and travel advice. For F&amp;NHB, our 

‘Fraserians Connect’ app has been a key 

tool for internal communication.  

We also support employee wellbeing 

during periods of lockdown or work-from-

home, including providing virtual sports 

classes and fitness activities, telemedicine 

programs and virtual lunch talks.

Healthy Workforce

Our Health Risk Assessment Committee 

comprises skilled personnel trained to 

comprehensively evaluate areas where 

employees may be exposed to health 

risks. It is a priority for F&amp;N to ensure that 

the workplace is conducive to employees’ 

well-being.

Our work environment is enhanced with 

ergonomic facilities to prevent office-

related injuries and includes shower 

facilities to help employees integrate 

physical activity into their daily work life. 

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 

changes, access to company-organised 

sport events or F&amp;N’s sport facilities  

and classes was limited. Instead,  

we have developed resources to guide 

employees’ mental and physical health 

through wellness talks and broadcasts. 

In Malaysia, F&amp;NHB organised a 

wellness programme across the whole 

organisation, while F&amp;NDT arranged a 

health wellness activity at the factory. 

In Singapore, we conducted virtual 

sport classes during Phase I of the 

lockdown and we developed an outreach 

programme through a partnership with 

Lianhe ZaoBao (a daily newspaper) to 

promote a healthy lifestyle to senior staff.

Air quality, brightness, temperature 

and noise levels are monitored in all 

our facilities. We conduct regular noise 

monitoring at our facilities to ensure that 

the level is within the recommended range. 

For all workers in an environment with high 

noise levels, we provide hearing protection 

to reduce their exposure to noise. We also 

conduct audiometric tests regularly for 

all at-risk workers, with follow-up doctor 

consultations where hearing impairments 

were identified.

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


Despite limitations and difficulties due 

to COVID-19, F&amp;N has not compromised 

on employees’ safety trainings. In 2020, 

over 590 employees from FNFS attended 

over 1,430 hours of Occupational Health 

and Safety (“OHS”) training, while over 

120 employees from F&amp;NCM benefited 

from over 1,290 hours of training. F&amp;N’s 

safety training topics covered in FY2020 

included:

• Fire Prevention and Safety

• Chemical Safety

• First Aid Training and CPR

• Forklift and Reach Truck Operation

• Electrical Safety

• Working at Height

• Hot Work Safety

• Ergonomic Safety

• COVID-19

In Singapore, we have implemented 

SafeEntry to prevent and control the 

transmission of COVID-19 within our 

facilities. SafeEntry is a digital check-in 

system implemented by the Singapore 

government which allows contact tracing 

and identification of COVID-19 clusters. 

All employees and visitors entering F&amp;N’s 

facilities have to scan a specific QR code 

and enter their details before they can 

check-in. 

Our OHS management systems 

incorporate SGSecure – an initiative from 

the Singapore government to sensitise, 

train and mobilise our communities to 

prevent and deal with a terror attack. 

This includes registering an ‘SGSecure 

Rep’ with the Ministry of Manpower 

(“MOM”), reviewing our Standard 

Operating Procedures and conducting 

risk assessments to identify terror risks. 

During 2020, we have also provided 

SGSecure training to our employees to 

increase awareness on how to manage 

our safety and security risks.

In Malaysia and Thailand, F&amp;NHB 

organised regular activities to engage 

employees on safety topics. Some of 

these activities included monthly OHS 

trainings and newsletters, as well as an 

unsafe working conditions programme 

and Unsafe Award to educate and 

encourage workers in identifying 

unsafe behaviours and safety hazards. 

In F&amp;NDT, to prevent the safety 

risks associated with the use of new 

equipment, the relevant employees 

pursued specific safety trainings before 

commencing high-risk work, such 

as pre-employment risk assessment 

activities, Behaviour Based Safety and 

Kiken Yochi Training activities, and Job 

Safety Analysis’ writing assignments. 

F&amp;NDT was audited to evaluate any 

Unsafe Action and Unsafe Condition at 

work. Corrective actions to implement 

and safety planning recommendations 

were provided in audit reports.

All workers (employees and contractors) 

have access to occupational health 

services in relation to their relevant 

activities. This includes hygiene, 

ergonomics, protective equipment,  

and first aid kits. Accredited consultants 

advise F&amp;N on OHS matters.  

For example, FNFS is advised by 

Concord Associates who is accredited 

by both the Singapore Workplace 

Safety and Health (“WSH”) Council 

and the MOM. The F&amp;N Corporate 

office engages Greensafe International 

Pte Ltd on OHS matters and they are 

similarly accredited by WSH and MOM. 

Where any work-related health matters 

occur, F&amp;N pays relevant treatment 

costs and allows any required time 

away from work.

We offer healthcare insurance to 

employees based on staff category and/

or job levels. Malaysia and Thailand 

offer healthcare for all and we help 

to facilitate good health coverage for 

all workers by organising an annual 

health screening and encouraging all 

employees to participate. Any work-

related illnesses will receive follow-up 

consultations with doctors, if identified.

PERFORMANCE

Our Group LTIFR this year was 3.79 per 

one million hours worked which is above 

our 2020 target of zero LTIFR. 

We have set an ambitious target of zero 

LTIFR to reinforce our stance of zero 

tolerance for workplace accidents. We 

aim to pursue our efforts to achieve 

a zero-accident workplace and will 

continue to emphasise the importance 

we place on our employees’ safety.

APPROACH

Our 137 years of success are built on 

providing products able to earn the trust 

and satisfaction of our consumers, as 

well as enhance their future well-being. 

This requires a holistic approach to safety 

across the life cycle of our products. In 

previous chapters, we have described 

how consumer health is a key part of our 

innovation efforts, and how our supply 

chain processes are a key part of our food 

safety assurance.

In our own operations, we adhere to all 

health and safety regulations applicable 

to the F&amp;B industry for the markets in 

which we operate. All F&amp;N products 

are manufactured under stringent 

international quality and food safety 

standards. Our plants are certified with 

FSSC 22000, ISO 22000 and HACCP 

Food Safety management systems, and 

all stages of our production processes 

are subjected to rigorous quality control 

procedures.

Other certifications include: Quality 

Management System ISO 9001; Accredited 

Laboratory; Good Manufacturing Practice; 

and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 

Point standards. Our SRMC regularly 

reviews our key risks in relation to 

Consumer Health and Safety.

We are committed to providing the 

highest quality products and ensuing 

product integrity. From manufacturing to 

distribution and storage, we protect the 

entire product lifecycle. In the ‘Packaging’ 

chapter, we also described how our 

product packaging and labelling are 

designed to ensure our consumers’ health 

and safety.

In addition to packaging, storage and 

distribution of products are important to 

maintain product integrity. Our Singapore 

production facility follows strict standard 

of operation procedures so that all our 

products are stored and transported 

in acceptable conditions, such as the 

appropriate temperature range, lighting 

and stress on packages. F&amp;NCM in 

Malaysia also engages with third party 

experts on cold storages and distribution 

to ensure supply chain security and 

integrity and maintain product quality. 

They also conduct annual audits to ensure 

that their storage and distribution are of 

the highest standards.

As we value our customers’ satisfaction, 

giving them multiple communication 

channels to provide feedback is critical to 

F&amp;N’s customer experience. Customers can 

contact us through our product website 

or by sending us an email with their 

enquiries. We have also set up accounts on 

social media, such as Facebook and Line, 

for customers to stay connected with us 

and keep up to date with our products. 

In Singapore, we have set up a hotline for 

customers to contact us directly with their 

enquiries.

Safety and Well-being

Consumers’ Health and Safety during 

COVID-19

F&amp;N has taken proactive measures to 

address the impacts of the pandemic on 

the health and safety of our consumers. 

During the lockdown, we worked closely 

with key retailers to ensure that core 

products such as canned and UHT milk, 

or water, were sufficiently stocked and 

available for purchase by our consumers. 

In Singapore, we set up a ‘contactless’ 

distribution network through vending 

machines to supply essential products, 

such as masks, ready-to-eat meals and 

fresh milk, at locations closest to where 

people reside to encourage minimal 

commuting.

At F&amp;N, we aim to offer products, 

which, together with an active 

lifestyle, can play an important role in 

keeping people healthy. Our product 

development team responded to 

consumer demands for healthy, immune 

building products with the launch of 

new products to boost consumers’ 

immune system, like our SUNKIST Pure 

Juice Drink containing vitamins A,  

C and E, and reinforce F&amp;N’s offering  

of zero and low-sugar beverages.  

We also introduced our OYOSHI 

Gold tea beverage which is rich in 

antioxidants. It is prepared by infusing 

whole tea leaves in hot water.

We have taken steps to keep our 

consumers healthy and aware of the 

importance of staying active and 

hydrated during this time. In Singapore, 

we rolled out a Circuit Breaker 

Campaign “STAY FIT with 100PLUS” 

fronted by 100PLUS Active and Original 

which included:

1. Live workout sessions in 

collaboration with SportSG 

consisting of two sessions per 

day with different intensity levels 

between March and July.

2. Live workout sessions from Monday 

to Friday, led by five different 

professional trainers offering 

different sport and intensity options: 

yoga, barre, HIIT, Cardio, Strength, 

Body Weighting.

3. Live weekend workout sessions 

held by celebrities who keep 

their relationships going by 

working out together, virtually 

(#Flattenthecurveby staying apart).

Apart from engaging consumers through 

live workout, we strove to empower our 

audience in an always-on approach to 

staying active and fit. Home workout 

tips &amp; tricks featuring fitness influencers 

and offering various intensities including 

cardio, weights and yoga, were hosted 

on the 100PLUS website.



In Malaysia, we implemented a wider 

range of activities to encourage a healthy 

lifestyle during lockdown. F&amp;NHB also 

conducted virtual fitness challenges 

with athletes and influencers to engage 

consumers. In Thailand, F&amp;NDT helped 

consumers to stay fit and healthy during 

COVID-19 by sharing healthy cooking tips 

and recipes using social media platforms, 

including information on keeping a 

healthy diet during lockdown.

Halal Assurance

All our products are halal certified by 

JAKIM and other relevant authorised 

certification bodies. Each of our 

manufacturing plants has a Halal 

Committee, responsible for halal 

compliance in our supply chain (from 

materials selection and purchasing, to the 

storage, warehousing, and transportation 

of our products).

During the year, in Malaysia, F&amp;NHB’s 

employees with responsibility in Halal 

matters attended a series of professional 

training sessions related to Halal internal 

audit and assurance. A total of over 950 

employees attended Halal training.  

Six virtual classes on Halal awareness for 

new joiners were conducted for over 

70 employees. The Halal awareness 

training was also conducted for 14 of our 

transporters in 2020.

Additionally, F&amp;N prohibits non-halal 

food and drinks within factory premises 

including offices and canteens.

Nutrition Charter

F&amp;N is on a continuous journey to 

develop products and initiatives that 

promote consumers’ health, well-being 

and nutrition, while maintaining a high 

quality of taste. The F&amp;N Nutrition Charter 

outlines our commitment to develop 

products that are healthy for consumers 

and guides us throughout products 

development. The principles of the 

Nutrition Charter are:

1. F&amp;N product developments are led 

by our group philosophy of “Pure 

Enjoyment. Pure Goodness” – our 

commitment to consumers that we 

will deliver products that are not only 

great-tasting but also packed with 

nutritional goodness;

2. To develop products based on proven 

scientific evidence and research, and 

consumer insights and tastes relevant 

to evolving Asian lifestyles;

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


Our philosophy of ‘Pure Enjoyment. 

Pure Goodness’ means that F&amp;N has a 

responsibility to provide high quality, 

healthy, safe and reliable products to its 

consumers. For example, OYOSHI tea 

products are brewed from high quality 

organic tea leaves; our soya bean milk 

is made with first grade non-Genetically 

Modified Organisms soybeans; and none 

of our products sold in Malaysia and 

Thailand contain Partially Hydrogenated 

Oils (‘trans fatty acids’). We provide 

alternative and healthier options by 

innovating our products for consumers 

with food intolerances, such as lactose 

free milk.

Another aspect of the healthier offering 

is our commitment to reducing sugar 

content in our products. &gt;35% of our 

RTD products contain less than 5g/100ml 

of sugar. This includes:

1. Full range of 100PLUS RTD variants

2. Full range of F&amp;N Fun Flavours 

Carbonated Soft Drinks, except F&amp;N 

Mixer

3. F&amp;N SEASONS Asian Drinks

4. F&amp;N SEASONS Soya

Since 2004, F&amp;N has taken deliberate 

steps in reducing the sugar content in 

our beverages. Today, we are pleased 

to report a reduction of 56% in sugar

across our range of beverages. This also 

represents a 17% reduction against  

last year.

Similarly, in Singapore, F&amp;N also 

continues to support the Singapore 

Government’s Sugar Reduction 

Commitment Initiative by:

1. Ensuring that all our RTD beverages 

contain less than 12g/100ml of 

sugar.

2. Continuing to innovate, renovate 

and promote beverages with lower 

sugar content.

Towards Healthier Options

We put much emphasis on developing healthier products, such as by adding vitamins and minerals to boost products’ 

benefits. Many of our products carry the ‘Healthier Choice’ Symbol or Logo:

Safety and Well-being

PERFORMANCE

In FY2020, F&amp;N maintained our health 

and safety standards with no significant 

incidents of non-compliance with 

regulations resulting in a fine, penalty or 

warning.

We made good progress towards our 

2020 target of offering at least one 

Healthier Choice in each RTD product 

category. We currently offer healthier 

options in 14 out of 15 (93%) product 

categories. We currently do not have a 

healthier option available for the ‘Energy’ 

product category as we believe that 

reducing the sugar level of our energy 

drinks too drastically would result in a 

loss of its functionality and purpose, 

which is to provide our consumers, who 

require it, with an energy boost.

Packaging and labelling are the primary 

means by which F&amp;N communicates 

information related to its products’ 

quality, nutrition, safety and disposal to 

consumers. Displaying appropriate, clear 

and accurate information on products’ 

packaging and labelling is therefore 

essential to ensure customers’ trust in 

F&amp;N products and allow them to make 

informed purchasing decisions.

APPROACH

Our labelling adheres to Singapore Food 

Regulations as well as to the guidelines set 

down by SFA. We adhere to the Food Act 

in Malaysia and all requirements of the 

Food and Drug Administration in Thailand. 

All information disclosed on our labels 

is subject to a review process involving a 

range of internal experts including our 

R&amp;D and Scientific &amp; Regulatory Affairs 

teams, plus dietician advice. Labels are 

then submitted to government authorities 

for verification and endorsement.

At F&amp;N, as we believe that information 

provided to customers should be as 

comprehensive as possible, we go 

beyond mandatory requirements. For 

all products, we provide information on 

ingredients, sourcing, energy per serving 

size, recommended daily allowances of 

the different nutritional components, 

expiry dates and nutrition tips.

Fundamental information (such 

as calories and contribution to 

recommended daily caloric intake) is 

included in “front of pack labelling”, 

for most of our ready-to-drink products, 

to provide consumers with easy-to-

understand data.  

We take care to ensure that our marketing 

and advertising activities do not violate 

any ethical standards. We adhere to the 

Malaysian Code of Advertising Practice in 

Malaysia and the Consumer Protection Act 

of B.E. 2522 (1979) in Thailand.

In Malaysia, we are a signatory to the 

‘Responsible Advertising to Children’ 

initiative and have pledged to restrict 

marketing to children under 12 years  

of age.

PERFORMANCE

There were no fines or penalties for 

breaches recorded in this year.  

In FY2020, there were no instances 

of non-compliance with regulations 

concerning product labelling and 

packaging, and no breaches of 

advertising law were reported.

All our product categories comply with 

product labelling requirements as below:

The sourcing 

of components 

of the product 

or service

Content, particularly 

regarding substances 

that might produce 

an environmental or 

social impact

Safe use of  

the product  

or service

Disposal of the 

product and 

environmental/ 

social impacts; and

Others

1. In 2020, our target for Water Stewardship was to reduce the Group water intensity at our plants across the Group by 5% from 

2017 by 2020. In FY2020, we saw an increase by about 18% on our Group water intensity ratio as compared to FY2017.

2. We have also met our target for Effluents and Waste to reduce the Group solid waste intensity ratio by 5% across the Group 

from 2017 in FY2020. We have achieved a reduction of around 47% on our Group solid waste intensity ratio as compared to 

FY2017.

3. Our targets for Energy and Climate Change was to reduce the Group energy and GHG emissions intensity ratios by 5% 

between 2017 and 2020. Our Group energy and GHG emissions intensity ratios have increased by about 0.3% and 2% as 

compared to FY2017.

Independent Assurance Statement











 

 

 



LR Independent Assurance Statement 

Relating to Fraser and Neave, Limited’s data for selected GRI 

indicators for the fiscal year 2020 (1st October 2019 – 30th 

September 2020) 

 

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Fraser and Neave, Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended 

for the readers of this Report.  

 

Terms of engagement 

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (LR) was commissioned by Fraser and Neave, Limited (F&amp;N), to provide independent 

assurance on its selected GRI indicators (“the data”) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at 

the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LR’s verification procedure. LR’s verification procedure is 

based on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 30001 and uses the following principles of - inclusivity, materiality, 

responsiveness and reliability of performance data. 

 

Our assurance engagement covered F&amp;N’s operations and activities in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand specifically the 

following requirements: 

• 

Confirming whether the selected economic, environmental and social indicators below were compiled according 

to GRI’s Standard 2016. 

• 

Evaluating the reliability of data and information for only the selected environmental and social indicators listed 

below: 

Economic:  

 

- GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed 

Environmental 

-  GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization 

- GRI 302-3 Energy intensity 

- GRI 303-3 (2018 edition) Water withdrawal 

- GRI 303-4 (2018 edition) Water discharge 

- GRI 303-5 (2018 edition) Water consumption 

- GRI 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions 

- GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions 

- GRI 305-4 GHG emissions intensity 

- GRI 306-2 Waste by type and disposal method 

Social 

-   GRI 403-8 (2018 edition) Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system 

- GRI 403-9 (2018 edition) Work-related injuries 

- GRI 403-10 (2018 edition) Work-related ill health 

- GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee 

- GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews 

- GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs 

 

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of F&amp;N’s suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned 

in the report. 

 

LR’s responsibility is only to F&amp;N.  LR disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. F&amp;N’s 

responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the report and for 

maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived.  Ultimately, the report has been 

approved by, and remains the responsibility of F&amp;N.

Fraser and Neave, Limited &amp; Subsidiary Companies  Sustainability Report 2020


 

Lloyd's Register Group Limited, its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (LRQA), and their respective 

officers, employees or agents are, individually and collectively, referred to in this clause as 'Lloyd's Register'. Lloyd's Register assumes no 

responsibility and shall not be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense caused by reliance on the information or advice in this 

document or howsoever provided, unless that person has signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd's Register entity for the provision of this 

information or advice and in that case any responsibility or liability is exclusively on the terms and conditions set out in that contract. 

The English version of this Assurance Statement is the only valid version. Lloyd’s Register Group Limited assumes no responsibility for versions 

translated into other languages.  

 

This Assurance Statement is only valid when published with the Report to which it refers. It may only be reproduced in its entirety.

LR’s Opinion 

Based on LR’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that F&amp;N has not, in all material 

respects: 

• 

Met the requirements above 

• 

Disclosed reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected 

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional 

judgement of the verifier.  

Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement.  Limited 

assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.  Consequently, the level of assurance 

obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable 

assurance engagement been performed.  

 

LR’s approach 

LR’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure.  The following tasks though were 

undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement: 

• 

Auditing F&amp;N’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or mis-

statements in the data.  We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and 

systems, including those for internal verification.  We also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling the 

data and drafting the report. 

• 

Sampling the selected GRI indicators (FNDM and Times Offset Printing Plants in Malaysia, FNDT Plant in Thailand). 

We also reviewed how these selected GRI indicators from the operations in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand were 

consolidated into the final reported data. 

 

Observations  

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are: 

• 

Reliability: Data management systems are established and centralized for the data and information collection and 

calculation associated with the selected GRI indicators. However, we believe that F&amp;N should work closer with supply 

chain to improve the quality and reliability of data reported in the future, typically for reporting of waste circularity. 

 

LR’s standards, competence and independence 

LR ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The 

outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the 

approach applied is rigorous and transparent. 

 

This verification is the only work undertaken by LR for F&amp;N and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
