CDW HOLDING LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

This is the first Sustainability Report published by 

CDW. By reporting the policies, practices, targets 

and performances of the Group in terms of the 

material environmental, social and governmental 

factors, it allows all stakeholders to understand 

the progress and development direction of the 

Group.

The report has been uploaded to the websites of 

the Singapore Exchange Limited (the “SGX”) and 

CDW (www.cdw-holding.com.hk). 

REPORTING BOUNDARY

This report focuses on the operation of CDW’s 

business segment of LCD backlight units 

between January 2017 and December 2017 (the 

“reporting year”). The reporting boundary covers 

the manufacturing facility in Shanghai managed 

by Crystal Display Components (Shanghai) Co., 

Limited (“CD Shanghai”). While this report does 

not cover all of the Group’s operations, the aim of 

CDW is to consistently upgrade the internal data 

collection procedure and gradually expand the 

scope of disclosure. 

REPORTING STANDARD

This report is prepared in accordance with 

the ‘comply or explain’ provisions of SGX-ST 

Listing Rules 711A (“LR 711A”) on sustainability 

reporting, as well as the guidance set out in 

the Practice Note 7.6: Sustainability Reporting 

Guide (“PN 7.6”) launched by the SGX. The five 

reporting components prescribed by the SGX-

ST Listing Rules 711B (“LR 711B”) underline the 

key structure of this report. It takes reference 

from the sustainability reporting framework 

provided by Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”), 

the GRI Standards (version 2016 and 2018). 

GRI’s Reporting Principles for defining report 

quality – accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, 

reliability, and timeliness – form the backbone of

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 CDW HOLDING LIMITED

BOARD

STATEMENT

In October 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special 

report, which draws the global attention to the 

consequence of failing to limit global warming 

to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures. 

The critical environmental, economic and social 

impacts posed by climate change simply cannot 

be ignored. We believe that sustainability is part of 

the solution.

We are fully aware that sustainability risks and 

opportunities matter to investors and stakeholders 

just as much as other risks and strategies. To 

meet the growing interest in sustainability among 

investors and stakeholders, CDW is proud to 

present its first sustainability report. Our goal is 

to highlight the board’s inclusion of sustainability 

issues as an integral part of CDW’s corporate 

governance, and to set out strategic responses 

to the sustainability risks posed to CDW in a 

transparent and effective manner. 

When preparing for this report, we conducted 

stakeholder engagement exercises with internal 

and 

external 

stakeholders. 

With 

feedback 

collected from stakeholder questionnaires, we 

identified and prioritised critical sustainability 

topics with materiality analysis. This set of material 

topics had been confirmed by the board, including 

six critical topics, and eight important topics. The 

results show that our stakeholders are particularly 

concerned about customer privacy, anti-corruption 

endeavours, as well as compliance with both 

socio-economic and environmental regulations. 

It is hardly surprising that the material topics 

identified resonate with that of the Ten Principles of 

the United Nations Global Compact. We recognise 

that our responsibilities go beyond our products to 

creating benefits for people and communities that 

are affected by our operation. In-depth description 

of our management approaches and practices in 

the critical topics forms the core components of 

this report. 

Taking into account the materiality analysis result, 

the board has further assessed the operations 

and identified potential sustainability risks with 

relevant responses and opportunities. Posed by 

increasing expectations of socially responsible 

conduct, changing values of customers, and the 

more substantial challenges of climate change, 

such risks are discussed in greater detail in each 

relevant section. The board will continue to include 

risk assessment in the strategic planning of CDW 

in order to drive actions in the Group.     

At 

CDW, 

sustainability 

means 

more 

than 

compliance. We have adopted group-level policies 

that govern our practices in relation to quality 

assurance, environmental management, whistle-

blowing mechanism and information security. 

While we have not yet formulated a sustainability 

strategy, the establishment of a sustainability 

committee is on our agenda, which will help us 

better monitor the Group’s sustainability practices 

and steer our business development towards a 

sustainable future.  

Our vision is to become a global leader on 

sustainability directions in the precision component 

industry. We must remain flexible and responsive 

to changing customer demands, to respond 

proactively to the risks facing our industry. We 

firmly believe that our long-term success is 

inextricably linked to our environmental, social and 

governance performance. We aspire to foster ever-

stronger ties with our partners at all levels to pave 

the way for a more sustainable world. This report 

will hopefully serve as a bridge that connects our 

team to all stakeholders in joining our efforts to 

achieve our vision.

GOvERNANCE

CDW’s Board of Directors has established the 

Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee, 

the Remuneration Committee and the Investment 

Committee. The Group has established the 

Information Security Committee to monitor the 

use of customer information and to protect 

customer privacy through its subsidiaries. 

The Environmental Management Committee 

has been established in CD Shanghai at the 

initiative of the General Manager, to coordinate 

the environmental impact assessment, internal 

controls and environmental risk management, as 

well as operational planning. CDW is reviewing 

its current policies in order to subscribe to Core 

Conventions of International Labour Organisation.

ENGAGEMENT

As a key in the management of CDW, stakeholder2 

participation helps the Group review potential 

risks and business opportunities. Communicating 

with stakeholders and understanding their views 

allow the Group to better fulfil their needs and 

expectations with its business practice and 

manage different stakeholders’ opinions. The Group 

constantly communicates with key internal and 

external stakeholders via various channels. This 

ensures that they have the opportunity to learn 

about the Group’s development and operation 

directions and offers the Group the chance to listen 

to them in order to identify the priority of issues and 

develop corresponding policies.

Material sustainability topics in the reporting year

To formulate the Group’s sustainability strategy 

and direction and to identify material sustainability 

topics for the Group and its stakeholders, the 

Group commissioned an independent consultancy 

to conduct a management interview. Combining 

the results of the interview and expert advice, the 

Group selected six critical issues to focus on in this 

report.

CDW HOLDING LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

SUSTAINABIlITy RISkS

AND OPPORTUNITIES

In 

light 

of 

the 

material 

sustainability 

issues 

identified 

from 

the 

stakeholder 

engagement exercise, the Group identifies 

the risks and opportunities in its social, 

environmental and economic challenges. 

The Risk Management Policy set out by the 

Group focuses on identifying efficient and 

responsible measures in response to imminent 

risks.  



Risks

Responses/ Opportunities

Product Responsibilities  

Product safety and health requirements are based on the 

safety standard requirement of the target market. Product 

defect and product safety issues may result in loss of trust 

from customers. As the Group serves a selective range of key 

customers in its LCD backlight unit segment, sustaining their 

trusts and values are of high importance. The operations and 

market positions of the Group can be adversely affected by 

issues about product responsibilities. 

Product Quality Assurance 

The Group established and implemented the Non-

Conforming Product Control Procedure. In case any non-

conforming product is identified, the Group shall isolate the 

product concerned from the sales inventory. Corrective and 

preventive actions will then be undertaken, which include 

product rework upon confirmation by client, procedural 

optimisation and staff training.

Technology

The Group can be outpaced in technology development of 

the industry. Heavier automation in production line and more 

cost-effective way of quality management advanced in the 

free market are pushing the Group to continuously reform its 

production system. The Group relies on specific suppliers, 

while the technical capacities of these existing suppliers are 

not sufficient.

Product Development and Research

The Group continues to strengthen its research and 

development capacity to maintain its technological leadership 

in the industry and to explore new market segment. CDW 

is also exploring broader spectrum of customer needs in 

search for opportunities to diversify its customer portfolio. 

New products and marketing plans are being developed to 

cater for changing demands of the customers. 

Socially Responsible Conducts

In the age of more transparent media and public 

communication, any form of misconduct of established 

businesses can go spread rapidly at the expense of 

companies’ public image. Malpractice in employment (e.g. 

discrimination, harassments, child labour, or forced labour) 

can significantly reduce morale and lead to talent drain. 

Incidents of socioeconomic non-compliance (e.g. corruption 

and labour issues) threaten business reputation, dispel 

investors, and affect customer trust, which may also result in 

lengthy litigation and monetary sanctions. 

Corporate Social Responsibility Management 

The Group can set up an active monitoring system to 

identify the changing social norms, legal requirements, and 

administrative regulations in different areas of operations. 

The Sustainability Committee to be established by the Group 

will steer the strategic management of business conduct and 

corporate social responsibility activities, so as to provide 

timely responses to changing needs of the stakeholders and 

local communities. 

Occupational Hazards

Workers in the production line are at risk of exposure to 

chemicals known to be hazardous to human health. Regular 

practices of hazard identification and provision of personal 

protective equipment are essential to protecting the health 

and safety of the employees.

Safety Management System

The Group can implement a safety management system 

to control the risk associated with occupational health and 

safety hazards, so as to further reduce the rate of work-

related injuries and ill health. Work safety education and staff 

wellbeing activities are regularly organised. 




9

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 CDW HOLDING LIMITED

SUSTAINABIlITy RISkS

AND OPPORTUNITIES



Risks

Responses/ Opportunities

Talent Loss

Employees are key contributors to value creation in the 

industry. Manufacturers face increasing challenges in 

recruiting and retaining qualified employees. 

Employer Branding  

The Group has put in place policies and an annual plan for 

training and education and to enhance employee welfare by 

adjusting its human resources policies.

Climate Change

GHG emissions from manufacturing facilities constitute a 

significant source of risk to current and future operations. 

International trends of stringent regulatory requirements to 

combat climate change would pose regulatory risk to the 

Group. Manufacture of LCD backlight unit is an energy-

intensive process. Fossil-fuel based energy consumption 

creates significant environmental impacts. More frequent heat 

stress caused by climate change can reduce productivity of 

employees and put further pressure on energy consumption 

for extra use of air conditioning. Rise in sea-levels increases 

flood risks to the Group’s production facility, which is located 

in the coastal area (i.e. Shanghai). 

Energy and Resource Efficiency 

The Group strives to enhance energy and resource efficiency 

and adopt new technologies to reduce the operating costs 

and GHG Emission. The Environmental Management System 

has been deployed to monitor the emissions, consumption, 

and waste materials of the production facility. 

Alternative Energy Sources

The Group may benefit from opportunities offered by new 

types of energy supplies around the operation areas, and 

be able to utilise policy incentives for energy efficiency and 

renewable energy. 

Regional Water Stress/ Drought

The Group’s production process consumes a significant 

amount of ultra-pure water. Reduction of water use is a major 

challenge to the Group, while increasing global water stress 

could pose operational risks.

Water Management 

The Group has established procedures for recycling and 

reusing the withdrawn water to reduce pressure on local 

water sources. In the Environmental Management System of 

CD Shanghai, water consumption is closely monitored. 

Pollution and environmental contamination

Regulatory controls on pollutants have been increasingly 

tightened. As the production process involves the use of 

chemicals, there are risks of contamination in the surrounding 

communities.   

Pollution Control System

The Group has been proactively managing its level of 

potential pollution in the production process. We maintained 

communication with local stakeholders and have set up an 

emergency response plan. 








10

CDW HOLDING LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

CDW complies with ethical standards in its 

business operation and value chain. The main 

products of CD Shanghai are LCD backlight units 

for in-vehicle information display and for various 

models of gaming device. CD Shanghai has 

established a set of quality assurance procedures 

to ensure the protection of customer privacy and 

customer rights. It also follows CDW’s Whistle-

blowing Policy to prevent corruption in its 

operational practices. 

Product deliveries of CDW rely on the integrity 

of its procurement practices. To provide quality 

products and services, it actively monitors 

the performance of its suppliers with a rating, 

reporting, and verification system. Suppliers 

are required to render production part approval 

process (PPAP) verification reports. The major 

suppliers of the Group continue to be Japanese-

based manufacturers due to specific and 

high quality standard required by the Group’s 

customers.  

PROTECTING CUSTOMER PRIVACY

The Group invests resources in maintaining its 

information security infrastructure, and seeks 

to protect the privacy of its customers. The 

provisional Information Security Policy sets out 

our management approaches to data security, 

and recommends the appointment of an 

information officer of the Group. 

CD Shanghai’s Quality Manual released in 

the reporting year has prescribed procedures 

to prevent loss, damage or improper use of 

information of customers and external suppliers. 

The editing, storage, modification and disposal 

of customer specification documents are 

governed by the Document Control Procedures 

and the Record Control Procedures. In written 

contracts with customers, CD Shanghai pledges 

to protect customers’ intellectual property rights 

(including business secrets and know-hows) 

and exercise the duty of confidentiality towards 

customer information. During the reporting year 

at CD Shanghai, there were no incidents of 

substantiated complaints6 received concerning 

breaches of customer privacy, whether from 

outside parties and substantiated by CDW, 

or from regulatory bodies. There were also no 

incidents of identified leaks, thefts, or loses of 

customer data.    

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

The Group’s Whistle-blowing Policy and 

Procedure, together with CD Shanghai’s Staff 

Manual, set out detailed arrangement for anti-

corruption practices. The anti-corruption 

provision in the Staff Manual prohibits any 

requests for off-the-book commission rebates 

in business transactions with external parties. 

Employees are encouraged to report any 

suspected financial improprieties through the 

confidential whistle-blowing mechanism. There 

were no confirmed incidents of corruption or 

any legal cases regarding corruption brought 

against CD Shanghai or its employees during the 

reporting year.

CUSTOMER RIGHTS

Customer Health and Safety

CDW affirms customers’ rights to health and 

safety, while CD Shanghai has executed 

product safety measures in accordance with 

its Strategic Control Procedures of Products 

Implementation. Aligned with the customers’ 

specific requirements, the Group prescribes 

proper assembly of products to prevent health 

and safety incidents in the production line, the 

storage facilities and during transportation. 

In the development of new products, the ISO 

Management Office of CD Shanghai identifies 

and communicates the laws and regulations 

in relation to product safety, assesses and 

controls the features of product safety, as well 

as evaluates the potential impacts of alteration of 

production process on product safety. 

ETHICAl

OPERATIONS

6 

A substantiated complaint refers to written statement by regulatory or similar official body addressed to CDW that identifies breaches of 

customer privacy, or a complaint lodged with CDW that has been recognised as legitimate by CDW. 




11

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 CDW HOLDING LIMITED

ETHICAl

OPERATIONS

Marketing and Labelling

Customers’ rights to fair information is essential 

to maintaining satisfactory partnerships. Although 

the existing customers of CD Shanghai are 

managed by the headquarter or the Group’s office 

in Japan, CD Shanghai has worked on monitoring 

client needs, evaluating market intelligence and 

feedback, as well as executing marketing plan.  

In the product development stage, CD Shanghai 

ensures effective communication with the 

customers to avoid misinformation.  

The Group abides by laws and regulations 

in relation to ethical operations, such as the 

Contract Law, Trademark Law, and Patent Law 

of the People’s Republic of China. During the 

reporting year, concerning product health and 

safety, information and labelling, as well as 

marketing and labelling, there were no cases of 

non-compliance with regulations or voluntary 

codes that resulted in a fine, a penalty, or a 

warning against the Group.      

Going forward in 2018, CD Shanghai is going 

to follow up with a set of targets for ethical 

operations:

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

CDW cares about the health and safety of its 

employees. The Group’s Risk Management 

Policy promotes appropriate risk management 

to prevent damage in the safety and wellbeing 

of all employees. CD Shanghai regularly checks 

for possible occupational hazards in the working 

environment, such as hazardous chemical 

substances for code printing works. To prevent 

work-related ill health, CD Shanghai arranges 

annual body checks for its employees and 

regular inspections of the air ventilation system. 

The manufacturing facility in Shanghai has been 

accredited with a Certificate in Work Safety 

Standardisation for Light Industry from the State 

Administration of Work Safety in China.  

The Group abides by laws and regulations 

concerning occupational health and safety, such 

as the Prevention and Control of Occupational 

Diseases and the Regulation on Work-Related 

Injury Insurance.  During the reporting year, there 

was one case of work-related injury and no work-

related ill health was reported. The injury was 

due to an accident in switching light bulb. The 

injured worker was given immediate medical care 

and sufficient time for recovery. Compensation 

was offered in accordance with the regulations 

of Implementation Procedures of Shanghai 

Municipality on Industrial Injury Insurance. 

LABOUR STANDARDS 

Eliminating Child Labour

CDW supports the Minimum Age Convention 

and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention 

of the International Labor Organisation. As 

stipulated in the Staff Manual, CD Shanghai 

prohibits recruitment of employees under the age 

of 16.    

Avoiding Forced or Compulsory Labour

Employees at CDW are contracted on a voluntary 

and fair basis. To prevent forced labour, any 

overtime working arrangement requires prior 

mutual agreement between the employees and 

their supervisors. If overtime work is required, 

employees will be compensated with leave or 

allowance.  

Non-discrimination

The Quality Manual prescribes CD Shanghai to 

provide a workplace free of discrimination and 

psychological pressure. During the reporting year, 

there were no reported incidents of discrimination

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCES 

Water and Effluents

To regulate proper water use, the Energy and 

Resource Management Procedures prescribes 

regular water system checks and usage 

monitoring. The General Affairs Department 

conducts installation, servicing and maintenance 

of water supplies system. Monthly reports on 

water consumption are generated and monitored 

for irregularities. In the reporting year, CD 

Shanghai’s manufacturing facility used 45.0 mega 

litres of freshwater8 in total.  

CD Shanghai’s Pollution Control Procedures 

regulate the supervision of effluent discharge. 

It prohibits storage of chemicals, oil products 

and wastes near the sewage pipe network, 

or dumping of chemical wastes therein. The 

production departments are not allowed to 

discharge industrial or domestic effluents into 

rain water pipelines. Domestic effluents are 

discharged into municipal sewage treatment 

system. As required in the Environmental 

Monitoring and Measurement Management 

Procedures, CD Shanghai has commissioned a 

qualified third-party environmental testing agency 

to conduct annual monitoring of the effluent 

discharge points.

There had been no changes in water storage in 2017.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

The Group abides by environmental laws and 

regulations, such as the Environmental Protection 

Law of the People’s Republic of China, as well as 

the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the 

Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution 

by Solid Waste, Law of the People’s Republic of 

China on the Prevention and Control of Water 

Pollution, and Law of the People’s Republic 

of China on the Prevention and Control of 

Atmospheric Pollution. To facilitate environmental 

compliance, CD Shanghai’s Environmental 

Management Manual specifies responsibilities to 

meet expectations of governmental regulators, 

local communities, and neighbouring enterprises 

on emissions, wastes, and effluent discharges. 

It requires that mandates of environmental 

laws and regulations must be considered in the 

identification of important environmental factors.  

The ISO Management Office is responsible 

for establishing feedback channels, to collect, 

confirm and provide updates on environmental 

laws and regulations in a timely manner, to 

evaluate the impacts on operations, and to 

circulate the updates to employees through 

each department. An inventory of applicable 

environmental laws and regulations, and other 

administrative requirements has been composed 

as the basis for the feedback channel. During 

the reporting year, there were no cases of 

non-compliance with environmental laws or 

regulations in CD Shanghai, and no significant 

spill was observed.

The GHG assessment covers five types of GHGs, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), hydroflurocarbons (HFCs), perflurocarbons (PFCs), 

sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC); whereas “operational control” is chosen as the consolidation approach 

for emissions.

Waste

The generation and treatment of both hazardous 

and non-hazardous waste could pose harm 

to the environment. CDW considers waste 

management as an important concern and strictly 

follows the national regulations to handle its 

waste. The Solid Waste Management Procedures 

of CD Shanghai prescribes practices of waste 

classification, collection, storage management, 

and outsourced treatment. Recyclable non-

hazardous waste (e.g. paper products, plastic 

waste) are sorted and transported to the waste 

recycling station, which are documented in a 

Solid Waste Removal Record. 

The Environmental Management Committee 

supervises the outsourced treatment of 

hazardous waste. The hazardous waste collection 

contractor must be approved by the Environment 

Protection Bureau of the local government. 

Record of hazardous waste collection needs 

to be kept for five years in the Environmental 

Management Committee. In the reporting year, 

major non-hazardous waste includes thin films 

and food waste from the manufacturing facility 

of CD Shanghai, and major hazardous waste 

includes toner/ink cartridges, fluorescent tubes, 

and grease trap precipitate.

Emissions 

GHG Emissions

Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, or carbon 

emissions, are closely related to climate change 

and global warming. As such, companies around 

the world are doing their part to develop their 

own carbon reduction measures and targets. In 

the reporting year, CDW engaged an external 

consultancy, Carbon Care Asia, to quantify the 

GHG emissions from its operations in Shanghai 

through carbon assessment. The quantification 

of GHG emissions9 took reference from the 

Guidelines10 released by the National Development 

and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the People’s 

Republic of China as well as ISO 14064-1. The 

assessment process allows CDW to better 

understand the use of resources and develop 

specific action plans to enhance efficiency and 

develop its carbon reduction target.

CDW HOLDING LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

In 2017, the total GHG emissions of the Shanghai 

manufacturing facility was approximately 

2,018 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, of which 87% 

is indirect emissions from the generation of 

purchased electricity. CDW will continue to 

assess, record and disclose its GHG emissions 

annually. CDW will use this reporting year’s 

results as a baseline for comparison against 

results of the coming years, which will form the 

basis for planning its future reduction targets, 

measures and priorities. 

To reduce carbon emissions from energy use, the 

Energy and Resource Management Procedures 

set out proper practices of electricity consumption.  

The Production Department is required to 

conduct monthly examinations on equipment 

to prevent power leakage. The Financial 

Division monitors monthly trends in electricity 

consumption and analyses abnormal conditions.   

Air Emissions

Air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 

sulphur oxides (SOx) have negative impacts on 

air quality, human health and the ecosystem. 

CDW has closely monitored the amount of air 

emissions from its operations and facilities. In the 

reporting year, emissions of air pollutants from 

the operations of CD Shanghai were:
