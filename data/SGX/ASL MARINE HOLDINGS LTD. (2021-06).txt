1 BOARD STATEMENT 

Dear Stakeholders, 

It gives us great pleasure to present our sustainability report for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 

("FY2021”).  In this report, we highlight the performance of our organisation with particular focus on 

our commitment to working alongside our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable business based 

on our experience, resilience and adaptability to the ever changing environment and global economy.  

It is our belief that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we must 

be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our customers, our people and our community 

as well as the Group’s financial performance.  The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of 

our ability to remain financially stable. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to 

principles laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that 

sustainable practices are incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the needs not 

only of our customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also those of our 

environment and our future generations.  

 

This report provides detail about how we have met our responsibilities with our key stakeholders 

during the FY2021 and beyond. 

 

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. The report is 

designed to provide a transparent and balanced view of ASL Marine Holdings Ltd. (the “Company”) 

and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders, and to address those 

interests pragmatically. This report aims to include comprehensive and accessible information on the 

Company’s strategy towards sustainability, key issues as well as data according to recognized 

standards.  

2.1 Report Scope 

The report covers the performance of our consolidated entities in FY2021 from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 

2021. The content of this report will focus on the sustainability performance, activities and initiatives 

that are under our direct control, including our Singapore office and operations, our local supply chain 

as well as any overseas activities directly associated with us. This report excludes joint ventures and 

associated companies which are not directly under our control. Material issues and topics described in 

this report have been selected according to their level of significance within the company boundaries, 

the sustainability context and the expectations of stakeholders which are reflective of our core 

business in a consistent manner for comparability of our performance indicators across time. In this 

respect, this report covers our core businesses in our major offices located in Singapore (head office) 

and Indonesia. Nevertheless, our corporate governance and sustainability approaches are drawn from 

the policies and practices set at Group level. 

This sustainability report focuses on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices whilst 

highlighting the economic, environmental, and social and governance aspects of our activities and 

developments. The report aims to provide an overview of our approach, priorities and targets, as well 

as a performance review for our key sustainability areas.  

2.2 Report Methodology

management approaches that govern how our material issues are identified as well as how the issues 

are prioritized and managed. Further, we will present our initiatives relating to sustainability in the 

areas of environmental, social and economic issues relevant to our aspects and boundaries. Finally, we 

will provide the information of our key performance indicators, performance targets and outcomes. 

Altogether, this report provides the basis for our responses and disclosures to the GRI-Standards ‘In-

3 CORPORATE PROFILE 

3.1 Vision and Mission

employees. 

Our employees operate according to a set of core values that guide all aspects of our business. We 

recognise that cooperation, communication and trust are essential for us to collaborate to compete,

3.3 Ethics and Compliance 

Being a listed company in the Singapore Exchange (SGX), we are committed to maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance as required in the listing rules. Our corporate governance 

framework covers ethics and compliance through a Code of Conduct as well as action guidelines which

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

We believe corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. Such 

responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the core values in our 

corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes across the value 

chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. We hope to play a part in influencing 

the environment for our future generations. Through integrating the notion of sustainability in our 

business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are in line with a long-term vision 

towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

The Group is a vertically integrated marine services group primarily engaged in shipbuilding, shiprepair 

and conversion, shipchartering, dredge engineering and other marine related services to a broad base

For more information, please refer to our latest Annual Report for Corporate Profile and Business 

Overview.  

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We performed 

an analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder mapping and 

materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder groups within our 

sustainability context and their respective material issues are to be shown in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a review, assessment and feedback process in relation to Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) topics. The key to this is our Risk Assessment and Control Self-Assessment exercise 

which entails the identification, assessment and documentation of material risks and corresponding 

internal controls. Such material risks include fraud and corruption, environmental, health and safety, 

and human capital risks which are ESG-relevant. We are continuously improving the adequacy and 

effectiveness of our Risk Assessment and Control Self-Assessment processes in response to changing 

business and operation environment. 

Through stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are most relevant and 

significant to us and our stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority is given to issues important 

to society and applicable to us. Then, we prioritize our sustainability efforts and report issues that are 

most material to its business and stakeholders. Considering that specific stakeholders and material 

issues are specific in countries and locations, we are reporting the stakeholder engagement and 

material issues for our Singapore and Indonesia operations in this report.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (UN), the General Assembly occupies a 

central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. 

Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for multilateral 

discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also plays a significant 

role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable 

development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years. Although 

the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important opportunity for businesses 

to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the guiding principles for our 

sustainability initiatives. 

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals.

SDG Goal 

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses 

(Source: 

http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) 

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising 

and human and institutional capacity on 

climate change mitigation, adaptation, 

impact reduction and early warning. 

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity 

and fuel consumption. Our approach to 

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our GHG 

emissions and set reduction targets. 

 

15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, 

restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial 

and inland freshwater ecosystems and their 

services, in particular forests, wetlands, 

mountains and drylands, in line with 

obligations under international agreements. 

All the paper used in our offices are either 

Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified or 

made from KHAN-NA. We actively promote 

the 

use 

of 

such 

papers 

across 

our 

organisation. Through that, the Company 

supports efforts in mitigating global warming 

and the creation of positive rural community 

engagement, job opportunity, and better 

livelihood for the farmers and members of the 

community.

carried out across the organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We do not believe these goals are relevant to our 

business or industry. They are not within our 

boundaries and scope of influence; therefore, we 

are currently unable to make noticeable 

contributions to such goals.

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We believe that good Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) practice goes hand-in-hand with good 

corporate management practice. We also recognize that it is vital that our management approaches 

are adaptable to the dynamics of business and operation environment in such a way that we can 

continuously assess our impacts, develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner to 

meet our stakeholders’ expectations. Our CSR framework is based on our approach to sustainability 

and includes policies and measurement mechanisms to monitor the impacts made by our businesses 

and operations. 

The key to the success of our sustainability programme is regular communication about our CSR plan 

and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of appropriate feedback mechanisms so that 

we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and explore new possibilities stimulated by 

stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability reports as being a critical component of 

communication and evaluation. The overall sustainability context of the stakeholder engagements is 

managed through our CSR plan for our sustainability governance oversight.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 

Our Approach 

We are committed to maintaining and building on the same stringent environmental policies and 

standards across the Group. We continually seek new and innovative ways to reduce the 

environmental impact of our products and services while maintaining the good quality. We recognise 

our responsibility to protect the environment for the health and wellbeing of future generations.  

5.1.2 

Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that the effective management and monitoring of its carbon footprint can reduce 

operating costs, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon footprint is 

measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute 

measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly 

indirect (Scope 2) emission. We have insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do not include the 

GHG emissions generated by our suppliers (Scope 3). 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a target 

for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 10% from our 2018 level by 2030. Our target for GHG 

emission improvement is 0.8% per year. Although various business lines and operations account for 

different percentage of GHG emissions across the organization, they all support this target and have 

aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

In FY2021, our GHG Carbon emission index stands at 0.74 (FY2020: 0.61) tonnes-CO2 per SGD million 

of revenue. 

5.1.3 

Reduction of Paper Consumption 

All our employees are urged to minimize paper wastage at work by adhering to our Internal Paper 

Usage Reduction Guidelines. For example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage 

paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used for printing 

drafts. Paper re-use and recycling habits are also cultivated through initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the copy machines. 

All waste paper from our own offices is collected for recycling. Further, we encourage all employees 

to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper 

consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set a 

target for a paper consumption improvement of 10% from our 2018 level by 2030. Our target for paper 

consumption improvement is 0.8% per year. Although various business lines and operations account 

for different percentage of paper consumption across the organization, they all support this target and 

have aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

In FY2021, we consumed total of 5,787 (FY2020: 6,668) kg of paper, 100% of which are either 

Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) certified or made from KHAN-NA. Our 

paper consumption index stands at 31.26 (FY2020: 27.95) kg per SGD million of revenue. 

5.1.4 

Promoting Green Practices  

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation such as ISO 14001. 

The ISO 14000 family of standards provides practical tools for companies and organizations of all kinds 

looking to manage their environmental responsibilities. ISO 14001:2015 sets out the criteria for an 


 

 

 

 



Page 14 of 26 

 

environmental management system and can be certified to. It maps out a framework that a company 

or organization can follow to set up an effective environmental management system. It can be used 

by any organization regardless of its activity or sector. Using ISO 14001:2015 provides assurance to our 

management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental impact is being 

measured and improved. 

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 

Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and personal well-being 

is vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, which 

are in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the foundation upon which we build all 

our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day activities.  

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all our key 

stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the members of the community. Such commitment 

to our employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality and trust within the organization 

which reflect in our ability to create values to our stakeholders. 

Our Human Resource (HR) management principles and policies have been developed and established 

based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, supporting and maintaining a 

motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, health and 

safety, career development and training.  

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and geographic 

locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the organization within the 

principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing laws and regulations as well as 

local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

5.2.2 

Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximizing the strength of our employees by providing equal 

opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through our on-the job 

training. We review the performance and development of our employees to effectively match their 

strength to their job specifications. Our performance based reward scheme provides guidance to our 

employee to perform to their potentials in alignment with the objectives of the Company.  

5.2.2.1 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

Our HR practices are guided by the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment 

Practices (TAFEP). The Singapore Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 

National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has 

formulated guidelines on fair employment practice for adoption by Singapore employers, embracing 

the recruitment, training, treatment and reward of employees.  

5.2.2.2 

Communications  

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organization are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organizational objectives. We achieve 

this through our various communication sessions customized based on target employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held regularly and agendas covered are customized in 

appropriate to the target functional scope of the managers. For example, operational agendas such as 

operation issues, ongoing developments and key project reviews may be discussed.

5.2.2.3 

Employee Feedback  

We value our employee’s expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks are 

important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the organization. Through 

various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee objective setting, 

performance review as well as exit interview in the case of resignations, we gather such valuable 

feedbacks for the continuous improvement of our organization. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as 

health and safety issues and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by the leaders and 

managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also established reporting and 

escalation channel should the feedback require the attention of higher management. 

5.2.2.4 

Career Development and Training 

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance management 

established based on merits and contributing skill sets towards the organization objectives through 

objective settings and regular performance reviews. We continue to review and improve our career 

development and performance review process in light of the changing business and operation 

environment. 

Our training programme covers a variety of areas catering for employees with difference job scopes 

and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are developed guided by well 

established industry and international standards such as ISO-9100, ISO-14000, ISO-45001 and bizSAFE. 

In addition, specific training curriculums are developed based on the specific requirements of the 

specific businesses and functions. We have a system for the employees to provide feedback after their 

training and for their head of department to evaluate the outcome of the training. 

5.2.3 

Workforce Diversity 

Our business thrives on diversity. As such, we leverage on a host of strengths and skills that can only 

come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, religion, age and 

gender.  

In FY2021, 102 of our employees were female, comprising 19.1% of our workforce, while 431 (80.9%) 

employees were male. In terms of management function, 8 females (15.7%) held managerial positions 

compared to 43 males (84.3%), while 94 females (19.5%) and 388 males (80.5%) held non-managerial 

positions. The larger percentage of males can be explained by the nature of the marine industry, which 

is predominately occupied by males. That being said, we still boost a healthy ratio amongst the gender 

for our group as a whole, and we will ensure that this relationship progresses into the future. From age 

profile perspective, there were 80 employees below 30 years old. The number of employees between 

30 and 50 years old was 354 as compared 99 employees above 50 years old. All members of our senior 

management team in Singapore, including general managers, directors and unit heads, are hired from 

the local community. 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 



Page 16 of 26 

 

 

 






 

 

 

 



Page 17 of 26 

 

In FY2021, we hired a total of 20 new employees, while 58 resigned during the same period. As a result, 

we have a net decrease of 38 in our workforce. Out of the new hires, 25.0% of the new hires were 

below the age of 30; 70.0% were between 30 and 50 years old while 5.0% were above 50 years old. 

The gender ratio of new hires was 12 males to 8 females. For the resignees, 22.4% were below the age 

of 30, 56.9% were between 30 and 50 years old while 20.7% were above 50 years old. The gender ratio 

of resignees was 50 males to 8 females.  

 

 

Since the crews working on vessels are hired on short term employment period, there would be high 

staff fluctuation and result in distorted staff turnover rate during the year.  Hence, we have excluded 

the crews in the statistics. In addition to the human resources we managed under our payroll internally, 

we also engage external contracted companies as our outsourced vendors which provide outsourced 

personnel, such as sub-contractors and security guards who might work within our premises. Although 

we supervise these people, they are employed by contracted companies and are not included in our 

head count. We do not employ other types of un-contracted workers. 

We expect that all the contracted companies we work with will share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In our vendor selection process, we take into consideration of their HR 

management practices as one of the key selection and performance criteria. We regularly review the 

performance of our vendors based on these criteria as a key basis to determine whether to continue 

to engage the vendors with their services.

5.2.4 

Employee Benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides basic 

employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, hours of 

work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide beyond-compliance-

level benefits to our fulltime employees. Examples of these benefits include paternity leave and 

compassionate leave.  

5.2.4.1 

Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to excel 

are the key drivers for our Company, we also recognize that well-being and contentment of our 

employees are pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and performance. Our 

employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their overall well-beings need to be 

well looked after in order for them to sustain their performance and realize their full potential.  

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we aim to create an environment that allows 

our employees to achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We achieve this through the 

adoption of a flexible approach to work arrangements. 

5.2.4.2 

Retirement and Healthcare  

Our Company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and 

regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with such 

laws and regulations.  

In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) personal savings scheme, which helps 

employees fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and education. Under this scheme, 

monthly deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their CPF savings accounts. We make 

employer contributions to these accounts, according to rates stipulated in the CPF Act. In addition to 

CPF contributions, we provide comprehensive medical coverage for all employees. For more 

information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates, please go to www.cpf.gov.sg.  

In Indonesia, in accordance to Law No 24 Year 2011, we provide pension funds facilities through 

government program in cooperation with Employee Social Security System - BADAN PENYELENGGARA 

JAMINAN SOSIAL (“BPJS”). The system helps employees fund their retirement (through BPJS 

Ketenagakerjaan) and healthcare (through BPJS Kesehatan). Under these facilities, monthly 

deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their respective BPJS accounts and we make 

employer contributions to these accounts, in accordance to President Decree No 45 year 2015 Art 28(3) 

for Pension, and President Decree no 12 year 2013 Art 16C(2) for Healthcare.

5.2.5 

Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) and take every precautionary step to 

prevent occupational injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions not only 

make our employees safer, but also boost morale. As an essential requirement, we are in compliance 

with the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act. In addition, we have attained 

certification for OHSAS-18001 and bizSAFE. These well recognized standards provide us with the 

framework to manage risks associated with safety and health in our workplace.

The fatality case recorded in FY2021 concerned a subcontractor worker who fell to the dock bottom 

from the main deck of a vessel in our Batam shipyard. The worker unknowingly removed the fastening 

of a power supply cable that was connected from shore to an electric panel on the main deck that 

provided subsequent power distribution for works on the vessel. Once the fastening was removed, the 

cable dropped from height and dragged the panel which subsequently hit the worker causing him to 

fall from height. Even though the vessel had railings, it could not prevent the worker’s fall due to the 

unexpected force of the impact. Our HSE department conducted an immediate investigation of the 

incident and concluded with corrective and preventive actions to be executed with immediate effect. 

The key corrective and preventive actions taken were for the Subcontractor’s company to ensure 

during such activities at height, qualified supervisor/foreman and safety personnel are in attendance 

to supervise the work.  In addition the Shipyard will ensure proper safety signage shall be in place to 

prevent unnecessary removal of fastenings. Furthermore, the HSE department conducted a refresher 

for safe work procedures and in-house HSE training for key shipyard personnel and subcontractor’s 

personnel.   

 

All incidents and accidents were investigated to identify areas of risk and improve mitigating and 

preventive controls.  We target to further strengthen our safety procedures to achieve zero 

occupational health and safety incident.    

 

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our Company has taken the following steps as part of our 

business continuity plan: 

1. 

We are regularly sharing updates and guidance with all employees, including those informed by 

expert advice and authorities such as travel restriction regionally, health and general advisories 

from Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (“MPA”); 

 

2. 

We have implemented safe management measures, according to the guidelines issued by MOM 

and Ministry of Health (“MOH”) respectively , including ensure safe distancing at workplace and 

facemasks donned at all times if physical interactions are unavoidable; staggered working hours/ 

rest days and work from home arrangement of employees, regular disinfection cleaning at 

common areas; temperature taking for all personnel entering the office and work areas; request 

for health/travel declaration and personal details for contact tracing; to conduct internal and 

external meetings virtually as much as possible; and discourage overseas travelling. 

 

3. 

We have taken extra precautionary measures such as discussions with clients at canteen area 

(open space) instead of confined meetings rooms and adopted discussions via telecommunication 

if possible.   We set up washing facilities at the guardhouse to ensure clients/customers duly wash 

their hands before entering the office;  

 

4. 

We keep abreast of the guidelines issued by MOH on Leave of Absence (LOA), Stay-Home Notice 

(SHN), Health Risk Warning (HRW), etc and implement these instructions to our workers/staff and 

stakeholders accordingly.  We have established a communication channel to ensure updated 

 

1 Reportable accidents are defined under Workplace Safety and Health (Incident Reporting) Regulations and 

Work Injury Compensation Regulations.  The numbers include employees, workers hired as sub-contractors 

and crews. 


 

 

 

 



Page 20 of 26 

 

news from the ministries are cascaded down to all personnel.   COVID-19 preventive measures 

and other related posters are put up at strategic locations to ensure the information is reach out 

to the masses; 

 

5. 

With the support of our top management and kind understanding from those foreign staff/clients, 

we have managed to re-allocate their work stations to minimise contacts yet not compromising 

the work processes; and 

 

6. 

For all the yard and contractor workers staying at the dormitory, specific instructions and 

restriction movement order are given.  Those workers serving their medical leave are confined in 

the dormitory isolation room.    

 

The above safety measures are also implemented in our Batam shipyards.  In conclusion, our top 

management emphasises strongly on the need to ensure that every employee in our Company is 

well protected to ensure no disruption to business operations.    

 

We will continue to ensure the health and safety of all personnel working at the yard by ensuring 

all precautionary measures are abided by at all times. 

5.2.6 

Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations and deeply 

ingrained in our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, and 

workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the work environment and discrimination 

and harassment of any kind is not tolerated at our Company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership of trade 

unions and other professional bodies.  

In FY2021, none of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of 

forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human 

rights-related grievances have been reported. 

5.3 Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs 

5.3.1 

Our Approach 

Customer service, quality products and the highest level of product safety have always been our 

priorities, with customer satisfaction being the goal of all our corporate activities. Customer retention 

begins with trust, and we place the utmost importance on training our employees in customer service 

excellence as well as in continuously striving to improve the quality and safety of our products and 

services. 

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily activities with 

customer interaction. In addition to striving for excellence in product service and support, we attach 

enormous importance to data privacy. We have process and controls in place over confidential and 

sensitive data related to our customers such as contracts. 

Since 2004, we have been certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management systems. The 

certification has helped us increase the control of our internal processes and the quality of our services.  

5.3.2 

Customer Feedback and Satisfaction 

We listen to our customers and take their opinions very seriously. We consolidate customer feedback 

through a range of communication channels including our website, customer surveys, and our 


 

 

 

 



Page 21 of 26 

 

customer service personnel. Through our customer feedback system, we capture our customers’ 

comments for analysis and action. Customer compliments are also tracked so that we can monitor 

where we are getting things right and cascade positive feedback to our employees, to their superiors 

and to our CEO.  

5.3.3 

Service Quality and Safety 

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. Health and safety of our 

customers is always our priority. To ensure product safety to our customers, we have in place a set of 

key quality assurance processes and standards, such ISO 9001, OHSAS-18001, BizSAFE, to ensure 

compliance with regulations and international standards. Ultimately, we aim to totally eliminate 

product safety incidents so as to foster a ‘Safety First’ culture through employee training and quality 

control.  

We build and repair vessels under stringent requirements of the classification society who establishes 

and maintains technical standards for construction and safe operation of our marine vessels at seas. 

We have conducted joint inspections at all stages of the development, fabrication, assembly, 

commissioning and operations to make sure that the design, components and machinery are 

developed, integrated and maintained in accordance with the standards. We have also successfully 

achieved compliance under UNCLOS, SOLAS and IMO’s regulatory framework for various diverse 

vessels’ type of notations requisites and special provisions to fulfil global safety and environmental 

standards at seas. 

5.3.4 

Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers such as contracts, customer orders and service delivery orders. Our information security 

policies ensure our customers’ data are managed in accordance to the level of confidentiality assigned. 

We observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information protection.  For 

the collection and disposal of wastepaper, we work with our office cleaning personnel for handling and 

reselling of wastepaper to recovery companies for pragmatic reasons.  

5.4 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

As a part of our ambition to realize sustainability throughout our value chain, we extend the application 

of responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We recognise that we are only at 

the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice throughout our supply chain, 

and we commit in our pragmatic approach to continuous improvement. We aim to identify new 

opportunities for collaboration with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and continue to 

build shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.4.2 

Supplier Selection 

Our key suppliers are carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When selecting our key 

suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services, as well as 

competitiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into consideration of the overall sustainability 

policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision on supplier selection is based on the overall 

assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria. 

5.4.3 

Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key suppliers to 


 

 

 

 



Page 22 of 26 

 

communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process ensures alignment of our 

key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements and sustainability objectives 

through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our partnership with our key suppliers. 

5.5 Supporting Our Community 

5.5.1 

Our Approach 

We have been providing support to the communities. The key motivation driving all our community 

engagement initiatives is to create a better environment for future generation.   We engaged on 

community initiatives on an ad hoc basis.  We have not set a target for community contribution in view 

of the protracted downturn and uncertainty of recovery in the global marine industry.  We will monitor 

our community contribution every year after the Company starts to generate profit. 

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2); the underlying measures for direct and indirect CO2 

emissions calculation are electricity consumption in kilowatt Hours (kWh) and fuel consumed. The 

electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. To 

ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures over 

time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our 

revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in 

t-CO2 per SGD million of revenue and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD 

million of revenue.

year Electricity Consumption Index stands at 100,580, which is a 25.8% increase as compared to prior 

year.  Compared to our goal of a 10% improvement in both indexes by 2030, our FY2021 performance 

was off track as FY2021 is an abnormal year due to COVID-19 pandemic.  More electricity was 

consumed as a result of split of teams in different locations as well as having the computer turned on 

at all times to facilitate remote access to the Company’s network from home.  In addition, the addition 

of a floating drydock in Singapore yard has also resulted in increased electricity consumption.  We will 

continue to strive to sustain our performance towards our 2030 goals.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, 

such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is 

adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per million SGD.

year Paper Consumption Index stands at 31.26, which is a 11.8% increase as compared to prior year.  

However, the index is still below the target set for FY2021.  The lower paper consumption is partly due 

to work from home arrangement for office staff.
