Board Statement     

We are pleased to present our second Sustainability Report for FY2018 that shows our 

approach towards sustainability as well as our practices and performance around relevant 

material topics. 

 

Advanced Systems Automation Limited (“ASA”, and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) is the world’s first total backend inline equipment solution which is used by 

semiconductor assembly processes around the world. As we grow and expand our 

competency and skillset in the business, we commit ourselves to good sustainability practices 

to continue to remain successful. Strategic considerations and actions around sustainability 

increases resilience in our business. We remain committed to the health &amp; safety and welfare 

of our employees. We ensure that we are in adherence to global and industrial standards and 

guidelines while providing safe and positive working environment to our employees.  

 

We are supported by our Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”) to determine, manage 

and communicate sustainability risks and opportunities relevant to our business. We also 

remain responsible for the development and implementation of sustainability strategies and 

to incorporate sustainability into ASA’s policies and practices. We followed a comprehensive 

materiality assessment exercise last year and reviewed the identified material topics in 

FY2018 to determine high impact areas to support our business strategy. We concluded that 

our 9 ESG material topics in FY2018 remained unchanged from last year. 

 

 

We are committed in communicating and managing sustainability risks and opportunities to 

stakeholders. Ethical business practices and product excellence serve as basic principles for 

our reputation, profitability and long-term success.  

 

We look forward to share our sustainability experience in FY2018. 

 

How We Wrote the Report 

Our second sustainability report presents ASA’s sustainability practices and performances for 

the period of 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). ASA manufactures automated 

front-end and back-end equipment for semiconductor companies. Based in Singapore, the 

Group has 2 research and development centres and 8 factories. Our operations are located in 

Southeast Asia, Greater China, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. We 

selected the scope of this report to cover Microfits’ business operations in Singapore, as it is 

currently the most material area of our business. 

 

ASA publishes a sustainability report on an annual basis. This report is in compliance with the 

requirements of SGX-ST Catalist Rules 711A and 711B and references the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards (2016). This report references the following topic-specific

Sustainability Governance 

Our sustainability strategy is in its second year and is headed by our Sustainability Steering 

Committee (SSC). SSC provides strong direction coupled with an effective sustainability 

governance framework to identify, assess and manage the environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) issues that are important to us and our stakeholders. In consultation with 

our Board of Directors, the SSC oversees the development of the sustainability strategy, 

sustainability performance and monitoring, as well as the production of this sustainability 

report. 

 

Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) 

SSC is represented by senior members of the Administration, Finance, Human Resources and 

Information Technology divisions at ASA. SSC provides advice and assistance to the Board in 

ensuring that policies and procedures in relation to ESG issues are aligned with ASA’s 

business strategy. The SSC is supported by a Sustainability Task Force (“STF”) comprising of 

employees from Microfits Pte Ltd, which is responsible for driving sustainability initiatives and 

programmes across ASA. 

 

Monitoring and Benchmarking 

We monitor and evaluate our sustainability performance against our peer companies in order 

to improve our own performance and to identify areas of improvement. We conduct a review 

of our approach to sustainability from the identified gaps as compared to our peer groups so 

that we are in a better position to execute targeted actions to address the gaps.

Stakeholder Engagement 

We have identified key stakeholder groups that are instrumental to the Group’s success. 

Through regular meetings with stakeholders, we better understand the ESG issues that may 

be of most concern to them and align the needs of these stakeholders in our business 

decisions.  

 

Each stakeholder contributes to our success and it is important for us to identify and assess 

how we can better address the key issues and provide the needs of our stakeholders. Our 

approach to stakeholder engagement, which includes information on our key stakeholders 

and ways we engage with them is presented as follows:

Materiality Assessment 

 

In order for us to accurately assess the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors that 

are material for the continuity of the Company’s business, we have engaged our various 

stakeholders and evaluated their importance to our business operations. The assessment 

involved members of the senior management team from ASA and took into account research 

conducted on global and local trends in our industry, material topics identified by our peers 

and industry best practices. In FY2018, we reviewed the materiality assessment process and 

concluded that the 10 material topics identified in the previous year are still reflective of our 

business direction and continue to remain relevant this year.  

 

This year, we have mapped our material ESG factors to the UN Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were developed as guide for stakeholders around the world to align 

their efforts to achieve progress in some of the most pressing global sustainability related 

issues. By mapping our ESG factors to these we are hoping to demonstrate our contribution 

to this progress. 

 

We are committed to managing, measuring and reporting on issues that are material to us 

and our stakeholders. The issues that are material to the Group in FY2018, which have been 

prioritised and validated by the Board of Directors, are presented as follows:

Economic 

Economic Performance 

 

We carry out our operations in a responsible manner, so as to create value for all our 

stakeholders, particularly our shareholders. In order to deliver value to all our stakeholders, 

our focus is to maintain a strong financial position by building resilience throughout our 

business operations for long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. 

 

Our financial performance for FY2018 can be found in the Financial Highlights section (page 

9) and Appendix 2 - Audited Financial Statements (pages 8 to 64) of the Annual Report 2018 

to be released and our Full Year Financial Results announcement which was released on 31 

March 2019. 

 

Our Environment 

Energy and Emissions  

 

 

 

Our large portion of operations costs is attributed to electricity usage in the manufacturing 

process which results in indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With implementation of 

carbon tax in Singapore from 2019, where tax will be levied on direct emitters mainly power 

plants, it will result in an increase in energy costs. In such changing scenario and increasing 

climate risks, we are committed to reducing energy consumption and indirect GHG emissions 

as we improve our efficiencies and reduce costs.  

 

ASA recognises our responsibility to reduce environmental impacts of our business 

operations. As our environmental impacts are mainly from our energy consumption which 

results in indirect GHG emissions, we commit to minimise our environmental footprint 

through sustainable practices and initiatives. We plan to further improve our electricity-

saving efforts through continuous education of employees to increase awareness of the 

importance of environmental sustainability.

At ASA, we conduct regular monitoring of our energy consumption in equipment 

manufacturing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning by implementing a robust monitoring 

system. With implementation of energy monitoring initiatives our operational costs have 

been reduced.  

 

We consumed 212,209 KWh of electricity for our operations in FY2018, representing a 

decrease of 12.3%, which was mainly due to a reduction in office space. Our electricity 

intensity increased by 121% from 62 kWh/m2 in FY2017 to 137 kWh/m2 in FY2018. Therefore, 

we did not achieve the target set for FY2018 to maintain our energy intensity within 3-5% of 

FY2017’s levels. Although we had reduced the overall usage of electricity with the releasing 

of some office space, however in the remaining space which houses our operations, we have 

been carrying out extensive testing of a new machine under Equipment business segment. 

This new machine with a new design will improve our operations moving forward. 

 

As our major source of energy consumption is attributed to electricity which has resulted in 

89 tCO2e of indirect emissions. While there was a decrease of electricity consumption in our 

operations, our GHG emissions intensity increased, in line with the electricity intensity, from 

0.03 tCO2e/m2 in FY2017 to 0.06 tCO2e/m2 in FY2018.

Waste 

 

In the manufacturing industry, the challenge of waste reduction is to identify and take action 

on all waste areas. At ASA, we consider waste management a key issue mainly because our 

stakeholders and the communities have a great interest on how we manage waste generated 

from our business operations. Improper waste disposal can cause pollution, posing a threat 

to the environment and to human health.  

 

We comply with all environmental regulations, and we go beyond legal statues to manage 

hazardous and non-hazardous waste. We have also put in place an ISO14001-certified 

environmental management system for all our operations. We conduct regular, systematic 

waste reduction audits to identify all potential areas of waste reduction. We have measures 

in place to monitor the life cycle of raw materials. We ensure that our generated waste is 

processed through incineration, landfill or other disposal methods that adhere to local rules 

and regulations, such as the Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations 

1988 in Singapore. In FY2018, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with laws and 

regulations concerning waste management/disposal reported. We met our target set for 

FY2018 to achieve zero incidents of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations. 

 

A total of 296 tonnes of non-hazardous waste generated was incinerated at an off-site waste 

management facility during FY2018. This is a little higher than last year’s 168 tonnes due to 

changes in business activities. 

 

At ASA, we have prohibition on burning of waste within our premises. All general waste and 

toxic industrial waste are segregated and disposed of accordingly. We strive to recycle and 

possibly reuse most of the general waste generated. We ensure collection and storage of all 

waste oils in secured and labelled drums at designated areas to prevent any leaks or spills. All 

our waste oils and solid waste are sent to licensed third party contractors for safe disposal.

Our People 

Talent Attraction and Retention  

 

At ASA, we value and respect each individual in the organisation and ensure that all of our 

employees feel they are a part of the organisation. We are committed to provide equal and 

fair employment opportunities as we believe in employing diverse talent which is required for 

growth and innovation in our business.  

 

As at 31 December 2018, we have 32 

employees2 based in Singapore, and 41% of 

them were within the 30-to-50-year age group. 

Male and female employees accounted for 78% 

and 22% of ASA’s workforce respectively. In 

FY2018, our average monthly turnover rate was 

0.3%. We met our target set for FY2018 - to 

achieve an employee turnover rate less than or 

equal to the industry average. There was no 

turnover of employees at Microfits in FY2018. 

 

We have a robust system to collect, track and 

monitor our human resources (HR) data 

including overtime, vacation balances and the 

number of training days.  

 

We believe in a transparent talent acquisition 

system. We offer our employees a competitive 

compensation and a range of other benefits, 

such as health care coverage, parental leave 

and retirement plans. We do not discriminate 

during our recruitment process and ensure to 

adopt fair practices for all the deserving 

candidates, including persons with disabilities, 

by offering remuneration as per market 

standards.   

 

We ensure that we recruit and retain the best 

talent. We also learn from the employees who leave the company through the exit interviews 

where we gather feedback and comments. It gives us some key insights on the areas for 

improvement in our recruitment and talent retention system.

Training and Education 

 

At ASA, we grow with the right pool of talent who work together for the success of the 

organisation. Our HR department assesses the current and future skills requirements for our 

business operations and design learning and development programmes to meet these 

requirements. We tailor these programmes to meet the needs of employees and to enhance 

their personal and professional development. Each employee is required to complete all 

mandatory training courses throughout the year.  

 

There are special training programmes for the Senior Management to identify and groom 

promising individuals as part of our succession planning.  

 

 

In FY2018, our employees were provided with 

trainings with an average of 0.4 hour per 

employee. Approximately 25% of total training 

hours 

were 

recorded 

by 

the 

senior 

management team, 17% and 58% were 

recorded by the middle management team and 

executives, respectively. 

 

 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

We take pride in our commitment to maintain high level of health and safety standards. We 

have a workplace health and safety committee to promote health and safety initiatives and 

programmes.  The committee comprises of the management and employee representatives 

who work together to improve health, safety and working conditions in the workplace, 

develop and implement corrective and preventive action plan. We also provide daily 

reminders on best safety practices and put banners in the office and workplace.  

 

We adopt safe work practices, such as implementing standard operating procedures and 

carrying out emergency response training to ensure that the risk of accidents, injuries and 

exposure to health hazards for all of our employees and contractors is minimised. Our safety 

handbook outlines standard safety practices and requirements that our employees and 

contractors have to adhere to. Appropriate health and safety training is provided to our 

employees to ensure that they are able to identify and deal with common hazards in the 

workplace.

We conduct site inspections to ensure that all our equipment in our premises do not pose 

any risks to the employees’ health and safety. We have set measures in place for air, water 

and noise pollution reduction in and around our manufacturing plants. 

 

We regularly conduct maintenance and inspections of the compressors. In order to reduce 

noise pollution, compressed air guns in our manufacturing plants are used in short intervals. 

We also place signs in areas where hearing protection is mandatory so that employees are 

not exposed to excessive noise. 

 

We seek to identify any potential hazards and to monitor the effectiveness of local risk 

control measures implemented. We provide signage on emergency plans and procedures in 

our premises which are easily identifiable by our employees and occupants in each building. 

Fire drills are conducted twice a year by the property owner in order to ensure that our 

employees are familiar with emergency procedures during a fire. During our fire drills, all 

employees and contractors are trained to identify and operate fire extinguishers placed in 

various locations within our premises. Regular inspections on fire extinguishers are 

conducted and signed off. 

 

There were zero reported workplace fatalities in FY2018, and we have achieved our target 

set for zero workplace fatalities. However there were 2 injuries in the workplace caused by a 

wooden beam and a plastic mallet in FY2018. Corrective action has been taken to prevent 

occurrence of similar incident.

removed from the list of raw material suppliers. No new suppliers and vendors were engaged 

in FY2018.  

 

We require our suppliers to comply with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 

Directive, which includes a CE-marking directive3.

guidance. Failure to follow the labelling guidance can result in negative consequences such as 

product recalls and withdrawals.

equipment contain the right information and instructions for correct and safe operation. We 

adhere to Singapore Code of Advertising Practice for all our equipment and machineries. We
