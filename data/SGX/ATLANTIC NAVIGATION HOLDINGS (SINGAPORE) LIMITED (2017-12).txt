1.B. Strategy 

 

1.B.i. Strategy - General &amp; Outlook 

 

With the increase in the oil price and the Middle Eastern National Oil Company’s 

(“MENOC”) commitment to increase production levels, activity in the Middle East 

exploration and production sectors (our primary markets) is increasing and new field 

development programs which were on hold are starting up again. We expect charter rates 

in our region to remain competitive but we expect our fleet utilization to improve due to 

the deployment of 7 new vessels to support contracts secured by the Group and a greater 

demand across the region in line with the increase in activity and stated growth and 

production strategies of the MENOCs.  

 

We expect continuing competitive pressure on charter rates due to the influx of 

excess tonnages from other more adversely affected regions into the Middle East. We 

continue to align ourselves to this situation and have been focusing on maintaining and 

protecting the high level of utilization of our existing fleet and securing employment for 

its vessels at competitive market rates. The focus on cost control will continue without 

sacrificing operational efficiency or service level. We continue to explore and receive new 

businesses opportunities with existing and new clients. We also continue to evaluate its 

capital structure to ensure that we will be able to undertake these new businesses and meet 

all our obligations. 

 

1.B.ii. Specific Goals, Plans &amp; Strategy Elements 

 

1) To ensure that the last 2 vessels of 7 new vessels for a MENOC’s 10 vessels project is 

delivered to the MENOC, and the chartering will start by end of December 2018. Atlantic 

Group had previously taken the delivery of the 2 vessels in October 2018, and the vessels 

had just arrived at our home port for inspection and crew training. Atlantic Group had taken 

the delivery of 5 of the new vessels in April 2018, and the vessels started on their contracts 

in June 2018. 

 

2)  Having recently completed a US$45 million deconstruction project, the first of its kind 

in the Middle East, with our joint venture partner, the goal now is to continue to work with 

strategic partners on such project to diversify our business and reduce reliance on our core 

MLS Division. 

 

3) To build up our organization in Saudi Arabia, both administratively and operationally, 

so as to compete more effectively for new contracts, while focusing on one of our largest 

clients: Saudi Aramco.  

 

4) As the MLS Division is a capital-intensive industry, Atlantic Group had paid off 

US$17.3 million in principal and interest on a convertible loan carrying 15% interest to: 

 

a) reduce our leverage and interest cost; and 

b) improve our margin and profitability. 


 

14 

 



 

5) To support new projects secured in the near future only with our own vessels or 

chartered-in vessels. We also plan not to invest in new assets until charter rates are at a 

more acceptable level, and there is higher certainty in the oil &amp; marine industries. 

 

6) To invest in system, processes and training for higher efficiency and cost effectiveness, 

especially in our administrative and operational departments. 

 

7) To aggressively review and lower operational expenditures, without sacrificing 

operation and service quality.

1.C. Board Statement 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-14: Statement from senior decision-maker 

▪ 

GRI: 102-32: Highest governance body’s role in sustainability reporting 

 

Board Statement 

 

“The board of directors (the “Board” or the “Directors”) of the Company is of the 

view that the sustainability report provides a reasonable and transparent presentation of the 

Company’s sustainability performance, specifically shedding light on its environmental, 

social, and governance (“ESG”) impacts. In this respect, we affirm that our sustainability 

reporting is in compliance with the first year reporting requirements under the Catalist 

Rules. 

 

This statement also conforms with Singapore Code of Corporate Governance 

(issued on May 2, 2012) (the “CG Code”), and specifically Principle 1 of the CG Code, 

which states that the Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 

Company. Furthermore, in line with Guideline 1.1 of the CG Code, we affirm that that the 

Board has fulfilled its role in considering and determining the material sustainability issues 

throughout this report, and has considered and will continue to consider and further assess 

ESG factors on an ongoing basis of the Atlantic Group’s strategic formulation and 

direction. 

 

The Board’s close interaction with management has enabled us to satisfy ourselves 

on the way sustainability governance is structured and functioning through the various 

levels of management (for example, in setting the company’s values and standards) and we 

plan to collaborate even closer with management in order to endeavor together towards our 

holistic sustainability goals. In this regard, we currently provide oversight over 

management through the lens of sustainability performance, and continuously strive to 

improve in this respect by reviewing on a quarterly basis the Group’s material ESG factors 

 

Concerning future reporting, the Board is in correspondence with the management 

and other stakeholders in order to determine what needs to be done to improve 

sustainability reporting for the next periods. For the upcoming sustainability report, we 

stress the need for full compliance with second year reporting requirements under the 

Catalist Rules, adoption of Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) reporting framework to 

meet at least the core requirements, improved materiality and stakeholder engagement 

methodologies, among others. 

 

Overall, the Board has ultimate responsibility for the Atlantic Group’s 

sustainability practices. Should any questions arise concerning the report, the Board would 

be certainly addressed.”

▪ 

GRI: 102-11: Precautionary principle or approach 

▪ 

GRI: 102-16: Values, principles, standards, and norms of behavior 

 

We recognise that our industry is sensitive in the area of ethics and corruption. Any 

such issues can lead to significant reputational damage, legal consequences and loss of 

customers to our business.  

 

We have no tolerance for bribery and corruption in our business. We aim to achieve 

the highest levels of corporate ethics and transparency through sound corporate governance 

and appropriate internal controls. 

 

In addition, we have put in place a whistle-blowing policy whereby employees may, 

in confidence, report possible improprieties which may cause financial or non-financial 

loss of the Company, including but not limited to fraud, misappropriation of assets, sexual 

harassment, criminal breach of trust, corruption, questionable or improper accounting, 

misuse of confidential information, breach of Atlantic Group’s policies and authorities, and 

acts or omissions which are deemed to be against the interest of the Atlantic Group, laws, 

regulations or public policies. Whistle blowers could call and/or email to the Whistle 

Blowing Committee directly and in confidence, and his/her identity is protected from 

reprisals within the limit of the law.  

 

Our employees are briefed and have received communication on our whistle-

blowing policy. There have been no cases of whistle-blowing in the Group during the 

reporting period. Our Group will continue to keep the whistle-blowing policy and other 

internal controls in place to prevent wrongful acts.

1.F. Reporting Practice 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-48: Restatements of information 

▪ 

GRI: 102-49: Changes in reporting  

▪ 

GRI: 102-51: Date of most recent report  

 

Since this is Atlantic Group’s first sustainability report (complying with first year 

requirements), there is no date for previous reports, no previous report to compare changes 

from, and no previous report to restate information from. However, in the subsequent 

sustainability reports, these changes, dates, and restatements would be clearly highlighted. 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-50: Reporting period  

 

Our financial year-end is 31 December (“FY”). Therefore, our reporting period 

would be from 1 January to 31 December. For the purpose of this first year report, the 

reporting period is 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-52: Reporting cycle  

 

Pursuant to Catalist Rule 711A, an issuer must issue a sustainability report for its 

financial year, no later than 5 months after the end of the financial year. Our reporting 

cycle, then, is maximum on the 31st May each year to report on the previous financial year’s 

sustainability activities. This is to note, however, that for the first year of sustainability 

reporting, a longer period of up to 12 months is provided.

▪ 

GRI: 102-56: External assurance  

 

External Assurance of Sustainability Report: 

As this is the first time that Atlantic Group prepares a sustainability report, there 

still has not been an opportunity to conduct external sustainability assurance over our 

sustainability report. However, this is something that we will plan for in the future. 

 

External Assurance of Financial Reports: 

External assurance over our financial reports are provided by our external auditors: 

Ernst &amp; Young LLP. The opinion of our auditors over our financial statements for the 

FY2017 remain unqualified.

Part 2: Stakeholder Engagement, Materiality &amp; Material Topics Alignment 

 

2.A. Stakeholder Engagement 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-46: Defining report content and topic boundaries  

 

In order to report on the material ESG topics for Atlantic Group, it is important to 

first determine the important stakeholders that will form the basis of these topics. This is 

done through a stakeholder-centered approach that follows the following process: 

 

 

Stakeholder-Centered Approach to Materiality 

 

 

 

 

1

• List potential stakeholders, classified as external or internal.

2

• Impact matrix to identify high, medium, and low impact stakeholders.

3

• List engagement methods for each stakeholder, based on impact 

importance.

4

• Engage with the relevant stakeholders to conduct impact rating on a list of 

potentially material ESG factors.

5

• Create a materiality matrix that identifies each material topic according to 

the stakeholder impact rating results and other best-practice benchmarking 

results.

6

• Align the material topics to sustainability frameworks (in this case, GRI &amp; 

UNSDGs) to highlight their ESG elements.

7

• Report on each material ESG factor identified, focusing on the high-

intensity topics on the materiality matrix.


 

21 

 



• Step 1: 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-40: List of stakeholder groups  

 

Atlantic Group interacts with and impacts (directly and indirectly) a variety of 

stakeholder groups. An assessment resulted in the list of 9 potentially relevant 

stakeholders below, classified as to whether they are internal or external to the 

organization: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-41: Collective bargaining agreements 

 

Atlantic Group does not have any collective bargaining agreements with employees 

or other stakeholders.

• Step 2: 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-42: Identifying and selecting stakeholders  

 

After listing the 3 internal and 6 external stakeholder groups that could be 

potentially relevant, another assessment was done to determine the stakeholders’ 

relevance based on the impact they have on us, as well as the impact we have on them. 

A further steps adds a column on the right the helps determine the type of engagement 

with each stakeholder group based on the impact intensity (to be discussed in Step 3). 

The results are illustrated in the below Stakeholder Impact Matrix:

The results of the stakeholder impact matrix show that stakeholders with highest-

intensity impact on and from Atlantic Group are 1 external stakeholder group (customers) 

and 2 internal stakeholder groups (employees and management). 

 

1) Customers 

 

Customers have a high impact from us since they benefit from our services and 

pay for them. We also have a high impact from them since our operations are ultimately 

aimed to enhance our quality to them, and the financial returns from them keep us going. 

 

2, 3) Employees &amp; Management 

 

In terms of employees and management, they are the building blocks of Atlantic 

Group, interacting with the organization on a nearly daily basis for myriad hours each day. 

The organization provides the employees and management with ample compensation, and 

their performance and behavior reflect on the success and image of the organization as a 

whole. Furthermore, management makes decisions that could significantly alter all of 

Atlantic Group’s operations. 

 

8) Government / Regulators 

 

As for government / regulators, it is shown that they have a high impact on us, 

since regulations can significantly affect our operations and decision-making, and we 

should make sure to comply with any reports and procedures required. However, we do 

not have as much of a high impact on this stakeholder group since the government / 

regulators is dealing with various other companies across Singapore and outside.

7) Community 

 

The community has been identified as having a medium impact on us, while we 

may a low impact on it. The community affects us as we form a certain reputation and 

brand image from their perspective. This can often be so significant that it may even affect 

our stock price, which in itself is built largely on consumer confidence. While these 

elements show how community may impact us, we do not believe we have too much of 

an impact on the rest of the community (outside of our immediate stakeholders), especially 

as the community has several other organizations to deal with. 

 

5) Creditors 

 

Similar to the community, creditors have also been identified as having a low 

impact from us, but a medium impact on us. The loans we receive from creditors have a 

significant impact on our financial position and, by extension, our decision-making 

ranging from operational to strategic elements. The amount of credit we have access to 

and the interest rates provided affects our weighted average cost of capital (WACC), so 

certain debt and equity must be made to ensure an optimal financial position. On the other 

hand, in terms of our impact on creditors, this is determined as relatively low since 

creditors will likely be dealing with several other borrowers as well. Even financially, 

besides the principal amount paid at maturity (or before), the creditors are only paid with 

interest periodically. Besides these issues outlined, our creditors do not have much 

interaction or involvement with us. 

 

4, 6, 9) Others 

 

 

The other stakeholders include shareholders, suppliers, and competitors—which 

have shown to have a medium impact on us, and a medium impact on them. As for 

shareholders, the impact comes from their funding and shareholder meetings, though they 

do not often deal with any operational day-to-day issues. As for suppliers, we impact each 

other through the partnership we have to procure our needs; similarly, suppliers are not 

dealt with on a routine and direct basis, and we would likely not drastically impact each 

other. As for competitors, there is some impact as they should be considered throughout 

our decision making, especially as we operationally strive for optimal price and costing, 

and strategically strive for competitive advantage. However, both competitors and 

Atlantic Group have many other stakeholders that could have a more intense impact.

• Step 3: 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-43: Approach to stakeholder engagement 

 

 

After identifying the relevant stakeholders, Atlantic Group determines how these 

stakeholders are engaged. Using the same stakeholder impact matrix in Step 2, the type 

of engagement can be determined according the to the intensity of impact, where the 

types of engagement (from highest impact to lowest impact stakeholders) are: 

empower, collaborate, involve, consult, and inform. 

 

The results of the stakeholder impact matrix (along with engagement types) show 

that customers, employees, and management should be engaged in an empowering 

way, since they are very highly significant. This means that our actions should not be 

aimed at simply communicating with these stakeholders, but also empowering them to 

be able to reap the optimal benefits for both us and them. Customers could be 

empowered through events and superb quality of service, while employees and 

management could be empowered through training, events, certain policies &amp; 

procedures, etc. 

 

Next in significant are government / regulators, who should be engaged with in a 

collaborative way. This means that they are not too significant to directly allocate our 

resources to in order to empower, yet they are significant enough to collaborate with 

rather than just simply communicate with. This can be done by having Atlantic Group 

representatives meeting with government representatives / regulators in a productive 

and meaningful way, especially to hear the concerns of both parties and work together 

towards maximizing the benefits of each. 

 

The rest of the stakeholders should be involved with Atlantic Group—i.e. not only 

communicated with in an informative or consultative manner, but rather directly 

engaged with. 

 

Next, after determining the engagement category for the appropriate stakeholders, 

the next table lists the specific engagement methods Atlantic Group applies towards 

each of these stakeholder groups:

2.B. Identification of Material Topics 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-44: Key topics and concerns raised 

 

After determining the most significant stakeholders and their engagement methods, 

the next step is to use the input from these stakeholders, to determine ESG topics that are 

most material to them. Important stakeholders, especially employees and management, 

were engaged by doing an impact rating of a list of potentially material ESG topics. 7 

potentially material topics were extracted, and stakeholders were to rate the importance of 

these topics based on various dimensions of impact. Impact rating was done on a scale of 

0 to 3, meaning: 

 

• 0: No impact 

• 1: Low impact 

• 2: Medium impact 

• 3: High impact 

 

The table below shows how stakeholders rate the 7 preliminary topics across various 

dimensions:

2.C. Materiality Matrix 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-47: List of material topics 

 

After having identified the most material ESG topics to stakeholders derived from 

internal stakeholders, the next step is to create a materiality matrix. This matrix has the 

internal stakeholders’ ratings on the x-axis, and the y-axis maps these material topics with 

external sources to determine their importance. Specifically, these external sources include 

benchmarking / best practice of how these material topics (or similar topics) were rated in 

other materiality matrices in various other sustainability reports.

• Step 6: 

 

2.D. Sustainability Reporting Frameworks 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-54: Claims of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards 

 

After identifying the material topics with their materiality levels, the next 

step is to map each topic with its associated sustainability frameworks, in order to 

highlight on each one’s ESG elements. In this case, the topics are mapped to GRI 

indicators, as well as to UNSDGs. 

 

Additionally, this is to also note that besides material topic alignment to 

GRI, GRI is also the foundational basis upon which this report is prepared and even 

structured. Specifically, Parts 1 &amp; 2 are structured on GRI General Disclosures, 

while Parts 3, 4, and 5 are structured on Topic-Specific GRI’s. 

 

Furthermore, though it is not required by the Catalist Rules, this report is 

aligned with the “Core” GRI requirements, meaning the core GRI indicators have 

been addressed. In terms of future sustainability reports, we aim to at least provide 

core GRI level and preferably “Comprehensive” level in the near future.

3.A. Material Topic #1: Environment 

 

3.A.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Global &amp; Industrial Standards 

 

As one of the leading offshore companies operating mainly in the Middle East, 

Atlantic Group is fully committed to implementing and complying with all of the standards 

and codes from: 

 

• International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) conventions 

• International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) 

• Internal Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 

(“MARPOL”), including all 6 annexes 

• Other conventions directly or indirectly related to safety and the 

environment in full as a minimum measure  

 

Client Standards 

 

All of our key clients and their EPC subcontractors require not only to comply fully 

with all the international regulations related to ESG (especially environmental) 

compliance, but also to meet and comply with their own specific standards and 

requirements. Most of these specific standards and requirements deal with their health, 

safety, and environmental (“HSE”) policies.  

 

Our Compliance 

 

Atlantic Group’s fleet of vessels comply fully with these regulations, standards and 

specific requirements from our clients and global/industrial standards. 

 

▪ 

GRI: 102-13: Membership of associations 

 

Atlantic Group has various HSE-related accreditations, including: 

 

• International Safety Management (ISM) DOC 

• International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 

• Quality Management System (QMS) 

• Environmental Management System (EMS) 

• Occupational Health &amp; Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001:2008 

 

 

 

 

 


 

35 

 



3.A.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

Proactive Compliance 

 

For us, compliance with various HSE standards is critical for us to continue to serve 

our existing contracts and to secure and tender for new contracts from clients—whether 

existing and new. In order to ensure this into the future, we strive to not only meet the 

current standards, but to also proactively anticipate and prepare our fleet for any future 

possible HSE standards that may arise—whether from clients or from global/industrial 

initiatives. Of course, in order to achieve this proactive compliance, we must constantly be 

aware of HSE impacts, and must continuously plan for and implement new measures for 

improving HSE elements within our operations, in our fleet of vessels, etc. 

 

HSE Accreditations 

 

Additionally, Atlantic Group plans to widen its portfolio of HSE-related 

certifications, and is currently preparing to achieve at the least the following in the near 

future: 

 

• ISO 22000:2018 Safe Food Management, including hazard analysis and critical 

control points (HACCP) 

• Energy Management ISO 50001:2018 

 

Various Possible Solutions for Lower Sulphur Content 

 

In maritime transport, Heavy Fuel Oil (“HFO”) is unfortunately still the most used 

fuel for ship engines. The required content of 0.10% Sulphur in the fuel, however, cannot 

be achieved with HFO. Therefore, many shipping companies and charterers are now using 

Marine Gas Oil (“MGO”) instead, which is low in Sulphur content, allowing easier 

compliance to the required low levels of Sulphur. 

 

We are currently in-progress in terms of adopting MGO instead of HFO in our 

vessels, in order to comply with the low Sulphur content levels. We plan to continue this 

until all of our vessels are using MGO with low Sulphur content. 

 

Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”) for New Ships 

 

Ship exhaust gases can not only be reduced by the use of higher quality fuels or 

exhaust gas cleaning systems, but also by increasing the energy efficiency of a ship. For 

this reason, the IMO has adopted an amendment to MARPOL annex VI to increase the 

energy efficiency of new ships. According to this amendment, all new ships must now have 

a so called EEDI. The EEDI is an index for new ships indicating the CO2 emissions per 

ton of cargo and nautical mile sailed. The energy efficiency of tankers, bulk carriers and 

container ships can be calculated depending on the ship’s size by a formula. There are also 

formulas for other types of ships such as ferries, passenger ships or special types of ships 

(e.g. tugs and supply vessels). 


 

36 

 



 

Our plans, then, are to at least ensure that EEDI is applied to at least our new ships, 

aiming at eventually applying it to our whole fleet of vessels (and this is currently in 

progress). Furthermore, we aim to comply with at least the minimum efficiency levels 

required by EEDI, reducing our average CO2 emissions per ton of cargo, and reduce our 

average CO2 emissions per nautical mile sailed.

4.A. Material Topic #2: Succession Planning 

 

4.A.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Atlantic Group has recently gone through various changes related to its employees, 

management, and Board members—meaning that succession planning arises as an 

important topic for the Atlantic Group. Atlantic Group recognizes that succession planning 

for the Board and key management positions can be a long-drawn process, with the 

successors having to spend time managing different aspects / departments of the Atlantic 

Group's business in order to ensure proper, smooth knowledge and skill transfer. 

 

Succession planning, in particular for the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wong Siew 

Cheong (“Bill”), has been identified as a key risk, due to the following strengths that the 

successor would be expected to match: 

 

i) Bill is the founder and key shareholder of the operating entity in the UAE (Atlantic 

Maritime Group FZE) since its formation some 17 years ago. 

 

ii) As such, Bill is a known figure in the industry, not just in the Middle East (where we 

operate), but also in Singapore and Asia. Specifically, he is especially well-known in 

Southeast Asia, where we have our business partners and associates, and also in China, 

where we source and buy most of our new vessels. 

 

iii) Through his period in charge, Bill had established a strong relationship in the Middle 

East with our clients and key suppliers, and this often leads to joint collaboration on works 

and projects. 

 

iv) Bill had devoted much of his time on the strategic direction of Atlantic Group, and has 

nurtured the growth of the fleet from 12 vessels since its listing on Catalist in August 2012, 

to 21 vessels today. 

 

 

Because of the above, Bill’s resignation may leave a gap in Atlantic Group’s 

operations and opportunities, which, if not filled appropriately, may lead to various risks 

and lost opportunities. 

 

As a result, the Atlantic Group is striving to proactively address this issue as soon 

as possible, and had recently recruited a new Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) with 

experience in all areas of the Group's business. 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

39 

 



4.A.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

 

Concerning the general issue of succession planning, Atlantic Group plans to 

methodically follow specific procedures that ensure proper hand-over and knowledge / skill 

transfer once employees or managers leave. Furthermore, there is currently a management 

plan to continuously update and provide the Board with assessment on an annual basis as 

to the status and progress on its succession plans for key management positions. 

 

 

Concerning specifically Bill’s issue, the new COO is the beginning of the solution. 

Atlantic Group is currently nurturing the COO to lead the Atlantic Group, so as to, over 

time, he may gain enough holistic skills and experience to be able to lead the entire Atlantic 

Group. Similarly, the plan is to keep the Board up-to-date as to the COO’s progress.

4.B. Material Topic #6: Localization 

 

4.B.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Importance of Localization 

 

 

Atlantic Group must comply with the minimum local staffing requirements set by 

the governments we operate in and the clients we deal with. Specifically, we must ensure 

that are hiring ample numbers of Saudi and Emirati nationals, since our main operations 

are in the UAE and the KSA. 

 

For us, localization is more of an opportunity than compliance requirements. It is a 

chance for us learn about the local environment in which we operate, and also a chance to 

bolster our local image and standing. Furthermore, since we are already established and 

complying to the localization requirements, this is currently an opportunity for us that may 

keep out potential market entrants in the region; in effect, the localization requirements act 

as a form of cabotage / barrier to entry that makes it more difficult for other foreign 

companies to comply, and, as a result, to secure business in the Middle East and North 

Africa (MENA) region. 

 

On the other hand, while there is opportunity, there is also risk of non-compliance, 

in case we do not reach the required levels of localization. Besides compliance risk, we 

must also face the multi-ethnicity within our organization with persistent efforts to 

maintain cultural harmony within the organization as part of managing staff attrition rate 

and creating opportunities for personal development of all employees. 

 

The In-Kingdom Total Value Add (“IKTVA”) Program 

 

IKTVA is Saudi Aramco’s program for encouraging Saudi localization, the 

ultimate aim of which is to achieve 70% localization by the year 2021. IKTVA looks at 

various factors, such as localized goods and services, salaries paid to Saudis, training &amp; 

development to Saudis, etc. 

 

Since Saudi Aramco is one of Atlantic Group’s key clients, we should make sure 

to hire ample Saudi nationals in order to contribute towards IKTVA, and in return reap 

current and future benefits of working with Saudi Aramco. 

 

The In-Country Value (“ICV”) Program 

 

 

ICV is ADNOC’s program for encouraging Emirati localization, aiming to improve 

knowledge transfer and create job opportunities for UAE nationals. As part of this, 

ADNOC requires its suppliers to declare their localization achievements by meeting 

several criteria to ultimately acquire the ICV certificate. This certificate is then verified by 

a third-party annually. 

 


 

41 

 



Since ADNOC is also one of Atlantic Group’s key clients, we should make sure to 

hire ample Emirati nationals in order to comply with the ICV certificate criteria, and in 

return reap current and future benefits of working with Saudi Aramco. 

 

4.B.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

Saudi Localization 

 

Atlantic Group plans to grow both its operational and administrative staff to include 

more Saudi nationals. Specifically, we will continue to recruit and train more Saudi citizens 

as marine crew to ensure that we meet the quota for Saudi crew, specifically in vessels 

serving Saudi Aramco. 

 

Further, we plan to procure more services from approved Saudi contractors to meet 

our IKTVA targets. 

 

Emirati Localization 

 

Atlantic Group is aiming to continue to hire ample number of Emirati nationals. 

We are currently working with a consultancy firm on our ICV certification to ensure that 

it is qualified for work with ADNOC. Specifically, in line with ICV criteria, we are 

planning to hire at least 100 Emirati employees in our UAE operations.

4.C. Material Topic #3: Political Risk 

 

4.C.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Political risk relates to the continuing conflict within the Gulf, which, if escalated, 

could result in uncertainty in the business environment—and potentially financial losses 

due unrest, damages, policy changes, etc. 

 

Changes in the political environment has caused restrictions in access to a number 

of offshore fields and the associated activities and clients. In some cases, it actually resulted 

in unavailability of previously existing work opportunities and developments, and deeper 

isolation and restrictions in terms of accessing operating areas. 

 

Recently, Atlantic Group’s business has been further influenced by the impact of 

the political developments in Qatar and KSA, as we had specifically been impacted in areas 

of banking practices, procurement and logistics support in vessels operating in those areas.  

 

4.C.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

 

Obviously, Atlantic Group cannot mitigate this risk by directly reducing the 

political risk in the country in which it operates. Instead, we must be able to mitigate the 

risk through other measures, such as risk avoidance, sharing, etc. Some ways in which we 

plan to deal with political risk include: 

 

i) We are planning to enhance our awareness, foresight, and impact assessments of political 

situations in the countries in which we operate, in order to proactively identify and prepare 

for potential political risks. 

 

ii) Coordinating with insurance companies in order to “share” the political risks in a 

favorable manner. 

 

iii) Moving our operations away from politically risk locations to more politically stables 

ones. This is, of course, a very long term plan, and would first require Atlantic Group to be 

flexible enough to conveniently change location of operations. 

 

iv) Engaging consultants to adopt business continuity and crisis management measures, 

such as cold/warm/hot sites to protect data.

5.A. Material Topic #4: Profitability &amp; Cash Flow 

 

5.A.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Financial Challenges 

 

With the collapse of the oil price from over US$100 per barrel to below US$30 per 

barrel in 2015, the oil &amp; marine industry have suffered greatly—and so have we. This 

industry is composed of a large number of companies providing support services to 

National Oil Companies (“NOC”) around the world, with services that include: vessel 

ownership, shipyards, and engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning 

(EPIC). Many of these companies in the oil &amp; marine industry had already gone into 

bankruptcies. Meanwhile, 6 of our peer companies on the SGX had gone into judicial 

management or in the process of restructuring, or have had their listing status suspended. 

 

The key reason for the situation above is that while, for vessel owners, charter fees 

had collapsed by some 40% to 50%, operators had not been able to materially reduce 

operating expenses, due to the need to continue to meet the stringent criteria and demand 

of the NOCs—such as vessel requirements, employment requirements, etc. 

 

Cash flow position of vessel owners had severely weakened due to the continuing 

need to service loans and interest payment of assets that were purchased at a high price 

during the boom years (before oil prices crashed in 2015). 

 

5.A.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

Our Response 

 

We have recently completed a proposed share subscription of US$26 million, 

mainly to strengthen our cash flow position to support about US$236 million of new 

contracts secured in FY2016 from a MENOC. As a result, Atlantic Group would position 

itself for an expected upturn in the industry over the next 2 years. 

 

Specific Financial Plans 

 

The Group's specific financial plans are to: 

 

1) Return to breakeven, and/or be marginally profitable for FY2018. 

 

2) Improve our performance and cash flow in FY2019. This can be done through a 

combination of: 

 

 i) using part of the US$26 million investment to repay US$17.2 million of 

convertible loan carrying 15% interest, cash and payment in kind; 


 

46 

 



 

ii) participating in tenders with cross-chartered vessels to increase revenue from 

our MLS division; and 

 

iii) having recently completed a US$45 million deconstruction project with our 

joint venture partner, to continue to work with strategic partners on such project to diversify 

our business and reduce reliance on our core MLS business.

5.B.i. Material Sub-Topic #6.A: Age of Assets (Vessels) 

 

5.B.i.1. Current policies, practices and performance 

 

Both ADNOC and Saudi Aramco now require that vessels servicing their offshore 

fields be no more than 15 years old. Our MLS Division is a capital intensive industry, and 

the Atlantic Group’s ability to continue to meet the various demands and criteria of the 

NOCs requires a high internal program for maintenance, upkeep and also continuing 

investment and retrenchment of aging assets. Besides the requirements, this internal 

program is needed in order to meet NOCs requirements such as: 

 

• More environmentally friendly vessels 

• Technically advance vessels 

• Vessels that are economical to run 

• Stringent industry standards for HSE 

 

The Atlantic Group had, since its listing on Catalist in 2012, grown its feet from 12 

vessels to 21 vessels, and especially in higher value assets. We had over the last 2 years 

disposed of a number of our old and low-value vessels, specifically aiming to comply with 

the aging requirements. 

 

Between April 2018 and October 2018, Atlantic Group took delivery of 7 new 

vessels. As such, the Atlantic Group’s fleet is, on average per vessel, less than 5 years old. 

 

5.B.i.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

The Atlantic Group will continue to, both qualitatively and quantitatively, monitor 

its fleet to ensure that the vessels meet the evolving requirements of our key clients. While 

the Atlantic Group's fleet is young, the Atlantic Group has been and will continue to divest 

of lower value and older vessels in its fleet and to enhance its maintenance program on the 

existing vessels to ensure that its fleet continues to meet its key customer’s requirements.

5.B.ii. Material Sub-Topic #6.B: Processes, Systems, and Training 

 

5.B.ii.1. Current policies, practices, and performance 

 

Our operating entity, Atlantic Maritime Group FZE, having been established in the 

UAE for some 17 years, had relied on fundamentally legacy (old) processes and systems. 

 

In addition, given that the UAE's population profile is about 80% expatriates, our 

staff, excluding crews, comes from about 10 countries with different cultures, educational 

backgrounds, training, and work experience. 

 

The Group needs to, under existing and future industry environments, be more 

efficient, effective and competitive to ultimately be profitable moving forward, and in 

effect provide its stakeholders with reasons to be committed and to continue to invest in 

the sustainability of the Group. 

 

The current operating procedures and practices are now being reviewed in light of 

implementing a process-based risk-assessed quality control system. The process-based risk 

analysis and assessment includes evaluation and measures to prevent failures in the 

different aspects of the company’s business activities, including: offshore marine 

operations, internal communications and information flow-exchange, changes in market 

dynamics, client evaluation, risks from clients, etc. 

 

The Company will upgrade and optimize the current reporting and information 

management system to an Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) solution. The currently 

used FOCUS program actually has a full-fledged ERP version. Thus, we will gradually 

evaluate and implement the modules over the following few months. At the moment we 

are operating only the entry level of the product, which is a version of 2 generations ago. 

 

5.B.ii.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

The Atlantic Group plans to review, invest in (where necessary), and upgrade its 

processes and system, embrace new technologies, and conduct training so that its personnel 

can be more mobile, connected and able to react and respond to clients and operating 

demands in a timelier manner. 

 

Concerning systems, we are currently reviewing one system to help us enhance our 

internal processes. The system under review should enable the Atlantic Group to slice and 

dice management, commercial, and operational data in as close to real-time as possible. 

The system will enable us to respond to commercial and operational requirements, while 

also providing the increasing mobile managerial staff with connectivity and the ability to 

access the necessary data, documentation, and information as soon as possible. The system 

will also enable the Atlantic Group to virtually connect to its partners and clients in order 

to provide updated information and documentation to ensure that its clients' service 

requirements and the Atlantic Group’s obligations and commitments to the clients are met 

or preferably exceeded.

5.C. Material Topic #5: Services to Clients 

 

5.C.1. Current policies, practices, and performance 

 

Changing NOC &amp; EPC Developments 

 

The Atlantic Group's fleet composition is currently concentrated in the towing / 

supply sector of the offshore activities, which has become saturated with vessels that result 

in low utilization and low charter rates. Current charter rates and utilization cannot support 

the cost of an investment of such vessels. The offshore dynamics are currently developing 

a demand for work, vessel, high crane requirements, as well as subsea support. Not 

responding to these market changes will isolate the fleet into a small, low-earning sector 

of the offshore operations. 

 

NOC’s and EPC contractors are changing operating strategies, especially focusing 

more and more on cost reduction of operating costs, based on efficiency and optimization 

of their practices, as opposed to the just price reduction, which followed the initial market 

drop. The direct impacts of such practices are changes in the utilization per type of vessel 

and corresponding charter rates.  

 

Changing Market Trends 

 

This, together with the oversaturated offshore vessels market, has prompted an 

analysis of the Company’s fleet earning potentials and the business operating model. The 

current fleet utilization is divided between long term contracts with Saudi Aramco, and 

spot market engagement with EPC contractors and offshore contracting companies. While 

the long term Saudi Aramco engagement is a low-risk recurring revenue stream, the spot 

market utilization, which is currently supporting 50% of the Company’s fleet, is based 

mainly on the range of anchor-handling tug supply (“AHTS”) units.  

 

AHTS is currently the lower earning potential in terms of charter rate and 

utilization. The current market demand calls vessels related to “work” and various 

construction activities – including both subsea and top-site works. The market also 

demands vessels with more specialized operating specifications, such as large fuel 

capacity, draft, accommodation, crane lifting capabilities, etc. 

 

5.C.2. Future plans &amp; targets 

 

The Company’s analysis of the previously-mentioned changing developments from 

NOCs and EPCs indicates 2 main approaches in response to the said changes: 

 

1) Routing, in the interim, contractual arrangements related to specific operations through 

a non-Gulf entity, and this way eliminating trade restrictions within the Gulf countries. 

 

2) Establish independent local office(s) and presence within individual countries. 

 


 

52 

 



Additionally, to capitalize on the previously-mentioned changing current market 

demands, Atlantic Group intends to diversify on the fleet capability by expanding in 

support of different aspects of offshore construction, subsea, survey and topsite operations. 

 

The Company intends to establish an access to such vessels, either through strategic 

alliances, or suitable charters from other vessel owners, as well as enhancing the 

specifications of our own existing vessels. The main element of this strategy is that the 

Company will engage vessels in contract routed through the Company’s, where charters 

revenues from the end users are billed to our own accounts, while operating costs are born 

by the vessel owners. The Company’s main contribution and associated cost is in the 

management of such charters. These resources, however, are shared with the resources 

already in place for management of our own fleet and contracts.  

 

Enhancement of capacities for our own vessels, such as accommodation facilities, 

positioning services, and cargo capacities will allow the vessel to access not only the AHTS 

category, but also the work category. Thus, this gives preference in utilization, as well as 

allows for the sale of additional services to clients, and therefore, generates revenues in 

addition to the already low charter rates.  

 

The above strategy will allow for higher utilization of own AHTS units, which now 

can be offered as part of a complete package solution, add new revenue sources from the 

additional services the company now offers, as well as add new market share of the offshore 

operations segments. 

 

There is no requirement for capital investments, and, in terms of liability, the 

Company remains within the limits of its already established and controlled financial and 

marine offshore practices and operations. 

 

Starting with alliances and association with subsea and contracting will also allow 

for additional response measures to possible future market changes resulting in reduction 

in the vessel operating charter of AHTS.  

 

Depending on the market developments, and following the results from the initial 

contracts execution, further higher scale engagement will be evaluated.
