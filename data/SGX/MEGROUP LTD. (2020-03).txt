BOARD STATEMENT 

 

The Group has considered sustainability as part of its strategic formulation and determined 

the material ESG factors most applicable to the Group. The Board oversees the management 

and monitoring of these factors, through internal reviews of the Group's sustainability 

performance. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility are at the core of our corporate 

strategy and adhering to these twin tenets would allow the Group to create lasting and positive 

change on the communities we operate in.  

 

We are committed to our stakeholders, particularly, our employees, business partners and 

customers who purchase our products and services. This is why one of the key strategies of 

the Group is to maintain stringent and unwavering standards of quality control for the products 

produced and sold by us, whether through our supply chain of upstream manufacturing of 

automotive parts or downstream automotive retail dealerships. 

 

Our upstream manufacturing is certified to internationally recognised standards of ISO 9001 

Quality Management and IATF 16946 Automotive Management. The intention behind starting 

upstream manufacturing and downstream retail dealership business segments concurrently 

was to be able to provide a wider range of quality products and services across different areas. 

In order to align ourselves with our initial objectives, we continue to hold our products to the 

same high standard and provide bespoke products with specialised industry applications 

through research and development and close collaboration with our technical partners. 

 

In order to support long-term value creation for our stakeholders and shareholders, the Group 

adopts the precautionary principle to minimise negative effects of conducting its business 

whenever possible. The precautionary principle is a strategy for approaching issues of 

potential harm when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. It emphasizes 

caution, pausing and review before leaping into new innovations that may prove disastrous. 

 

Moving forward, it is the Group's intention to expand the scope of our sustainability report to 

include sustainability practices with respect to our downstream retail dealerships operations 

in Malaysia. The Group will also include more quantitative criterion and targets in the 

forthcoming sustainability report.

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK  

 

The Group acknowledges the importance of putting in place an effective ESG strategy and 

management across the different facets of the business operations. To this end, the Group 

has established a Sustainability Committee, led by key management executives of the Group 

and supported by representatives from various departments in the Group, with principal 

charge of the Group's ESG strategy. The Sustainability Committee reports to the Board and is 

responsible for reviewing the Group’s sustainability performance, material topics, stakeholder 

concerns, the setting of targets for material topics, and establishing systems to collect, verify, 

and monitor information required for the sustainability reports.  

 

We are aware of the risks and impact associated with the industry we operate in and 

endeavour to identify, evaluate and prevent these risks whenever possible. The Board 

approves the Group’s general policies and strategies including those relating to sustainability 

and are satisfied that the framework in place is sufficient to ensure that the Group's 

sustainability risks and issues are managed and mitigated effectively.

KEY STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT 

 

We recognise that engagement with all of our stakeholder groups (including the receiving of 

feedback) forms an integral part of our sustainability strategy and initiatives. As such the 

Group takes steps to proactively engage our stakeholders through a variety of channels. 

Through such engagement, our stakeholders are updated on the Group's developments; in 

addition, the Group is able to receive feedback which would in turn allow us to tailor our 

sustainability strategy and initiatives.  

 

We recognise that continual engagement and communication with these key stakeholders are 

vital to the longevity of our business and being open to their feedback would allow us to 

identify and prioritise the sustainability issues that matter to them the most. We have identified 

stakeholders as groups that have an impact, or have the potential to be impacted by our 

business, as well as external organisations that have expertise in aspects that we consider 

material. We would also be continually refreshing our list of key stakeholders to ensure that 

the people most crucial to our materiality assessment process will be involved.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

The Group has applied the relevant GRI Standards to identify and prioritise sustainability topics 

to tailor its approach taken in relation to sustainability centres on the management of the ESG 

impacts of its business operations on its stakeholders. MeGroup’s strategy is to manage its 

most significant sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities while keeping in mind the aim 

of creating long-term value for all its stakeholders.

The Group had identified the material ESG factors using the GRI Standards for Sustainability 

reporting and through internal sessions with internal stakeholders to understand their 

concerns and emerging priorities. Each material issue was discussed in detail, taking into 

account both the internal and external perspectives in relation to our sustainable development 

performance. Such discussions would allow us to constantly evolve and provides us with the 

opportunity to collaborate with these different stakeholders in order to resolve or facilitate the 

resolution of any problem efficiently. We will, from time to time, be updating our materiality 

analysis to ensure that the material issues stay relevant.  

 

The Group undertook the following steps to arrive at the list of material factors for reporting:

Following the findings of the internal materiality analysis, the most relevant concerns for the 

Group that were identified are:  

(1) 

Corporate Governance 

(2) 

Data Privacy 

(3) 

Economic Performance 

(4) 

Occupational Health and Safety 

(5) 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

(6) 

Environment 

 

Moving forward, the Group seeks to share more information on its performance and targets 

after the production capacity in our upstream manufacturing has been fully integrated and 

our downstream retail dealerships have been established. 

 

The Board has, after assessing ESG related business risks and opportunities and ESG related 

issues in the financial services sector, subsequently reviewed, determined and approved these 

material topics for reporting.  

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

The Group recognises the importance of observing a high standard of corporate governance 

and transparency in ensuring the sustainability of our businesses and safeguarding our 

stakeholders’ interests and value for the long term. We are committed to complying with all 

industry requirements and legislation relating to trading, accounting, financial reporting, 

internal controls and auditing.  

 

We are committed to upholding best practices in corporate transparency and disclosures, and 

have in place a set of procedures and policies to ensure adherence to our risk management 

guidelines and compliance with applicable legislation. We are also committed to operating 

with utmost integrity and to the highest standard of ethical principles. We maintain a zero-

tolerance policy for any form of bribery, fraud or corruption. If any of our employees are found 

to be non-compliant with anti-corruption and anti-bribery principles, they may face disciplinary 

action or termination. We regularly apprise our employees on the need to conduct business 

at the highest ethical standards and the need to exhibit honesty, integrity and respect in our 

dealings and interactions within and outside the Group. 

 

Our Board has established stringent standards for employees, officers and directors. In 

carrying out one of the principal functions of the Board, which is to oversee the formulation 

of and approve the Group's overall long-term strategic objectives and direction, the Board 

would consider issues of sustainability, review the management of the Group's business 

affairs, performance, resource allocation and also establish a framework to manage risks and 

prioritise shareholder's interests and the Group's assets.

We continue to comply with the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018, where appropriate. We hereby confirm that there was no incident of 

regulatory non-compliance by the Group and no incident pertaining to whistle-blowing for this 

reporting period under review. 

 

DATA PRIVACY 

 

We are committed to complying with all applicable data privacy laws, (including the Personal 

Data Protection Act 2012 in Singapore, Personal Data Protection Act 2010 in Malaysia and all 

relevant legislation). We have various systems and procedures in place to protect information 

related to our employees and customers. Customers can trust that their personal data is being 

collected, handled, and protected in a responsible and secure manner.  

 

Moving forward, we will continue to stay vigilant and observe compliance with all applicable 

laws and regulations and target to maintain our record of nil incidents of non-compliance. 

 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

The Group's economic performance is crucial for shareholders and employees as it is 

considered a material issue at MeGroup and is one of the primary ways we create value for 

all stakeholders. Our business growth and economic performance would have a positive 

impact our employees and stakeholders as this would allow us to generate economic value 

and provide continued stable employment for our employees.  

 

The Group targets to achieve sustainable growth in the coming years through strengthening 

our two core business segments:  

a) 

upstream manufacturing, and  

b) 

downstream retail dealerships.  

 

while we continue to raise market awareness for our broad range of products under 

distinguished proprietary brand names, particularly in our downstream retail dealerships with 

a total of 9 dealerships under 6 brand names i.e. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mitsubishi 

and Peugeot. 

 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

As a responsible employer, the Group aims to address and prevent the variety of health and 

safety risks that employees are exposed to, wherever possible. Health and safety hazards can 

arise over the use of unsafe equipment, machinery, processes and practises. They can also 

arise with the use of dangerous substances such as chemical. Therefore, we are continuously 

working towards the minimisation of the risk of accidents, injuries and illnesses to our 

employees, contractors and place health and safety as top priority in our operations.

MeGroup is committed to achieving Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) excellence 

through: 

✓ compliance with applicable WSH legislations and regulations as well as other requirements 

to which we subscribe; 

✓ consistently establishing and maintaining WSH management performance; 

✓ operating and maintaining our facilities to prevent and minimise risks to the health and 

safety of our employees and surrounding communities; and 

✓ ongoing communication of our WSH policy to all parties. 

 

The Group constantly monitors the working conditions of its employees to ensure that they 

comply with national standards issued by government agencies or associations such as 

Department of Occupational Safety and Health (“DOSH”). The Management is wholly 

committed to complying with the local occupational health and safety and all other relevant 

regulations. The Group implements a comprehensive safety management system to ensure 

the health, safety and welfare of all its employees and people in the community who may be 

affected by its operations. 

 

The Group prioritises process safety, especially in relation to the Group's upstream 

manufacturing, and is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy workforce. Management 

actively ensures that the Group's Standard Operating Procedures are complied with, including 

the provision of Personal Protection Equipment, as may be necessary, to its employees. Our 

Employee Health and Safety and Fire Safety Committees, which comprise staff from each 

relevant department of the Group and which are advised by the Group's registered safety 

officers, oversee the implementation of the WSH management plan, and reviews such WSH 

management plans on a monthly basis. 

 

For FY2020, the Group had set the following goals: 

 

Objectives 

Goal 

Workplace Safety and Health Complaint 

 

Zero (0) Cases 

Industrial Accident 

 

Zero (0) Cases 

 

Due in part to the Group's prioritising safety and the health of our workers, the Group is 

pleased to report that it achieved its goal of zero cases of WSH complaints and industrial 

accidents for FY2020, and fully complied with WSH and environmental inspections conducted 

by the authorities. We also recorded no cases of work-related ill health.

In respect of workplace safety and insurances, certain of our employees fall under the ambit 

of the Social Security Organisation (“SOCSO”) of Malaysia. SOCSO oversees the 

administration, implementation and enforcement of the Employees' Social Security Act 1969 

and the Employees' Social Security (General) Regulations 1971 in Malaysia, and provides 

employees with security protection social insurance through various schemes, including the 

Employment Injury Scheme and the Invalidity Scheme. The Employment Injury Scheme 

provides coverage to employees who are victims of industrial accidents, commuting accidents, 

accidents during emergency and occupational diseases. The Invalidity Scheme provides 24-

hour protection to employees against invalidity or death which is caused outside working 

hours, even if the cause is not related to their employment. Both of these schemes provide 

cash benefits to employees and their dependants in the event of unforeseen incidents.

At MeGroup, we believe in upholding the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and 

endeavour to employ based on merit as we understand that the success of our Group turns 

upon the quality and dedication of our employees. We do not discriminate our employees or 

potential recruits according to their race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, 

physical impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality. We strive to 

provide a fair, performance-based working environment that is diverse, inclusive and 

collegiate. 

 

Employees with questions or concerns about discrimination in the workplace are encourage 

to bring these issues to the attention to their supervisor and are able to raise such concerns 

without any fear of reprisal.  

 

As of 31 March 2019, we have more than 100 employees in our upstream manufacturing 

operations and corporate office. In the assessment of our people's performance, we practise 

meritocracy and believe in providing due recognition for their excellence. We also implement 

remuneration packages that are competitive within the market and are internally fair in order 

to attract external talents.  

 

We also provide learning and development resources so as to make available ample 

opportunities for our people to better themselves through internal courses or on-the-job 

training in the areas of technical and functional competencies. We target to increase the 

competence of our employees through the internal training programs such as leadership and 

personality training so that they are able to contribute effectively to the Group. 

 

ENVIRONMENT 

 

The minimisation of our environmental footprint impact is one of the key objectives of the 

Group in relation to the environment. By minimising our environmental footprint, this would 

achieve a twofold benefit where we would be conducting our business in a socially responsible 

manner and benefit from reducing operational costs for example, through the reduction in the 

use of electricity by utilising more energy efficient appliances. Moving forward, we target to 

introduce more energy saving measures throughout our operations of the Group, while still 

maintaining the other conservation initiatives which we have already put in place.  

 

There were no incidents of non-compliance and penalties pertaining to environmental-related 

issues in this reporting period under review. The Board and Management continue to review 

and improve current environmental management system and practices and ensure that all our 

activities and operations comply with regulatory and customers’ requirements.
