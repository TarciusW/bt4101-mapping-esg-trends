Ltd. The report outlines the Group’s sustainability strategies, 

initiatives and performance in relation to Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”)	 issues	 for	 the	 financial	 year	

ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). Through this report, we 

hope to share our sustainability commitments with our various 

stakeholders, including investors, customers, business partners, 

suppliers,	staff,	the	community	and	government	and	regulators.

STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE

As	one	of	the	leading	distributors	of	semiconductor	and	electronic	components	in	the	Asia	Pacific	region	and	expanding	into	the	

consumer products distribution and managed print services, the Group strives for sustainable growth as we seek to generate long-

term value and sustainable returns for our stakeholders in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. We established and 

periodically review our sustainability strategy in view of the existing and emerging risks and opportunities.

The Board has overall responsibility for sustainability for the Group and plans to ensure that our growth is sustainable in the long 

term. The Board determines material ESG factors for sustainability strategy formulation and reporting.

REPORTING FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the sustainability reporting regulatory requirements set out in the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited Listing Manual ("SGX-ST Listing Manual"): Listing Rules 711A and 711B, and the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option. A materiality assessment, taking into consideration the expectations of our stakeholders, 

was conducted to identify and prioritise ESG factors that are material to our Group’s operations. No independent assurance has 

been obtained for this Report.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

The Group’ sustainability journey involves identifying our stakeholders and material aspects relevant to our business. Formal 

and informal channels of communication were adopted with both internal and external stakeholders to understand their needs, 

interests and priorities. This enables us to strategise our business decisions and operations, thereby ensuring the growth of our 

business operations and stakeholders’ satisfaction.

The following illustrates the approach the Group undertakes to engage with our key stakeholders:

Value and Supply Chain

The Group is committed to embrace responsible business practices across our operations and supply chain by collaborating with 

transparent,	ethical,	environmentally	and	socially	responsible	suppliers.	As	such,	we	have	established	a	stringent	pre-qualification	

and procurement process to ensure the quality of our supply chain. All our suppliers and customers are required to undergo 

restricted party screening through our automated denied party screening software which comprise the database from government 

authorities and international organizations. Our logistics service providers are also frequently assessed against their suitability 

and capability to meet our Group’s requirements as well as their adherence with Singapore Customs requirements. We aim to 

progressively strengthen our supply chain processes in FY2021.

SERIAL SYSTEM’s COVID-19 RESPONSE

Despite the pandemic, we remain committed to our sustainability program and have proactively implemented measures to 

safeguard our employees in 11 countries while continuing our operations as an essential service during the Coronavirus Disease 

2019 (“Covid-19”) crisis. We continue to follow closely with the regulations set by the local governments in all regions where we 

operate to keep our team safe and help prevent the spread of disease.

Employee health, safety and well-being

As part of our business continuity plan, we formed a management-led pandemic advisory committee and vigilantly communicated 

the novel coronavirus advisory notice from Ministry of Health to all our employees as early as January 2020. To ensure our employee 

safety and well-being, we established early protocols to reduce the risk of exposure, including remote work and separate teams 

to	minimise	the	number	of	employees	working	on-site,	stepped	up	cleaning	of	office	areas	and	implemented	social	distancing	

measures. We also communicated regularly with our employees on work arrangement plans and standard operating procedures 

which were drawn up in response to Covid-19 scenarios.

Ensure resilience of business

As much as possible, we maintained the business-as-usual scenario in our operations and remained as an essential service during 

Covid-19 crisis. From January 2020, we put in place and communicated to our employees a series of travel and quarantine notices. 

During Covid-19 circuit breaker, we commenced split-team operations and telecommuting. Visitors and employees are required 

to perform mandatory temperature screening at our guardhouse. Anyone having a fever upon temperature screening will not be 

allowed entry. On top of that, all employees and visitors are required to submit a health and travel declaration form. 

OUR ECONOMIC

Economic Performance

We are committed to creating sustainable and long-term business growth, while creating value and positive contributions for our 

marketplace and customers, the communities we operate in, our people and the environment.

Our economic performance in 2020 has been hampered by the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19 outbreak and adverse 

market	conditions.	We	will	continue	to	find	ways	to	be	and	remain	resilient	in	the	face	of	some	major	changes	and	challenges	

to our business. By sustaining our energy and motivation, we will build stronger global partnerships with existing and potential 

suppliers and customers, with a focus on our core electronic components distribution business. Over the years, the Group has also 

diversified	into	consumer	products	distribution,	managed	print	services,	investment	holding	of	high-profit	margin	companies	and	

other businesses to provide additional income streams with a view to enhance shareholders’ value over the long term.

As a company listed on the Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”), we publish a detailed annual report comprising our risk manage-

ment,	corporate	governance	and	financial	performance.	A	summary	of	our	economic	performance	is	provided	below,	in	line	with	

the	GRI	Standards.	For	detailed	financial	results,	please	refer	to	the	financial	statements	in	our	Annual	Report	2020:

FY2020 vs FY2019 - Electricity &amp; Energy Consumption Performance

Electricity 

Consumption

(KWH ‘000)

We strived to continuously review our growth strategies in order to enhance our value proposition as a distribution intermediary 

between chipmakers and manufacturers of electronic end-products. As an established distributor with one of the largest networks 

in	Asia	Pacific,	our	wide	network	of	suppliers	and	customer	base,	particularly	in	Greater	China,	stems	from	many	years	of	hard	

work and building trust. This extensive network, combined with a proven track record with our localised management model 

further reinforces our value proposition as a distributor which gives us an advantage over our competitors. We expect to continue 

this trade for many more years and remain an integral part of the international supply chain for chipmakers, original equipment 

manufacturers and major electronic brands.

OUR ENVIRONMENT

Environment Protection

We	are	committed	to	minimising	our	environmental	impact	and	utilizing	our	resources	efficiently.	Our	current	environmental	

impact	may	be	attributed	to	the	use	of	electricity	and	paper	in	our	offices	and	warehouses,	the	use	of	fuel	in	transportation	for	

deliveries of products. While our existing carbon footprint from electricity consumption is relatively small, we understand the 

value of reducing energy consumption to mitigate the threat of climate change. We have also reduce on printing and presently, 

use recycled papers whenever possible. Through regular monitoring of our resource consumption, we strive to minimize our impact 

on the environment as we continuously encourage our employees to think and act green.

Energy Consumption and Emissions

Given the nature of our operations, electricity from the grid and fuel consumption in transportation of products to customers via 

air	or	sea	freight	are	the	main	sources	of	energy	consumed	at	our	sites.	Our	offices	in	Singapore,	Hong	Kong	and	China	accounted	

for	82%	of	the	total	electricity	consumed.	We	have	also	put	up	reminders	in	our	offices	to	switch	off	office	lights	and	air	conditioners	

when not in use and periodically remind our employees about it.

Based on available data through statements from utility providers in the territories that the Group operates in, the Group managed 

to achieve reduction in electricity consumption in FY2020 (1,764,748 kWh) from FY2019 (2,059,590 kWh). The Group’s energy 

intensity per employee decreased to 9 GJ in FY2020 from 10.2 GJ in FY2019. The decrease is brought about by the Covid-19 outbreak 

whereby	most	staff	are	telecommuting	except	for	our	warehouse	operations	staff.	We	have	also	streamlined	and	delayered	many	

functions, thereby reducing our overall cost structure and energy utilisation. The Group’s building energy intensity decreased from 

69.7 kWh/m2 in FY2019 to 58.1 kWh/m2 in FY2020. In line with our building energy intensity, the Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”) emissions 

intensity	for	our	offices	reduced	in	FY2020	(41.2	kgCO2e/m2) from FY2019 (49.3 kgCO2e/m2). We will strive to maintain or reduce 

the building energy and CO2 emissions intensity in FY2021.

For operations, there was also a slight increase in emissions intensity by revenue in FY2020 (1.16 gCO2e) from FY2019 (1.07 gCO2e). 

During FY2020, the use of air freight shipment mode, which is the highest CO2 emission transportation mode,   has increased as the 

more	energy	efficient	shipping	lines	cancelled	their	sailings	due	to	drastic	drop	in	overall	market	demand	during	initial	phase	of	

the pandemic outbreak. Airfreight continues to be the main mode of transport for the Group to facilitate our sales. It is our goal to 

strive to continually reduce our emissions of Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”) and play our part to alleviate the impact of global warming. 

We hope to realise this objective next year by better consolidation of our inventories to be transported and reduce the use of air 

freight since air freight generally emits more CO2 per-kilometre than sea freight.

Water Conservation

Our water use is limited to employee consumption and facility maintenance. While it isn’t a material issue for us, we strive to 

reduce water consumption and prevent water pollution as our operations can still be impacted in areas where the availability of 

clean water is lacking and sanitation is of concern. We increase awareness of our employees by displaying signs in designated areas 

to serve as a friendly reminder to water users.

Our water consumption and its intensity reduced to 6,580 m3 and 0.217 m3/m2 in FY2020 from 7,342 m3 and 0.249 m3/m2 respectively 

in FY2019. We have achieved our target in FY2020 and are committed to maintain or reduce our water consumption intensity in 

FY2021.

Materials and Waste

Paper is the main sources of waste generated across our Group’s operations. We focus on reducing and recycling our own waste 

to minimise our environmental impact in this area. We continued to lower our environmental footprint by reducing paper costs 

from	printing	and	copying	in	our	Singapore	Head	Office.	Our	Singapore	Head	Office	paper	consumption	level	was	reduced	in	FY2020	

(367,138 pcs) from FY2019 level (462,425 pcs).

As part of our ongoing Group’s initiatives to go digital, we are moving towards digital transactions to reduce paper usage and to 

boost productivity. For FY2020, we managed to reduce paper usage by 48% when compared to FY2018. A gap analysis was also 

performed	to	streamline	current	business	processes	through	digitisation	of	employees’	claims	submission	and	archival	of	finance	

and human resources related documents, in order to further reduce paper usage. In quest of further productivity gains, we 

continue to roll out robotic process automation (“RPA”)	to	our	offices	in	South	Korea	and	Philippines.	These	offices,	together	with	

our	Singapore	office,	are	currently	using	RPA	to	semi-automate	the	extraction	of	portable	document	formatted	sales	orders	into	

data	up-loadable	to	our	financial	system	which	eliminates	manual	effort	in	recording.

On top of that, we encouraged our employees to use shared data folders when accessing information to reduce the need for 

printing. We also adopted the conventional method of reusing one-sided used papers that are without any company and private 

confidential	information.	These	paperless	and	paper	reduction	initiatives	have	helped	our	Singapore	Head	Office	to	reduce	the	

total printing costs by about 23% from FY2019. We aim to record, monitor and reduce our paper consumption level for the entire 

Group’s operations by next year.

2019

Our people, our greatest asset, are key to the Group’s long term growth and success. We have a diverse workforce comprising 

employees across various regions. During FY2020, our total headcount reduced by 3% to 709 compared to 728 in FY2019 due to 

adverse market conditions and outbreak of Covid-19. We also welcomed 132 new employees to our Group in FY2020.

All our employees work full-time on a permanent contract. We have employees located in the South Asia and in countries such as 

China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. 85% of employees are based in China, Hong Kong and South Asia where the majority 

of our business in electronic components and consumer products distributions is based. 96% of our department heads, in 

Singapore Head	Office,	are	Singaporeans	or	Permanent	Residents	hired	from	our	local	community.

Our global attrition rate decreased in 2020 (27%) from 2019 (48%). The lower attrition rate was mainly due to the pandemic 

outbreak whereby the employment market has declined. This has aligned with the attrition rate in China which had reduced in 

2020	by	about	27%	also	due	to	the	pandemic	outbreak.	Other	than	that,	the	attrition	figures	were	resulted	from	multiple	variables,	

including operational decisions, market conditions, generation trends and cultural tendencies.

Diversity and Inclusive

We are committed to providing an inclusive workplace with equal opportunities through employment, remuneration, training and 

promotion	of	staff	regardless	of	gender,	race,	nationality	and	family	status.	Our	Group	has	a	diversified	workforce	across	all	age	

groups. In FY2020, about 50% of our workforce consists of millennials who have helped to infuse new perspectives, passion and 

efficiency.

We maintained a balanced female-male ratio (43% female and 57% male) in our workforce across all regions. In FY2020, we 

increased the new hire rate of male employees in our Group by 10% over FY2020 as well as hiring more employees in the under 30 

age category.

We respect and support the international principles of human rights. Our HR policies ban child labour, forced or compulsory labour, 

as well as discrimination. There was no reported incident of child labour, forced or compulsory labour and discrimination in FY2020.

Clear guidelines on workplace abuse, harassment and disciplinary matters are established and communicated to all employees. 

Employees are also encouraged to report any grievance through their immediate supervisor. Should any further assistance or 

investigation required, cases will be directed to the HR department. No grievances were reported in FY2020.

Training and Development

Learning and development within our Group is a decentralized function as each country/region adopts its own approach based 

on employees’ needs and resources. We actively encourage our employees to enhance and continuously develop their skills 

and knowledge, and also provide sponsorship for them should they express a desire to attend external courses or seminars. By 

empowering	our	staff	with	equitable	access	to	the	right	resources	and	looking	after	their	well-being,	we	help	them	to	be	their	best	

at work, grooming them to be our leaders of tomorrow. Apart from these formal training programmes or seminars, our employees 

also receive in-house and on the job training to develop their technical knowledge and relevant skillsets. We will continue to 

explore means to enhance our employees’ knowledge and skills for building a resilient workforce.

In	FY2020,	our	employees	had	benefited	from	a	total	of	528	hours	of	formal	training.	With	the	onset	of	Covid-19	pandemic,	the	

formal training hours were not reduced as we have embarked on online training programs for employees. Besides investing in 

employee’s development, we strive to ensure that our employees are provided with the right platform to progress their careers. 

The HR department monitors and tracks employees’ years of services and their career progression. We also believe in linking 

rewards to performance and have established the Long Service Award to recognise employees’ commitment to us. 

We carry out annual performance appraisal reviews, which provide employees with constructive feedback based on their 

performance, goals they set at the beginning of the year and a set of shared leadership competencies.

Occupational Health and Safety

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) of our people is of utmost importance to us. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, additional 

precautionary measures have also been put in place to ensure the safety of our employees.

Effective	OHS	management	is	part	of	risk	management	and	expected	to	enhance	business	efficiency	and	staff	morale.	Across	

our Group, we adopt and comply with the ISO45001:2018 standards that also set out our OHS Policy which is put in place to 

guide	implementation	of	initiatives	that	promote	OHS.	As	we	are	certified	ISO	22301	(Business	Continuity	Management	System),	

it is required that we measure, monitor, evaluate and analyse our OHS. Through proactively tracking and taking accountability 

of reportable and reported incidents, it helps to create awareness on the importance of a safe and healthy workplace. The 

importance of complying with all relevant laws and legislations in countries where we operate is communicated repeatedly to our 

business divisions. Any case of non-compliance will have to be directly reported to our HR department and management for prompt 

follow-up actions to be taken. Our Business Continuity Management System has been externally audited by a third-party accredited 

certification	body	to	ISO	22301,	a	recognized	international	standard	for	Business	Continuity	Management	(“BCM”).

In FY2020, we recorded zero fatalities, severe injuries and occupational diseases involving our employees across the Group. Our 

safety statistics for FY2020 remain below the industry average of wholesale and retail trade activities reported by the Ministry of 

Manpower in 2020 Workplace Safety and Health Report and we strive to achieve the same record in FY2021.

Local Community Involvement

As a responsible corporate citizen, we share in the concerns of our community and take on the responsibility for its improvement by 

actively giving back to our local community to enrich people’s lives. This is done through our various Corporate Social Responsibility 

(“CSR”)	initiatives	and	efforts.	Over	the	years,	we	had	supported	several	activities	for	the	elderly,	the	poor	and	needy,	as	well	as	

areas like healthcare, education, youth development, arts, culture and heritage. While our annual Lunar New Year celebrations 

visits to Tai Pei Old Folks Home have been put on hold in view of the health guidelines issued by the Singapore government to curb 

the spread of COVID-19, we continue to donate to various charitable foundations and programmes in FY2020. 

In FY2020, we donated a total of S$122,000 to various causes and organisations in Singapore. The Group has also pledged to donate 

S$100,000 annually to Sian Chay Medical Instituition, for a total period of 10 years, which amounts to S$1 million to provide 

medical	services	to	low	income	families	of	all	races	and	religion.	For	more	details	on	the	Company’s	CSR	efforts,	please	refer	to	

page 18 of our Annual Report 2020.

OUR GOVERNANCE

We are committed to build ethical and transparent business through a framework of sound corporate governance principles, 

practices and processes, to protect and enhance our shareholder value.  

Corporate Governance

We believe that good corporate governance nurtures sound business decisions and organizational performance resulting in 

strengthened resilience and competitive advantage. The Group remains focused on complying with the principles of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018 ("Code") in achieving operational excellence and delivering long-term strategic objectives. The Board 

of Directors is responsible for the Company’s corporate governance standards and policies, and emphasizing their importance to 

the Group.

Our	Board	of	Directors	has	considered	the	benefits	of	diversity	of	Board	Members’	skills,	experience	and	background,	and	maintains	

the view that the current Board size and structure is adequate for the existing business operations of the Group. Each director has 

been appointed on the strength of his calibre, experience and stature and is expected to bring valuable range of experience and 

expertise to contribute to the development of the Group’s long-term strategy and business performance.

We scored 84 points and improved our ranking from 461 in 2019 to 75 in 2020 from a list of 570 listed companies in the Singapore 

Governance and Transparency Index 2020 by CPA Australia, NUS Business School’s Centre for Governance, Institutions and 

Organisations, and Singapore Institute of Directors.

For detailed disclosure on the application of our corporate governance practices with reference to the Code, please refer to the 

Corporate Governance Report on page 25 to 43 in the Annual Report 2020. Where there are deviations from any of the principles 

of the Code, an explanation has been provided within the Corporate Governance Report.

Business Code of Ethics

Our business principles and practices regarding subjects that may face ethical implications are outlined in an internal code of 

business and ethical conduct, The Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct provides clear guidance for employees to observe our 

principles such as integrity, honesty, responsibility and accountability across all levels of our organization in the course of carrying 

out their duties. It is published on our corporate website and easily accessible by all employees and stakeholders.

The Code of Conduct provides guidance on matters such as:

• Conflict	of	interest	and	their	appropriate	disclosures

• Maintaining fair dealing in the conduct of our business and in our relationship with our customers, suppliers and employees

• Our stance against bribery and corruption

• Safeguarding	personal	data	and	proper	handling	of	confidential	information

• Compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those relating to insider trading and personal data protection

New hires, as part of their induction programme, are orientated with information about our Code of Conduct as well as other 

related corporate policies, including anti-bribery and corruption, whistle-blowing and business continuity.

Anti-bribery and Corruption

Corruption	can	result	in	significant	damage	to	the	organization,	such	as	loss	of	financial	and	social	capital.	We	adopt	a	zero-

tolerance approach towards corruption and continue to manage the exposure to corruption risks by applying and emphasising good 

corporate governance, business ethics and transparency while applying robust internal controls.

At Serial System Ltd, we prohibit corruption in any form, including but not limiting to extortion and bribery. We require all 

employees,	 officers	 and	 directors	 to	 conduct	 business	 with	 integrity,	 transparency,	 and	 in	 compliance	 with	 applicable	 legal	

requirements	relating	to	bribery,	corruption,	anti-money	laundering	and	terrorism	financing.	This	has	been	communicated	clearly	

to all employees, customers, suppliers and business partners.

The Company has in place a whistle-blowing policy which enables an employee to report or raise concerns over any “wrongdoings” 

across	 the	 Group	 in	 relation	 to	 unlawful	 conduct,	 financial	 malpractice	 or	 danger	 to	 the	 public	 or	 environment	 directly	 to	

the	chairman	of	the	Audit	Committee,	with	the	“whistle-blower”	who	has	acted	in	good	faith,	being	provided	confidentially,	

victimisation and harassment protection. The whistle-blowing channels (either via postal address, telephone, mobile or email 

address) that are accessible via our corporate website: www.serialsystem.com by all stakeholders provide them with secure 

platforms to raise their concerns. “Wrongdoings” can include fraud, corruption, theft, abuse of authority, breach of regulations or 

non-compliance with the Group’s Code of Conduct, internal controls and procedures.

On an ongoing basis, the whistle-blowing policy is covered during employee training and periodic communication including e-mail 

sent	quarterly	to	all	employees	as	part	of	the	Group’s	efforts	to	promote	awareness	of	anti-corruption	and	fraud	prevention.	

We will regularly review our policies on anti-bribery corruption and whistle-blowing to ensure that they are updated taking into 

account	any	related	changes	in	legal	and	regulatory	requirements.	Internal	audits	are	conducted	to	ensure	the	efficiency	and	

effectiveness	of	our	internal	controls,	risk	management	and	governance	processes.

There	were	zero	confirmed	incidents	of	corruption	in	FY2019	and	FY2020	and	we	aim	to	maintain	this	track	record	in	the	subsequent	

reporting periods.


SERIAL SYSTEM LTD / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Regulatory Compliance

The	Group	has	not	been	subject	to	any	fines	or	sanctions	for	contravention	of	any	laws	or	regulations	globally,	including	those	

relating	to	infringements	of	environment,	health	and	safety,	anti-money	laundering	and	corruption,	terrorism	financing,	export	

control laws, cybersecurity and data privacy and international trade compliance. We strive to maintain this track record and ensure 

all queries/allegations received are promptly investigated and addressed, failing which may result in either public allegations of 

non-compliance	or	significant	fines	being	levied	on	the	Group.

Through our materiality assessment, we recognise that our core business faces increased risks regarding export control laws, anti-

bribery and corruption and data governance due to the nature of our business and workforce presence across various countries 

and regions. We are committed to complying with laws and regulations wherever the Group operates in. Regular training and 

communication	are	provided	to	employees	to	keep	them	updated	on	the	compliance	issues	that	affect	their	functions	as	we	strive	

to maintain compliance with existing policies and procedures at all times.

The Group has introduced various policies to guide its business conduct, including Export Control Compliance Policy (“ECCP”), 

Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”) and Personal Data Protection Policy (“PDP Policy”). We have also ensured our 

compliance with the government advisories on Covid-19 restrictions such as social distancing and temporary measures. Altogether, 

these measures have been embedded into our daily operations to ensure business continuity in the changing operational landscape. 

Other mandatory measures are still in place, such as temperature screening, split operations and telecommuting as a default. 

As at the publication of this report, we have no instances of non-compliance with the Covid-19 laws and regulations.

Export Control Laws

The	Group	does	our	part	in	maintaining	international	peace	and	security	by	having	in	place	country-specific	ECCP	which	sets	the	

framework of operational controls and protocols for the respective business division’s transactions, to be conducted in compliance 

with applicable export control laws and regulations. In order to facilitate our screening reviews, we engage the system and 

service	of	an	ISO-certified	third-party	outsourced	vendor.	Likewise,	any	updates	to	existing	laws	and	regulations	are	programmed	

accordingly by them. Our International Trade Compliance (“ITC”) team also periodically reviews and communicates major/urgent 

updates to key personnel or regional ITC gatekeepers and management on a need to know basis

To further strengthen our commitments and minimise the risk of non-compliance, the Group requires all new employees to undergo 

an export control awareness training. Additionally, all existing employees are required to attend a refresher training every 18 

months	to	keep	them	up-to-date	on	the	compliance	issues	that	may	affect	their	functions.

In FY2020, similar to FY2019, the Group has complied with all relevant export control laws and work closely with suppliers to 

minimize disruption to our Group’s business operations. The Group endeavours to maintain its compliance status moving forward.

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

The pace of digitalization has far exceeded regulation to control and manage data privacy and protection, resulting in data 

breaches that can compromise data and cost millions. The Group continues to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure and systems 

to enhance our defence against cyber threats and attacks. On top of that, the Group has in place appropriate measures to handle 

data	confidentiality	and	integrity.	

Besides establishing Group-wide IT policies and procedures, our Group IT has:

• Implemented access controls and data security

• Raised employee’s IT security awareness by emailing notices or articles covering the latest cyber threats and their prevention

measures, phishing alerts and cyberattacks

• Conducted annual IT disaster recovery exercise to ensure business recovery objectives are met

Safeguarding the personal data of our customers, suppliers and all other stakeholders is also of utmost importance to us. The 

Group conducts our business in compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) in Singapore. Accordingly we had put 

in place a Personal Data Protection Policy which governs the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data. This policy is 

made available to the public on our corporate website. In accordance with the PDPA, the Group has designated Data Protection 

Officers	who	have	undergone	proper	training	conducted	by	a	renowned	compliance	solution	provider.

Every year, all new employers must go through our Personal Data Protection Policy and acknowledge their understanding over the 

prevailing risks, handling and protection of sensitive corporate data. We continue to educate our employees by conducting training 

programs when there are any changes in the legislation. We aim to complete the development of our online refresher training 

course for PDPA by end of 2021.

In FY2020, apart from no major cybersecurity incident that has occurred, there was no substantiated complaint from outside 

parties and from the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). We will continue to improve our existing processes to 

safeguard	confidential	information	through	periodic	reviews	of	our	Personal	Data	Protection	Policy	and	seeking	ways	to	improve	

staff	training	opportunities.

International Trade Compliance

Compliance with trade compliance laws and regulations is vital to protect the safety and security of countries where we operate 

and to ensure that our products do not fall into the hands of entities and persons that seek to do harm. The nature and scope of 

the Group’s distribution business also make us highly susceptible to being victims of international fraud and unlawful activities, 

especially	where	trade	compliance	is	concerned.	For	this	reason,	the	Group	engages	an	ITC	Officer	to	ensure	the	Group	complies	

with international trade laws and regulations and regularly updates the management and key personnel on developments in 

international and local trade laws and regulations.

The	ITC	officer	leads	the	Group	on	all	ISO	Quality	Accreditations	initiatives.	In	FY2019	and	FY2020,	the	Group’s	various	entities	

obtained	the	following	Trade	&amp;	ISO	Certifications:-

•	Serial	Microelectronics	Pte	Ltd	–	ISO9001:2015	QMS	dated	7	February	2019	and	Re-Certification	on	7	July	2020

			2019	and	Re-Certification	on	2	October	2020

The	following	Trade	&amp;	ISO	Certifications	are	currently	undergoing	re-certification:

• Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd – SG Customs TradeFIRST Premium Band dated 16 March 2018 and currently undergoing 

			re-certification	by	30	June	2021	as	extended	by	Singapore	Customs

			Program	(ICP)	Accreditation	dated	19	March	2018	and	currently	undergoing	re-certification	by	31	August	2021

•	Serial	Microelectronics	Inc.	–	Taiwan	Bureau	of	Foreign	Trade	(BOFT)	Internal	Compliance	Program	(ICP)	Re-Certification	 

			dated	31	March	2020	and	currently	undergoing	re-certification	by	30	November	2021

Owing to Serial Microelectronics Inc.’s strong commitment in trade compliance for strategic high-tech commodities, since 

6	December	2016	(and	re-certified	on	31	March	2020),	we	had	been	accredited	with	Taiwan	Bureau	of	Foreign	Trade	(BOFT)	

Certificate	No.	1052850475	as	the	50th	organization	in	the	entire	Taiwan	and	awarded	the	prestigious	membership	into	BOFT’s	

quarterly	roundtable	meetings	organized	by	the	Ministry	of	Economic	Affairs,	Taiwan.	Re-certification	is	currently	in	progress	and	

is expected to be completed by 30 November 2021.

Similarly, Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd on 16 March 2018 was awarded the Best-In-Class TradeFIRST Accreditation which is valid 

for 3 years and is recognized as a “Secure Trade Partner” with Singapore Customs under the Secure TradeFIRST Partnership (STP) 

Program	and	granted	a	STP	Certification	Membership	No.	AEOSG12022018001T	which	is	mutually	recognized	by	the	World	Customs	

Organization (WCO) matching the standards of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) and U.S. CBP Customs-Trade Partnership 

Against	Terrorism	(C-TPAT).	The	certification	is	extended	until	30	June	2021	by	Singapore	Customs	while	awaiting	re-certification.

From FY2018 to FY2020, Serial Microelectronics Pte Ltd has been listed in the Singapore Customs Website “Hall of Fame” together 

with	105	companies	in	Singapore	as	STP	Companies.	The	STP	is	a	voluntary	certification	programme	consistent	with	the	WCO	SAFE	

Framework of Standards to secure and facilitate global trade. The programme encourages companies to adopt robust security 

measures using a risk-based approach in their trading operations to improve global supply chain security. By participating in the 

programme, a company demonstrates commitment and willingness in keeping the supply chain secure.
