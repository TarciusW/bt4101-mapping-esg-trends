ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2017

On 12 December 2015, the 195 Parties to the UN 

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 

adopted the Paris Agreement at the United Nations (UN) 

Climate Change Conference in Paris.

With the signing of the Paris Agreement, history was 

made as it embodied a successful new approach to 

global cooperation on climate change, with countries 

acknowledging that their national interest is best served 

by acting for the common good by transforming the global 

economy based on low-emission, climate-resilient growth.

EnGro, in its former self, under the auspices of SsangYong 

Cement, began life as a company that ground clinker to 

produce Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in its plant 

located in Singapore.

But in the 1990s, EnGro took a path no others were willing 

to tread on in Singapore, that is, to grind granulated blast-

furnace slag into Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag, 

also known as GGBS, a type of Green Cement, which has 

a carbon footprint that is only 5% of Ordinary Portland 

Cement’s carbon footprint. Back then, blast-furnace 

slag was treated as a waste product dumped in open 

yard landfills whilst still in molten form, an appalling sight 

and an environmental hazard that local municipalities

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2017

around the world faced a challenge to resolve in view of 

the growing steel and iron manufacturing capacities that 

were built globally and, especially so in China over the 

last 20 years.

As China entered the WTO at the turn of the 21st century, 

EnGro shifted its plants to China and concentrated its 

production activities solely on the grinding of granulated 

blast-furnace slag into GGBS powder. As at 2017, EnGro 

established 17 blast-furnace slag grinding plants which 

were set up in collaboration with top steel companies in 

China which benefited from the value-add and efficient 

handling of blast furnace slag, which was once an 

environmental hazard to them. These 17 blast-furnace 

grinding mills in China have a total production capacity 

of 10.2 million tonnes per annum.

The use of GGBS reduces the emissions by 90% as 

compared to use of OPC which emits between 0.8 to 

1.0 tonne of CO2-equivalent. On average, EnGro’s GGBS 

helps the cement industry achieve approximately 6.5 

million tonnes of CO2 emission reduction per annum.

In 2007, EnGro coined the words “BUILDING 

SUSTAINABILITY” to reflect a top-down approach that 

ensures the Group’s business activities would care for the 

environment which it operates and benefits from.

Former United Nations Secretary General Mr Ban 

Kim-Moon once spoke about how “We don’t have Plan B, 

because we don’t have Planet B”. And as there is no 

“Planet B”, EnGro is committed to ensure that EnGro’s 

business activities are in equilibrium with the well-being 

of our only planet Earth.

“BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY” is now the hallmark of 

our corporate philosophy and attitude in addressing 

the needs of preserving the environment, being fair to 

our stakeholders and employees, while striving to meet 

the need for returns by our shareholders alluding to the 

principles of “SUSTAINABLE INVESTING”.

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2017

EnGro Corporation Limited (“EnGro”) is a leading provider of superior building materials, with nearly 45 years of 

operational experience in shaping landscapes in Asia. We started in 1973 in Singapore as a tri-partite joint venture 

company among SsangYong Cement Industrial Co. Ltd. (South Korea), DBS Bank and Afro-Asia Shipping Co. Pte Ltd 

known as SsangYong Cement (Singapore) Pte. Ltd with building materials as its core offering. The Company listed 

on the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) in 1983 and changed its name to EnGro Corporation Limited in 2005 to reflect a 

refreshed focus on growing our business in North Asia and with emphasis on Green. Main businesses include:

VISION AND MISSION

EnGro envisions itself to be the preferred integral partner 

of innovative and sustainable material solutions. In order 

to realize this vision, we strive to be at the forefront 

of product innovations through intensive research and 

development to develop our expertise and insights. Our 

recent innovations have been centralized around green 

and sustainable materials as denoted by our corporate 

tagline “Building Sustainability”. We believe in innovating 

in this field as a new urban lifestyle will be needed in 

our resource-scare future and we are confident that 

eco-friendly products would play a key role in shaping 

the future of construction industry.

To support this vision, EnGro established a mission to 

provide integrated material solutions that are value-

adding, sustainable and cost-effective. We rely on our

ABOUT ENGRO 

CORPORATION



WHAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS TO ENGRO

The global community’s commitment to limit global 

warming to 2oC between now and 2100, requires global 

GHG emissions to decrease by 40% to 70% by 2050 and 

achieve net zero emissions by the end of the century. As 

such, many countries have committed towards reducing 

their GHG footprints. As part of the contribution to 

achieving this goal, the Singapore government has 

pledged to reduce its emissions intensity by 36% 

from 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, in early 2017, 

the Singapore government announced its intention to 

implement the carbon taxation scheme beginning 2019. 

Meanwhile, China has 8 pilot carbon market schemes 

and is expected to start its national carbon market in 

year 2020 to further curb its emissions level on a national 

scale.

These recent developments clearly justify EnGro’s early 

focus and attention into sustainability. The building and 

construction sector is the second largest contributor of 

GHG emissions as building materials generate significant 

amount of embodied GHG emissions throughout their 

product life cycle due to the substantial amount of 

embodied GHG emissions contributed by the use of 

steel and concrete as the core building elements of 

buildings. The building and construction industry is a 

labour-intensive industry while the sector is also one of 

the key GDP contributors to the country. Therefore, one 

of the ways to reduce emissions from the sector while 

maintaining growth of the industry is through the greater 

use of green or sustainable materials.

As we continue to be among the leading suppliers of 

building materials in Singapore and realize our vision 

to be the integral partner of innovative and sustainable 

material solutions, EnGro has the responsibility to promote 

the use of environmentally-friendly materials. In the long 

run, we aim to increase the use of recycled materials in 

our products and commit to doing more research and 

development of innovative sustainable building materials. 

EnGro also continues to provide a safe working environment 

for its employees and  contractors. Safety is paramount in 

EnGro’s operations and we have put in place policies and 

initiatives to ensure minimal injuries occur in our operations. 

On these fronts, we are proud that we have achieved 

internal targets for 2017.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Supply chain forms an important aspect of EnGro’s operations. The company relies on logistics companies to ship raw 

materials from other countries into Singapore. In Singapore, raw materials are received at EnGro’s Pulau Damar Laut 

bulk terminal and blended into our blended cement products. These products are then transported to our concrete 

batching plants to produce Top-Mix concrete or sold to customers directly while a small volume is sold in bagged 

form through distributors.

In our facilities, EnGro primarily utilizes its own employees to run the operations. Logistics service providers are 

employed to transport our products to and from company sites. The latter’s workforce forms around 20% of our 

manpower in Singapore. In order to be selected as EnGro’s service providers or suppliers, potential suppliers must 

adhere to the requirements prescribed in EnGro’s Supplier Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct governs suppliers’ 

compliance to various national rules and regulations including on fair labour practices. Suppliers of EnGro are also 

subjected to regular performance appraisal or supplier assessment to ensure compliance to the Code of Conduct. In 

the future, EnGro is considering to carry out supplier audit as the next step towards ensuring compliance to the Code 

of Conduct.

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2017























In January 2018, EnGro carried out a materiality assessment exercise under the guidance of independent sustainability 

consultants. The assessment involved members of EnGro’s senior management and key representatives from 

operations team, who interacted significantly with external stakeholders. The core group of EnGro’s representatives 

had a discussion to identify sustainability issues relevant to the company from both internal stakeholders’ and external 

stakeholders’ point of views covering ESG aspects. A result of this discussion is a long list of sustainability issues 

relevant to EnGro. The list can be found at the end of this section. Next, the core group voted anonymously on the list 

of sustainability issues to determine issues most material to them and the external stakeholders. After the assessment, 

the EnGro team finalized on 6 sustainability issues as its material issues.

The 6 material issues selected for reporting in this Sustainability Report are:

Customer

MAPPING OF MATERIAL ISSUES TO GRI

Following materiality assessment, the material issues identified was subsequently mapped to the GRI G4 aspects. The 

mapping of the material issues to GRI Aspects are based on the definition of each issue as agreed among EnGro team 

members participating in the materiality assessment.

Following the identification of material issues and mapping to the GRI aspects, EnGro started to put in place processes 

to gather information required by the GRI G4 reporting framework. As this is our first Sustainability Report, we may 

not have a complete set of information required for full disclosure in accordance to the GRI G4 reporting framework. 

Nevertheless, we are committed to providing complete and accurate disclosures and we working towards collecting 

and disclosing more information, including on supply chain partners, in subsequent Sustainability Reports.

GOVERNANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO SUSTAINABILITY

EnGro upholds the highest standard in governance and ethical conduct. We comply with the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 as required by the listing rules of the Singapore Exchange. Please refer to page 23 of the Annual 

Report 2017 for the details of EnGro’s Corporate Governance.

In addition, in light of the SGX listing rule 711(B) on sustainability reporting, EnGro has established a sustainability 

reporting team, which reports directly to the Sustainability Committee. The Sustainability Committee consists of

HIGHLIGHTS

CONSOILDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (S$’000)

Healthy economic or financial performance is paramount 

for EnGro’s foundation to support the company’s efforts 

in other aspects of sustainability. The company recorded 

a profit before tax of SGD 4.2 million in FY2017.

EnGro recorded a revenue of S$141.8 million for the 

year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”), a 7.5 per 

cent decline compared to the S$153.3 million in FY2016, 

due in part to softer demand and intense competition for 

our Integral Cement and Ready-Mix Concrete (“Integral 

Cement &amp; RMC”) in Singapore.

Our Specialty Cement business and China property 

investments performed well but were insufficient to offset 

the lower returns from the Integral Cement &amp; RMC 

business and lower returns from our investment portfolio. 

As a result, the Group’s profit after tax and minority 

interest (PATMI) fell from S$5.8 million in FY2016 to S$3.6 

million in FY2017.

Details of EnGro’s business units’ performance in FY2017

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

The majority of EnGro’s workforce is full-time employees 

under our payroll. We rely on logistics service providers 

to transport our products to and from our facilities, which 

make up approximately 20% of our total workforce in 

Singapore. Ensuring that each employee and worker are 

treated fairly is important to EnGro to promote welfare 

and talent retention.

EnGro is fully compliant with the Singapore government’s 

employee practices listed under the Ministry of Manpower. 

The Human Resources team at EnGro formulated the HR 

Policies and Procedures which are applied to EnGro’s 

business units in Singapore. This ensures consistency 

of internal practices among business units so that 

EnGro can remain competitive by being aligned with 

industry norms. The document communicates grievance 

procedures, dictates employee benefits, reminders on 

work-life balance, and freedom to collective bargaining, 

and governs our hiring and promotion policies, which are 

reliant on merits.

Employees have access to anonymous whistle blowing 

avenues if they find our practices, including remuneration 

to be suspect according to legal and industry standards. 

EnGro’s whistle blowing policy is designed to make 

employees confident in raising concerns to an internal 

authority (Chairman of Audit Committee, CEO and the 

Internal Auditor). Employees can choose to voice their 

grievance to their supervisors or anonymously through 

an electronic mail box of the company. The policy makes 

a commitment to protect the reporter, address issues 

raised and keep the reporter updated on the progress of 

the resolution. The policy is reviewed annually to ensure 

effectiveness and relevance to the changing business 

environment.

As demonstration of our commitment towards providing 

transparent and merit-based compensation package, 

we disclose the remunerations of our directors and our 

top 5 key management personnel in page 44 of our 

Annual Report 2017. In addition, we have also provided 

information on general remunerations for employees at 

each level, further broken down by gender below.

In order to ensure employees and contractors receive 

proper labour and social protection as entitled by the 

law, before confirming employment of individuals, EnGro 

conducts verification of workers’ legal status. The 

company also carries out verification of work pass and 

daily roll-call during Toolbox Meeting to ensure workers 

on site are legally employed by the respective companies, 

including contractors. If there is a breach in contractual 

agreement, EnGro will conduct due investigation of the 

breach and, if found guilty, the work contract could be 

terminated.

Similarly, employees or contractors have the ability to 

air their grievances on unfair labour practices. EnGro 

communicates its grievance procedures policy to its 

employees and contactors. The procedure involves 

reporting to the Supervisor, Department Head, Branch 

Union and Ministry of Manpower. The grievance case will 

be escalated to a higher level if the issue is not resolved 

within 3 working days at each reporting level.

SOCIAL

EnGro places significant emphasis on the health and 

safety of its employees. Management ensures that 

the company complies with legal requirements for all 

safety and health matters and educate our employees 

to observe safety requirements at all times. Since 2012, 

EnGro’s operations in Singapore have obtained OHSAS 

18001 certification for Occupational Health and Safety 

Management Systems.

At EnGro’s production facility, employees attend toolbox 

meeting on a daily basis, where safety advisories and 

reminders are communicated to employees. Before 

commencing any work, supervisors or project managers 

must complete a hazard analysis/risk assessment of 

the work activities and submit to the appropriate EnGro 

management for approval. This requirement is applicable 

to both EnGro’s employees as well as its contractors.

All accidents, would have to go through the process 

of reporting and follow-up until proper closure of each 

accident case. All accident cases have to be reported 

to the supervisors and plant manager and investigations 

are carried out to ensure corrective actions have been 

identified and implemented.

We aim to maintain a “Zero Accident” record at all sites. 

In order to achieve this target, EnGro has taken the 

following initiatives:

1. Employ a full-time Safety Officer to educate and 

identify safety gaps and work towards closing all 

occupational health and safety gaps.

2. Develop standard operation procedure (SOP) manual 

and display the SOP explicitly at all sites with safety 

rules embedded in all the work processes to ensure 

that safety rules are strictly and consistently observed.

3. Organize regular in-house safety training and have 

safety instruction diagrams available visibly near or on 

starting equipment in both English and Mandarin.

4. Provide external safety training to supervisors to 

upgrade their skills and to keep abreast latest safety 

rules and procedures.

EnGro recorded zero case of injuries, lost-time injuries 

and fatality during the reporting year of 2017.

SOCIAL

EnGro upholds a relentless commitment towards 

corporate governance which is in accordance with our 

continuing obligation as a company listed on the SGX. 

We are committed to go beyond the basics in regulatory 

compliance and have established a robust internal 

system, governed by the board and senior management, 

that diligently cross-checks our compliance to regulations 

in various countries we operate in.

EnGro’s goal is to ensure that Management maintains a 

sound system of risk management and internal controls 

to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the company’s 

assets. We have set up a risk assessment structure in the 

form of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee 

comprising of the Heads of Departments. The ERM 

Committee convenes every three (3) months to discuss 

the key risk areas that affects the Group’s business. The 

ERM committee submits its findings to the AC Chairman 

and Board every quarter for review and comments on a 

quarterly basis.

By adhering to laws, regulations, guidelines and 

specifications relevant to EnGro’s businesses, it ensures 

that the Group’s long-standing reputation is intact and 

continues to be preserved. In our view, a strong and 

ethical reputation forms an integral element of our core

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2017

Staying true to our vision, EnGro has run its business 

with responsibility to the environment. We first started 

our green initiatives more than 10 years ago and today 

we are reaping the benefits of these initiatives. In 2010, 

EnGro contributed to the establishment of Friends of 

Building Sustainability, an independent cross-industry 

platform for peers to exchange information on green 

practices. We are also an ISO14001 certified company. 

EnGro and its subsidiary company have invariably sought 

to obtain international certifications, such as the ISO, 

to demonstrate our environmental commitment. The 

company has been certified ISO14001 since 2012 and we 

are in the process of renewing our certification this year.

The company has carried out various carbon footprint 

assessments to understand the GHG contribution of 

our operations and products. In 2011, EnGro engaged 

the services of a professional GHG assessor to analyze 

the product life cycle assessment of its products in 

accordance to international standards ISO14040/44 and 

PAS2050. In 2012, we became one of the early adopters 

of the ISO14064 to assess the GHG emissions relating 

to organizational emissions. EnGro is also proud to 

have achieved carbon neutrality for China joint venture 

laboratory building project in 2013 as per PAS2060 

certification by offsetting our FY2010 emissions.

These assessments have enabled EnGro to better 

understand the true emission sources of our products 

and our operations, which have helped us to manage our 

resources more efficiently. The management truly believes 

in the benefits of monitoring EnGro’s GHG footprint and 

continues to assess its emissions.

USE OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS

All of EnGro’s products utilize recycled materials as raw 

materials. Moreover, EnGro cement and Top-Mix Concrete 

use EnGro’s low-carbon VCEM GGBS to their mixtures. 

This results in products of lower carbon-content than typical 

Ordinary Portland Cement, while maintaining the strength 

and functionality of the products. Since 2007, our products 

have received accreditation from the Singapore Green 

Labelling Scheme for its sustainability qualities. In addition, 

since 2011, our products have also been acknowledged to 

have met the highest industry standards for a green product. 

Our products have received “4 ticks” or “Leader” rating from 

the Singapore Green Building Product (SGBP) accreditation 

body. This rating is given to eco-friendly products with 

low-carbon content.
