Sustainability is the crux of the success of 

any enterprise, especially enterprises with the 

conviction to achieve triple bottomline, namely 

‘People, Planet, Profit’, for the benefits of both 

private  enterprise and society. 

At Sinwa Limited, we are committed to uphold 

the highest standards of Environment, Social 

and Governance (ESG) practices within our 

organisation.  While we are taking our first steps 

in the sustainability journey, we have embraced 

our corporate social responsibility with conviction 

and fervour.

We believe our sustainable growth and success 

is only possible with the sustainable development 

of the communities we operate in, be it social, 

business or national communities.

Driving long term sustainability is our vision. 

Centred on our key material issues, we have 

charted 

a 

four-pronged 

approach 

to 

our 

sustainable development roadmap. We will 

endeavour to set ourselves on the journey of 

achieving a good balance between financial 

growth and ESG performance.

Corporate social responsibility is in the DNA 

of our organisation. As a market leader in the 

marine, offshore supply and logistics industry, 

we demonstrate our commitment through the 

adoption of responsible business practices. 

The Group is committed to complying with all 

applicable laws and regulations in the markets 

we operate in. The Board expects all Group’s 

employees to be vigilant to maintain the corporate 

values and high quality of the Group’s products 

and services.

Over the years, we have taken the lead to actively 

support community and education programmes 

such as BizLink since 2011.

Moving forward, we believe that investment 

in human capital is the key to the long term 

sustainable success of Sinwa Group. Therefore, 

we are committed to invest in strengthening our 

staff training and development roadmap, as well 

as enhancing the environmental sustainability of 

our operations.

to our stakeholders, our strategy in managing these challenges and issues, and how we have performed

With our vision and corporate values in mind, we 

aim to integrate sustainability into the businesses 

of Sinwa so that it is systematic and seamless. 

Where possible, we incorporate sustainability 

considerations in our decision-making processes.

Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior 

management who ensures that the Company’s 

business objectives are in line with our 

commitments 

to 

sustainable 

development. 

Senior management is responsible for on-going 

communication to the Board of Directors.

Sinwa’s senior management has determined 

focus areas where Sinwa can have the greatest 

economic, environmental and social impact, as 

well as the areas that are most important to our 

stakeholders.

Sinwa has taken efforts to seek the opinion of 

internal and external stakeholders formally and 

informally. We aspire to understand the needs 

and expectations of our key stakeholders and 

strive to build mutually beneficial relationships.

COMPANY

MOTTO

Reliability is 

our business

ECONOMIC


At present, we operate in more than 100 ports 

in 11 locations in Australia, China, Thailand 

and Singapore. Each port is operated by one 

of our teams of professional operations staff 

and overseen by Sinwa Corporate Office. We 

manage our operations in accordance to our 

sustainability principles. We work closely with our 

business partners and operation staff to identify 

and consider any sustainability opportunities and 

risks that may arise.

Sustainability trends such as climate change, 

resource scarcity and demographic changes 

shape the competitive environment in which 

companies like Sinwa operate by introducing long 

term sustainability opportunities and recognising 

risks. We therefore view our business performance 

beyond short term gains and financial bottomline. 

Our conviction is to achieve a balanced triple 

bottomline (People, Planet, Profit) for sustained 

growth for the organisation and the communities 

we operate in.

The success of our business is highly dependent 

on the commitment of our management and staff. 

Their knowledge, professional expertise and 

their job satisfaction are key to our economic 

sustainability.

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively 

to the society through our economic presence 

by serving as Asia Pacific’s leading marine, 

offshore supply and logistics company servicing 

the marine and offshore industry in Singapore, 

China, Thailand and Australia, while maintaining 

good stewardship of the resources we manage 

and generating good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost leadership 

without compromising our service level and 

highest priority on customer’s interest. We seek 

organic growth from the existing outlets as well 

as through the acquisition of new businesses that 

reap good returns.

We strive to maintain our market position by 

ensuring we gain the trust of our customers and 

their families, and continually build our reputation 

and brand name in marine, offshore supply and 

logistics industry in Asia Pacific.

In today’s highly volatile business environment, 

Sinwa has, beyond sustained earnings, diligently 

embraced 

prudent 

financial 

management, 

capitalised on our assets and investments, 

and remained focused on growth strategies, to 

enhance shareholders’ value.

LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Corporate governance and compliance have 

always been one of the top priorities for the 

Company.

The decision-making process in the Company 

is strictly in line with legal and regulatory 

requirements and in compliance with the Code 

of Corporate Governance issued by Monetary 

Authority of Singapore and the Companies 

Act (Chapter 50) of Singapore issued by the 

Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority 

(ACRA).

The 

Company 

has 

not 

received 

any 

correspondences or notifications in relation to 

any non-compliance of legal and regulatory 

requirements 

or 

the 

Code 

of 

Corporate 

Governance from any government and regulatory 

agencies in FY2017. The Audit Committee 

received no whistle-blowing letters during the 

year.

ETHICS &amp; INTEGRITY

We promote an ethical and act with integrity 

culture throughout the Company. We seek to 

conduct our business in an ethical manner and 

in compliance with the best practices in the 

marine, offshore supply and logistics industry. 

All Directors, operations and management staff 

are required to fully comply with our principles 

set in our Employee Handbook and employment 

contract.

The Employee Handbook details our expected 

standards of employee’s professional behaviour 

towards our business partners whom we have 

business dealings with, to the people in the society 

whom we serve as customers and towards each 

other as employees of the Company. Above all, 

we are inculcated with strong corporate values to 

act with integrity.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND  

ANTI-FRAUD

With zero-tolerance policy to bribery and 

corruption, we have put in place effective 

monitoring and management control systems 

to detect bribery, fraud or other malpractice 

activities directly at the source. We have 

established a whistle-blowing mechanism for 

employees and any other concerned stakeholders 

such as customers and their families, suppliers, 

competitors and contractors.

A direct whistle-blowing channel has also been 

implemented to enable our employees to get 

direct access to our Chief Executive Officer. By 

doing so, our stakeholders can be assured that 

all reports or suspicions of potential breaches of 

our Employee guidelines are taken seriously by 

the Group. Our external stakeholders can reach 

our Executive Director, Ms Tan Lay Ling, via 

telephone or email.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND 

REGULATIONS

The Group is proactive in ensuring its compliance 

with all relevant laws and regulations. Our 

management team is responsible to review and 

monitor the Group’s policies and practices in 

respect to legal and regulatory requirements 

across all operations. Any non-compliance of the 

relevant laws and regulations and the proposed 

resolutions will be reported to the Board of 

Directors on a quarterly basis.

The Group has put in place policies and 

procedures to ensure compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations, particularly those 

relating to Maritime Port of Authority of Singapore 

(MPA). At the corporate level, we also ensure that 

we are in compliance, both in substance and in 

spirit, with the Listing Rules of SGX-ST, Securities 

and Futures Act and Singapore Companies Act.

Any new enactment of or changes to the relevant 

laws and regulations will be communicated to all 

operations and management staff via emails and 

small group meetings. Such communication is 

necessary to ensure that all staff are aware of the 

changes and can carry out the necessary steps 

SINWA LIMITED    Sustainability Report

and actions to ensure compliance.

While we seek to leverage our data to serve our 

customers responsibly, we adhere and uphold 

the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). 

We have put in place policies to ensure we are 

in compliance with PDPA and we respect our 

customers’ choices in respect of their personal 

data and the protection of our customers’ privacy.

There is no incidence of product and service 

misinformation 

and 

labelling 

or 

marketing 

communications reported.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group recognises the importance of risk 

management and how business risks may 

adversely affect Sinwa’s business performance.

While it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, 

as delegated by the Board of Directors, to  

oversee the effectiveness of our risk management 

and internal controls, the core function of the 

internal audit is coordinated by our Chief Financial 

Officer who reports to the Audit Committee on a 

regular basis.

SUPPLY CHAIN &amp; PROCUREMENT 

PRACTICES

Our supply chain constitutes mainly the suppliers 

for our marine, offshore supply and logistics 

businesses for all our 100 port operations. We 

have maintained a strong partnership with the 

suppliers for our marine, offshore supply and 

logistics businesses.

We believe in transparency in our supply chain 

and our approach is to positively engage with 

suppliers if we identify any issues. Any non-

compliance with the guidelines of local and 

international regulatory bodies will result in 

us in not embarking on or discontinuing the 

procurement and business relationship with 

them.

SERVICE QUALITY AND 

RESPONSIBILITY

For a marine, offshore supply and logistics 

service provider like Sinwa, our service quality 

and responsibility to our customers ranks high for 

the sustainable success of the Company. We are 

committed to provide reliable and high quality 

marine, offshore supply and logistics products 

to our customers and every vessel we service. 

We emphasise on service excellence to every 

customer.

Our operations and professional staff serve our 

customers professionally and ethically.

We believe our business has low impact on the 

environment. Nevertheless, we strive to embrace 

environmental 

sustainability 

by 

managing 

environmental conservation through adopting 

‘Reduce’, ‘Re-use’, ‘Recycle’ and energy efficient 

practices.

WATER AND ENERGY 

CONSERVATION

In Singapore, we tap on the water supply provided

PAPER USAGE

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives 

across all our operations and Corporate Office. 

The implemented initiatives aim to encourage the 

“Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” of papers through 

the following ways:    

• ‘Reduce’ the use of papers by sending the 

printers to print on double-sides of each piece 

of paper and print only when necessary. 

• ‘Re-use’ single-side printed papers for non-

confidential and draft documents. We plan 

to roll out the daily operations reports to be 

electronic and paperless.

 

We are looking into recycling all used papers, 

printed materials and collaterals by donating to 

authorised recycling companies.

Our business is highly dependent on senior

HIGH TALENT RETENTION RATE

We are continuously recruiting talents, particularly

Our recruitment policy is based on meritocracy 

and the pre-requisite skills and academic 

qualifications required to perform the required job 

scope. During recruitment, we have implemented 

stringent shortlisting process to ensure we recruit 

people with the same values as we do.

We focus on retention of talents by providing 

fair and sustainable financial and non-financial 

incentives, and learning and development 

opportunities. Our compensation and benefits 

policies (including parental leave) are determined 

by guidelines proposed by our Human Resource 

and approved by the Remuneration Committee 

of our Board. All our staff undergo annual 

performance reviews and receive periodic 

performance feedbacks from their superiors.

We practise equal opportunities for skills training 

and career development for all staff and this has

contributed to our high retention rate of 91% in 

2017. We rely on our team of full-time employees 

to deliver our service to our customers.

The management team provides clear direction 

within the organisation on the value of an effective 

occupational health and safety management 

approach to foster risk-free and environmentally-

environmental awareness and green practices to 

lead the group in adhering to all WSH regulations 

as stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower 

(“MOM”), Maritime Port of Authority of Singapore 

(“MPA”) and all the port authorities of the national 

jurisdictions we operate in.

Our operations are closely monitored and 

reviewed by our appointed safety officers, who 

ensure all employees comply to the codes of 

practice and safety procedures they have set out. 

Our emphasis on promoting workers’ health and 

improving occupational safety has resulted in low 

numbers of accidents in our workplace and we 

will continue to uphold our mandate to target zero 

injuries and fatalities amongst our workforce.

LABOUR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

It is important to have effective communication 

between management and employees, so 

that employees are more engaged with the 

organisation, and have a more positive attitude 

towards their work and loyalty to Sinwa Group. 

They are provided with frequent management 

updates and adequate notice period regarding 

operational changes.

We often engage our employees in the following 

ways: Weekly Meetings Port Managers have 

weekly meetings with the management team to 

discuss about operations review.

•  Quarterly Meetings

conducts 

quarterly 

meetings 

for Board of Directors to discuss on business 

development and finance.

•  Informal Small Group Meetings 

Meetings are often held by management to listen 

and understand our employees’ concerns and 

grievances.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY &amp;

warrants high level of security and confidentiality 

of our clients’ personal data as well as the 

business transactions they have undertaken.

We adhere strictly to the guidelines set by the 

Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). We have 

invested to ensure our proprietary IT system 

meets the highest standards for IT security.

There is no complaints concerning breaches of 

customer privacy and losses of customer data.

CORPORATE SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY

Being a responsible corporate citizen, we believe 

in giving back to the society. While we strive to 

achieve our business goals, we also believe in 

playing our part in serving our local community.

Centre, a Non-Profit Organisation that provides 

employment services for disadvantaged people.

of 

Community 

Development 

and

employment aid programmes. We assent to their 

mission statement, “To reach out to people with 

disabilities in Singapore and to assist them in 

achieving independence, dignity and integration 

into mainstream society through open and 

sheltered employment” and are proud to be 

associated with their quest. Sinwa will continue to
