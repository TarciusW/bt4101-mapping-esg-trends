Dear Shareholders, 

 

On behalf of the Directors and Management of HC Surgical Specialists Limited (“HCSS”), I am 

delighted to present our inaugural Sustainability Report for HCSS for the financial year ended 31 May 

2018 (“FY2018”). In this report, we discuss material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

topics that matter most to our business and to both our internal and external stakeholders, our strategy 

in managing these topics, and how we have performed in terms of our key performance indicators.  

 

To expand our presence into the heartland areas of Singapore as well as to develop and grow the 

range of medical services we provide, HCSS announced a few acquisitions / collaboration in FY2018: 

(i) MediNex Pte. Ltd. ("MediNex") and Nex Healthcare Pte. Ltd. ("Nex"); (ii) Medical L &amp; C 

Services Pte. Ltd.; (iii) HMC Medical Pte. Ltd.; and (iv) HC and Island Family Pte. Ltd.. These will 

also help to create a conducive platform of patient referrals for our specialists. We aim to constantly 

deliver safe, accurate and efficient services to our patients. 

 

We recognise that our operations and sustainability efforts have both direct and indirect impact on our 

internal and external stakeholders. In our commitment to sustainability, we strive to drive our 

operations in the direction in which we can contribute positively to all of our stakeholders. 

 

Our Board recognises the importance of sustainability in our Group’s business operations and 

performance and oversees the overall strategic plan including considering sustainability and 

environmental issues as part of our strategic formulation. Our sustainability efforts are led by senior 

management and our Board oversees and manages the direction, approach and performance of our 

sustainability goals against our strategy and business objectives. Our Board concurs with the material 

ESG factors identified by senior management and has overseen the management and monitoring of 

the material ESG factors.

ABOUT OUR GROUP  

 

Our Supply Chain 

 

We aim to build a responsible and sustainable supply chain by extending the application of 

responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We are still at the beginning of our 

journey to integrate sustainable business practices throughout our supply chain, and we are committed 

to continuous improvement.  

 

Drugs/medicines and medical equipment are the key purchases of our Group. Our key suppliers are 

carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When selecting our key suppliers, we 

examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services, and market reputation. In 

addition, we also take into consideration sustainability efforts undertaken by our suppliers in areas 

such as ethical conduct, effective quality, health and workplace safety system and environmental 

management.   

 

In FY2018, our Group invested in local management and service providers in the medical clinics 

industry as part of our supply chain integration strategies, they are:  

a) 

MediNex and Nex, both management and service providers in the medical clinics industry, 

provides medical support services such as training, setting up medical clinics, demographic 

survey, data analytics, medical IT advice, pharmaceutical business, accounting and taxation 

services; and 

b) 

Medical L &amp; C Services Pte. Ltd., a company which provides chronic home care and palliative 

care; HMC Medical Pte. Ltd. with a GP clinic at Upper Thomson; and collaboration with Island 

Medical Holdings Pte. Ltd., a GP group with 6 clinics across Singapore.  

These will help to create a conducive platform of patient referrals for our specialists. The investment 

expanded our value chain to include medical services, supplies distribution and achieved our goal to 

expand our presence into the heartland areas of Singapore. We continuously evaluate and refine our 

supply chain strategy to keep pace with the evolution of the marketplace. We aim to remain as a 

leader and a trusted partner in healthcare by addressing the changing needs of our patients, consumers 

and customers – whoever they are and wherever they may be.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

In the financial year (“FY”) ended 31 

May 2018 (“FY2018”), our Group is 

pleased to announce that we achieved a 

total 

revenue 

of 

approximately 

S$16.02 million, a substantial 69% 

increase compared to the FY ended 31 

May 2017 (“FY2017”). The net profit 

after income tax for FY2018 increased 

by S$4.25 million or 336%, amounting 

to approximately S$5.51 million.  

 

The new subsidiaries we acquired in 

both FY2017 and FY2018 have 

contributed to the Group’s revenue and 

have positively impacted the Group’s 

financial 

position. 

The 

acquisitions/collaboration played an 

important role in expanding not only 

our surgical facilities but also our 

specialists support platform.  

 

For detailed breakdown of FY2018 financial results and more in-depth discussion of our business 

acquisitions, please refer to the relevant sections in our published annual report 2018. 

 

At HCSS, we believe in creating long-term economic value for all our shareholders and key 

stakeholders by adopting responsible business practices and growing our business in a sustainable 

manner.  

Our Group will continue its endeavor to expand the business operations by acquiring GPs, in order to 

secure a consistent stream of patients through the GP referrals, as well as grooming young talented 

specialists and acquiring/setting up new clinics to broaden our range of services. We aim to further 

expand our presence in the heartland areas of Singapore, enhancing our ability to constantly deliver 

timely, safe, accurate and efficient services to outpatients.

SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

 

The corporate culture of protecting the environment is reflected in every operation undertaken by our 

Group. Effluents and waste is categorised mainly into 2 categories: sharps and liquid bio-waste. They 

are usually discarded into designated waste bins according to categories and transported by certified 

third party contractors to dedicated hospital waste incinerator.  

 

Proper waste management, especially clinical 

waste, is important to HCSS as a healthcare 

service provider.  

 

HCSS recognises the importance of handling 

the effluents and waste properly and in 

accordance with regulations, so as to prevent 

negative impact to the environment and the 

community.  

 

For clinics located in hospitals, liquid bio-waste and used sharps e.g. needles, intravenous sets, are 

discarded into hospital-designated waste bins for proper disposal by hospitals. Clinics in the 

heartlands will bring the sharp containers to hospitals to dispose and engage certified third-party 

contractors to dispose liquid bio-waste, who will send them to dedicated hospital waste incinerator. 

 

In FY2018, HCSS generated about 1,700 litres of clinical waste, all of which were incinerated by 

certified third-party contractors or hospitals. There were no confirmed incidents of non-compliance to 

environmental regulations resulting in a fine or penalty occurred during FY2018.  

 

The Group endeavors to maintain no confirmed incidents of non-compliance to environmental 

regulations which will result in a fine or penalty for FY2019.

SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 

 

CUSTOMER PRIVACY 

 

We understand that with the advancement of technology, there is a growing trend of concerns for 

individuals on how their personal data are being collected and used. 

 

Personal Data Protection Act 

 

With the establishment of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) in 2012, personal data is 

protected in Singapore by various rules governing the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal 

data. Protection of the personal data of our stakeholders, including but not limited to, customers and 

employees are vital to our ability to conduct operations.  

 

We have in place a Personal Data Protection Policy (“PDPP”) which includes procedures on 

responsible data handling, use of data and compliance monitoring. The PDPP protects the personal 

data while enabling organisations to use the customer’s data reasonably when serving the customer. 

HCSS as a healthcare company, collect relevant data and use them for the following purposes: 

i. 

Providing medical services for treatment; 

ii. 

Communication with Doctors, Appointed Third-Party Personnel who are involved in 

customer care; 

iii. 

Communication with Insurance Companies and Third-Party Administrators for customer 

treatments; 

iv. 

Communication with Government Bodies, for example, Medisave Board, National Electronic 

Health Records on customer visits; 

v. 

Facilitate payment on products and services including verification of credit card payments; 

and 

vi. 

Disclosure to any third-party, with compliance to legal requirements, orders, directions or 

request from any court, authority or government bodies within or outside Singapore. 

Each centre in the Group will take reasonable efforts to protect personal data in our possession by 

making reasonable security arrangements such as locking cabinets that store patients data, setting up 

user IDs and passwords for each staff in the clinic system, logging off the computers daily, and 

installing firewalls and antivirus on all computers. This helps to prevent unauthorised access, 

collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. 

 

Here at HCSS, we are very proud to report that we have not received any substantiated complaints or 

had any breaches or loss of any customer data. Our customers’ privacy is of utmost importance to our 

Group and we consistently monitor and update our PDPP in accordance with new requirements and 

business developments. We target to continue achieving zero complaints and breaches to the PDPA. 

The PDPP is available on our Company’s website at https://www.hcsurgicalspecialists.com.
