BoARD stAteMent

Singapore Kitchen Equipment Limited 

(hereafter referred to as “SKE” or the 

“Group” or the “Company”) would like 

to present the annual Sustainability 

Report (the “Report”) which covers 

our Group’s performance from 1 

January 2020 to 31 December 2020 

(the “Reporting Period”).

This Report covers the Group’s 

key 

sustainability 

issues, 

the 

management’s approach and related 

performance, and is prepared in 

accordance with the GRI standards: 

Core Option.

Certain disclosures in the Report will 

be disclosed in the Annual Report 

2020, which has been delayed due to 

additional audit procedures.

For the Sustainability Report in 

FY2020, our Board of Directors 

continued to appoint a steering 

committee 

spearheaded 

by 

Ms 

Charlene 

Koh 

and 

a 

working 

committee comprising senior staff at 

our Singapore Headquarters and our 

subsidiary in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

During this Reporting Period, the 

Board members remained the same. 

The Board takes yearly sustainability 

reporting seriously, and all concerns 

of the stakeholders are duly discussed 

which have been implemented in our 

business strategies to enhance our 

quality and capabilities.

However, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus 

(“COVID-19”) outbreak in FY2020 

seized countries across the globe, 

posing unprecedented challenges to 

economies worldwide. Our operations 

in Singapore and Malaysia had also 

been greatly affected. With the Circuit 

Breaker measures (“CB Measures”) 

in Singapore during April to June, 

and the Movement Control Order 

(“MCO”) in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, 

between March to December, our 

production operations came to a halt 

due to a huge drop in project orders 

for stainless steel products. Our 

factories were shuttered, keeping 

only a few bare minimum production 

staff. As such, both qualitative and 

quantitative data collected for this 

Report would present a one-off 

scenario that is very different from 

that of past years. 







“ 

”

We will continue our core sustainable strategies: Stay CuStOMER CEntRIC to 

enhance greater local business support, SEEK anD KEEP tHE BESt talEntS in 

the field to consolidate our human capital, GO DIGItal for innovative and smart 

kitchen solutions, BunDlE PROJECtS WItH SERVICE SuPPORt to serve our 

customers better and VEntuRE IntO nEW MaRKEtS and new areas of growth.

Through 

the 

experience 

of 

the 

events in FY2020, we are, now more 

than ever, aware of the importance 

of sustainability in every aspect 

to ensure business continuity and 

the ripple effect our decisions and 

actions can cause. Looking ahead, 

we will continue our core sustainable 

strategies: 

Stay 

customer-centric 

to enhance greater local business 

support, seek and keep the best 

talents in the field to consolidate our 

human capital, go digital for innovative 

and smart kitchen solutions, bundle 

projects  with  service support to 

serve our customers better and 

venture into new markets and new 

areas of growth.

Last but not least, the Board would like 

to thank all parties who participated 

in the compilation of this Report and 

welcome our stakeholders’ feedback 

to us pertaining to our Sustainability 

Report. Please feel free to send your 

comments and suggestions to Ms 

Charlene Koh at charlene@qson.

electricity and Water Conservation

We have guidelines in place to ensure efficient use of electricity by installing power-saving Light-Emitting Diode 

(LED) lights at our factories and offices. Employees will consciously turn off all power switches not in use during 

lunch and tea breaks. Air-conditioning temperature is also maintained at 24 degrees Celsius at all times. These 

measures help to control the wastage of energy when it is not in use. As a result of the CB Measures as well as 

MCO, production capacity was greatly reduced, thus we record a sharp drop in the usage of water and electricity 

for the year.

as follows:



A set of safety rules and regulations is in place;



Safety committee is established and safety inspections are performed regularly;



Briefings and talks on occupational safety are organised regularly; and

our Labour Force 

(Malaysia Plant)

Our kitchen equipment products 

are 

mostly 

manufactured 

in 

Johor Bahru (Plentong), Malaysia, 

a 

30-minute 

drive 

from 

the 

Singapore 

Causeway. 

Our 

approximately 25,000 sq ft factory 

has laser bending machines, CNC 

machines, milling machines and 

related 

automated 

production 

equipment. Headed by a factory 

manager, 4 supervisors and 57 

foreign production workers from 

8 countries, the daily operation 

in two shifts include the planning, 

fabricating, welding and polishing 

processes. The Japanese Kaisen 

management system is practised 

at our factory. Every completed 

part is documented and placed 

orderly at the designated locations 

for the next production process. 

Finished products are packed and 

transported by trucks and lorries 

to the Singapore warehouse on a 

twice-weekly basis.

Not all our workers have a technical 

background. All unskilled workers 

will be trained and coached by a 

senior technician before working 

on a particular job independently. 

Every worker is required to go 

for 4 hours’ training monthly on 

their 

job-related 

courses. 

80% 

of them are below the age of 40. 

They 

speak 

English, 

Mandarin 

and Malay. The factory manager 

organises activities monthly to 

build cohesiveness and team spirit. 

The morale of the workers at the 

plant is high.

Based on orders and designs 

from Singapore HQ, the factory 

runs independently with excellent 

cost control measures. Due to 

Malaysian tariff increase on the 

imported steel sheets from China, 

the key material procurement has 

been directed to Malaysian local 

suppliers.

eMPLoYees’ entRY WAGes

We adhere to the wage laws 

of Singapore and Malaysia. In 

Singapore, the entry wages are 

S$2,200 for local and S$1,100 

for foreign workers. In Malaysia, 

the entry wages are Malaysian 

RM1,500 for local and RM1,100 

for foreign workers. On average, 

we 

paid 

higher 

entry 

wages 

than the required minimum to 

attract and retain employees. Our 

turnover was low in the past and 

the replacement is fast. We strictly 

abide by the manpower laws and 

regulations. All new employees will 

receive their lawful benefits upon 

meeting the national labour law 

requirements.

DIVeRsItY In tHe 

WoRKFoRCe

We 

embrace 

diversity 

and 

have employees from different 

backgrounds and is not gender or 

age biased. We have representation 

from 

different 

nationalities 

in 

Singapore and Malaysia. Besides 

Singaporeans 

and 

Malaysians, 

there are 5 other nationalities in 

our Group including Vietnamese, 

Chinese, 

Bangladeshi, 

Filipinos 

and Burmese. The most common 

languages 

used 

are 

Chinese, 

English and Malay. This diversity 

in 

the 

workforce 

allows 

our 

organisation to be more vibrant 

and innovative with each employee 

offering different experiences and

eDUCAtIon

We believe that our greatest assets 

are our people and that the skill 

sets and knowledge of our staff is 

the crux of our success. Therefore, 

we invest in trainings, learning 

initiatives and development to 

expand our staff competencies. On 

average, our workers received 20 

hours of training a year depending 

on their job requirements. In the 

coming years, we plan to increase 

average training hours gradually 

based on the recommendations of 

each department’s needs.

In FY2020, as staff were mandated 

to WFH or telecommute under 

the CB Measures, we took this 

opportunity to let them undergo 

training seminars to upskill their 

capabilities 

and 

prepare 

them 

for the job and orders that will 

come in with the ceasing of the CB 

Measures and MCO. During the 

period of March to August 2020, 

about 80% of our staff underwent 

relevant 

and 

related 

courses, 

especially 

for 

service 

training. 

Through video-conference training 

sessions, the technical team was 

able to be “factory-trained” virtually 

by manufacturers and principals 

from our overseas suppliers. It was 

an effective and cost-containing 

way to train our team. 

eMPLoYees’ BeneFIts

We have in place programmes 

to encourage healthy workforce 

through sports, social and health 

education 

talks 

and 

activities. 

Our employees’ welfare benefits 

include 

fully-paid 

outpatient 

medical treatments, hospitalisation 

and insurance coverage, workmen 

compensation insurance as well as 

medical and hospitalisation leave. 

Our Group supports government 

pro-family policies and follows 

statutory 

regulations 

in 

both 

Singapore 

and 

Malaysia 

with 

regards to parental and childcare 

leave.

Neither at the end of nor at any 

time during the financial year 

was the Company a party to any 

arrangement 

whose 

object 

is 

to enable the Directors of the 

Company to acquire benefits by 

means of the acquisition of shares 

in, or debentures of, the Company 

or any other body corporate.

However, due to COVID-19 and 

its impacts on the economy and 

our business, we were forced to 

execute a pay cut exercise between 

the months of March to December 

2020 to mitigate the drastic fall in 

revenue during the worst of the 

pandemic. 

CoRPoRAte soCIAL 

ResPonsIBILItY (“CsR”)

Our Group strives to take the 

lead as a good example in being 

good and responsible corporate 

social citizens. We encourage our 

employees to give back to the 

society through community service 

projects and/or donations to the 

less fortunate.

With 

the 

pandemic 

rampant 

globally and travel bans in FY2020, 

we could not carry on with our 

CSR efforts overseas for volunteer 

work to build homes, schools, 

and 

community 

wells 

in 

the 

undeveloped countries. 

Instead, we ramped up our CSR 

initiatives in the local community, 

having volunteer staff scheduled 

to deliver packed food from the 

local soup kitchens to the low-

income residences of different 

constituencies. 

SKE also provides bursaries to 

needy students through various 

partner universities without bond 

each year. We believe in education 

for the locals to ensure a brighter 

tomorrow for themselves and their 

next generation. In the year, we 

gave out tertiary education bursary 

sponsorships 

to 

5 

deserving 

students of the Singapore Institute 

of Technology who were in need.

Corporate Governance

A high standard of corporate governance is integral in 

ensuring sustainability of the Group’s business as well 

as safeguarding shareholders’ interests and maximising 

long-term value. Our overall Singapore Governance

National University of Singapore Business School was 

75 for FY2020, an improvement from 68 for FY2019.

Whistle-Blowing and Anti-Corruption 

Policy

The Group has in place a Whistle-Blowing Policy that 

provides a channel to employees and other parties to 

report in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns 

about possible improprieties in financial reporting or 

other matters. Our stakeholders and public can contact 

us at a dedicated line 64723049 or email to whistle@

Risk Management

The Group outsourced its internal audit functions to a 

well-established, mid-tier local accounting firm. On an 

annual basis, the internal auditors prepare the internal 

audit plan for the Audit Committee’s (the “AC”) approval. 

These audits are conducted to assess the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 

and the internal control systems, including financial, 

operational, compliance and information technology 

controls. Concerted efforts were made to rectify lapses 

and non-compliance issues reported by the internal 

auditors.

We have engaged TRS Forensics Pte Ltd as our internal 

auditor. The AC will review the findings of the internal 

auditor and will ensure that the Group follows up on 

the internal auditor’s recommendations raised during 

the audit process.

On 15 September 2020, following an investigation by 

the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) on 

certain transactions, the Group engaged the internal 

auditor to conduct an independent review on the risk 

management and internal controls surrounding the 

transactions under investigation by CPIB. The AC will 

review the findings highlighted by the internal auditor 

from the internal audit and independent review 

conducted and will take necessary steps to ensure 

that the Group follows up on the internal auditor’s 

recommendations to address any internal control 

gaps. Concerted efforts will be made by the Group to 

rectify any lapse and non-compliance reported by the 

internal auditor.

On 22 March 2021, the Company announced that the AC 

has after the announcement of the FY2020 unaudited 

financial results engaged in further discussions with 

its statutory auditors, BDO LLP, and after further 

discussions, requested that additional review and 

verification be carried out. The AC will review the 

outcome of the additional review and take such steps 

that may be required including making the requisite 

announcements.

• Welding 

jobs, 

which 

constitutes 

a 

vast majority of our new equipment 

fabrication and servicing jobs in the 

market, can be tedious, hazardous and 

has restrictive outputs.

• There is an available automatic laser 

machine in the market. It is a state-of-the 

art equipment that is highly efficient but 

cost is prohibitive. We are planning to tap 

on government funding to purchase these 

efficient tools. The funding programme was 

set to take place in 1Q 2020, but all plans had 

been disrupted by the onset of COVID-19. 

We are looking into restarting these plans as 

soon as operationally possible. 

social (talents)

• With the growth of the company and the 

rising number of projects, experienced 

project or site supervisors are much 

needed. Currently, project supervisors 

are handling 7 to 8 projects at the same 

time as compared to the normal capacity 

of 5 to 6 projects.

• We tap on the current pool of technicians 

to become project coordinators. The HR 

department actively seeks to fill both 

positions and continual training is given. 

Technicians are easier to recruit than project 

coordinators.

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial 

Officer (“CFO”) will provide a letter of assurance for the 

financial year to confirm that the financial records have 

been properly maintained and the financial statements 

give a true and fair view of the Company’s operations 

and finances. The CEO and key management personnel 

or Executive Director, Mr Lee Chong Hoe will also provide 

a letter of assurance for the financial year to confirm 

the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s risk 

management and internal control systems.

For FY2020, the CB Measures as well as MCO had caused our sales and production to be pretty much flat through 

the year. However, the issues we face are often recurring, thus the policies, measures and targets that we set are 

also repetitive in helping us tackle the various issues to ensure sustainability in our business. 

Investor Relations

support the sustainability of our business. Investors

• Referrals or recommendations from staff 

are highly encouraged and incentivised. For 

each successful referral having worked for 1 

year, the company will pay a referral fee of 

S$1,000 to the referrer.

• Sales persons are difficult to recruit 

from the open market and new sales 

personnel will take time to acquire the 

necessary skills even when trainings 

are provided. With the drop in our sales 

and revenue for FY2020, the need for 

experienced sales persons will be of 

increased importance to bring in higher 

sales. 

• The HR department will source for talents 

from the related industries by offering 

better incentives and better promotion 

opportunities to persons with track records.

• Market will remain highly competitive as 

the F&amp;B and hospitality industries are 

expected to take a downturn. Margins 

may be compromised, and higher 

volume sales will be required to meet 

the bottom line.

• Some or many suppliers, vendors and 

manufacturers may or will be re-sourced for 

better cost management.

social

(supply Chain)

• Due to new import duty on steel 

products from China, our alternative 

cheaper source of supply has been 

disrupted. Currently, our supply is from 

local milling contractors. Moreover, with 

COVID-19, production and shipment has 

been affected. 

• Two measures will be taken to stabilise the 

supply chain and control cost

 - To look out for additional suppliers to 

ensure quality suppliers and fair prices

 - To check with authorities for relevant 

incentives and re-export of finished goods.

• Target – The purchasing team will source 

for at least three suppliers for the affected 

materials

Within the Group, we will track our progress on these material factors by systematically identifying relevant 

information and data, while conducting Gap Analysis to ensure the expectations of our stakeholders match the 

Company’s. In addition, we will set performance targets to align our strategies, ensuring that we maintain the right 

course in our path to sustainability.
