The Board of Directors of Beng Kuang is pleased 

to publish Beng Kuang Marine’s first sustainability 

report.  

 

The Board believes that sustainability is integral to 

the Group’s strategy and operation. It is about 

continuous 

improvement 

in 

identifying, 

understanding 

and 

responding 

to 

evolving 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

challenges that our business faces. We believe 

that 

ESG 

considerations 

help 

us 

better 

understand the challenges and impacts on our 

operations and assist us in striving to move in a 

sustainable direction.  

 

The management has taken efforts to seek the 

opinion of many stakeholders to understand the 

needs and expectations of our key stakeholders 

and have adopted a materiality analysis to identify 

material sustainability issues which are relevant to 

our businesses. We have reviewed topics 

covering social, economic and environmental 

issues 

and 

assessed 

them 

against 

our 

stakeholders’ concerns and interests. 

 

In the pursuit of our growth, we remain committed 

to conserving the environment, preserving natural 

resources and developing our people. 

 

Our sustainability efforts are led by senior 

management who ensures that our commitments 

to sustainable development are in line with our 

business objectives. The Board has considered 

the Group’s sustainability objectives despite the 

current global challenges the world faces which 

include climate change, shortage of natural 

resources and urbanization, we are still exploring 

strategic opportunities that may deliver greater 

long-term value. We reaffirm our focus on the 

long-term goal of delivering value to all our 

stakeholders.

Risk Assessment and Management (Precautionary Principle or approach) 

The Board, supported by the Audit Committee (“AC”), oversees the Group’s system of 

internal controls and risk management. The AC’s primary role is to assist the Board in 

ensuring the integrity of financial reporting and providing assurance that there is a 

sound system of internal controls in place. It is supported by Group Internal Audit, who 

provides independent assurance to the AC to ensure that the Company maintains a 

sound system of internal controls by regular monitoring of key controls and procedures 

and ensuring their effectiveness. Complete portfolios of risks were identified and 

assessed by management using the Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework 

and appropriate risk mitigation strategies had been adopted to address these risks 

strategically. 

 

A comprehensive set of governing policies and procedures of the main business 

processes such as cost management, supply chain management, financial risks, 

human resource and operational health and safety were established to provide 

guidance to the employees in managing each of these key risk areas. External 

assurance is engaged to perform audit on the effectiveness of the policies and 

procedures and any material non-compliance or failures in internal controls and 

recommendations for improvements are reported to the management and AC.  

 

As a testament to our commitment to quality, health and safety, many of our 

subsidiaries have been accredited with the ISO and OHSAS certifications.

Corrosion Prevention Division (“CP Division”)  

 

Our past vast record and reputation for reliability have enabled us to secure 

appointments such as “Resident Contractor” to provide corrosion prevention services 

in several established shipyards in Singapore and Batam, Indonesia. Our customers 

include Keppel Group of companies, Singapore Technologies Group of companies 

and DDW-PaxOcean Group of companies.  

 

Supply and Distribution Division (“SD Division”)  

 

SD Division carries over 400 types of products (marine hardware equipment, tools and

all of which are commonly used in the marine, offshore, oil and gas, construction and 

other industries.

from Australia to Vietnam, China, Indonesia and Malaysia and occasionally to South 

African countries. The 14 tugs and barges are all deployed in Indonesian waters, 

transporting mainly coal and building materials such as sand and aggregates. 

 

Supply Chain Management 

 

The Group’s main suppliers consist of raw material suppliers, equipment 

manufacturers, water distributors and suppliers of Marine and Industrial Hardware. We 

are committed to continue to build on ensuring a sustainable supply chain. 

 

Our Group Procurement Policy provides guidelines and control principles for various 

stages of the procurement process such as selection and evaluation of suppliers to 

minimize supply chain risk and other negative impact and also to enhance flexibility so 

as to ensure sufficient resources and effective capabilities. We also take effort to 

ensure diversification of suppliers which we believe that supplier diversity commitment 

not only adds economic value to our stakeholders as it drives price and service 

competition between the Group’s existing and potential suppliers and enhances 

innovation and encourages the growth of diverse business.

Sustainability Report – Material Topics

Defining the Materiality Issues 

 

Our material issues are identified based on the significance of our ESG and economic 

impacts and the degree of influence they have on stakeholder assessments and 

decisions. We develop our material topics in the light of fresh stakeholder feedback, 

new trends in sustainability, challenges facing the industries, experts’ views and our 

own business goals. We therefore focus our sustainability efforts and reporting on 

these issues. 

 

We have identified and compiled 5 relevant sustainability issues for developing this 

report. The issues were further deliberated and narrowed down through our 

engagement process with stakeholders.

Anti-corruption 

 

Business integrity is fundamental to our business. Our Group places great importance 

to “two-way” communication with its stakeholders by remaining transparent, efficient 

and open. 

 

We implement systems and processes to ensure accountability and responsibility 

throughout the organisation and across our relations with our stakeholders as we 

believe that good corporate governance establishes and maintains an ethical 

environment within the Group, which serves the interests of all shareholders and 

stakeholders. 

 

The Group has also put in place a Code of Conduct including anti-corruption policies     

and whistle-blowing arrangement whereby the employees may, in confidence, raise 

concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters 

to the AC Chairman. Arrangements are in place for the independent investigation of 

such matters for appropriate follow-up actions to be taken.  

 

The Group strives to preserve its past zero record in corruption cases.  We strictly 

enforce our values to our employees and ensure that our stand on corruption is clear. 

 

The Group’s Code of Conduct and anti-corruption policies illustrates the guidelines on 

key ethical issues which explicitly emphasises on dishonest, illegal, fraudulent, corrupt 

or other serious improper conduct which are communicated to all employees as and 

when necessary. Directors are also required to make declaration to uphold the Group’s 

spirit and core values to not engage in unethical practices.

energy efficiency, we promote the use 

of energy-efficient equipment and 

devices.
