Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors and Management of G. K. Goh Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its 

subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) are committed to creating long-term value for all its stakeholders 

through sustainable business strategies and practices. 

 

Together with Management, the Board identifies the key stakeholders, determines the material 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors to be managed, and oversees the management 

and monitoring of these factors. 

 

 

Organisation Profile 

 

The Group has evolved from its origins as a leading Singapore-based regional securities business into 

an investment company owning operating businesses as well as a diverse portfolio of investments. 

 

The Group has operating businesses in Corporate Services and Aged Care: 

 

 

The Corporate Services business is housed under Boardroom Limited (“Boardroom”), a leading 

regional corporate services provider in Asia and Australia. 

 

 

The Aged Care business is operated through Allium Healthcare Holdings Pte Ltd (“Allium”), which 

provides a suite of services emphasising a holistic continuum of long-term personalised eldercare.  

The portfolio in Singapore includes Allium Care Studios and Allium Care Suites, offering day care 

and residential care respectively.   

 

 

Allium has also invested in Opal Aged Care Group, a leading Australian provider of residential 

aged care services; and Habitat Assets Pte Ltd, a fund that invests in a portfolio of operating 

retirement villages in Australia. 

 

The Financial Investments arm holds a portfolio of listed and unlisted equities as well as third-party 

managed funds.  The largest single position is in Eastern &amp; Oriental Berhad, a Malaysian property 

development and hospitality group. 

 

 

Approach to Sustainability 

 

Sustainability to the Group is about creating long-term shareholder and social value by building and 

investing in well-governed companies that contribute positively to society.  Through Allium, the Group 

is making a commitment to play a constructive and progressive role in meeting the geriatric care needs 

of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population.  Allium opened its first Allium Care Studio in Joo Chiat in 

August 2018, and a second facility in Seletar Hills in March 2019.  Allium’s first Singapore nursing home, 

Allium Care Suites, started its operations in Venus Drive in November 2019. 

 

As an investment company, its sustainability work centres around supporting investee companies that 

implement sound values and structures for sustainable development. 

 

The Group also supports local businesses and helps to create jobs through the goods and services 

purchased from its suppliers, which includes office space providers, food vendors, technology and 

information services providers, as well as professional consultants.

Sustainability Reporting 

 

This report will outline only the sustainability policies, practices and performance of the Group’s Aged 

Care and Financial Investments business units for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 

(“FY2019”), and it is prepared in accordance with the following regulations, guidelines and framework: 

 

 

SGX-ST Listing Rules (711A and 711B); 

 

SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide; and 

 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2016 - Core.  The GRI Content Index can be found at 

the end of this report. 

 

The Group’s Corporate Services subsidiary, Boardroom, publishes its own sustainability report and this 

is separately appended at the end of the report. 

 

The Board has determined the reporting content on the basis of materiality assessment and 

stakeholders’ interests, expectations and concerns.  To ensure reporting quality, the Board has 

observed the principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness to help 

stakeholders assess the Group’s overall ESG performance.

Stakeholder engagement is crucial in helping the Board make informed commercial and policy decisions, 

and this is done through various platforms and channels.  Insights gained from such engagements are 

incorporated into the Group’s business strategies.  Key stakeholders are identified through Board and 

Management discussions.  The table below summarises the Group’s approach to stakeholder

Material ESG Factors 

 

Keeping in mind the key concerns of the Group’s stakeholders, the Board has identified the following 

material ESG factors for FY2019: 

 

 

Employees; 

 

Environment; and 

 

Anti-corruption. 

 

The Board will continue to identify and evaluate the material ESG factors against both the changing 

business landscape and key business developments to ensure that they remain relevant. 

 

 

Employees 

 

The Group recognises that its ability to remain commercially viable and competitive is influenced by its 

continued success in attracting and retaining talent.  It is committed to building a safe, nurturing and 

inclusive workforce where all employees are treated respectfully and professionally, and are given equal 

opportunity based on merit.  The remuneration framework for all employees comprises a fixed 

component in the form of a base salary and a variable component in the form of a bonus.  The bonus 

is linked to the Group’s and the employee’s performance. 

 

The Group encourages its employees to further their potential by supporting lifelong learning and skills 

development.  Employees who attend courses that are related to their fields of specialty are able to 

seek reimbursement for the course fees.  They are also entitled to 2 days of exam or study leave each 

year. 

 

In caring for the well-being of the employees, the Group offers a range of benefits to allow employees 

achieve better work-life balance.  These benefits include annual leave, parental leave, portable 

healthcare benefits and life and accident insurance.  The Group also offers flexible work options such 

as staggered working hours and work-from-home arrangements. 

 

As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s Aged Care and Financial Investments business units doubled 

their headcount and employed a total of 86 permanent full-time employees, all located in Singapore.  

There were no temporary or part-time employees.  The rates of new employee hires and employee 

turnover during the year were 81% and 28% respectively.  These numbers had increased significantly 

in FY2019 in line with expectation as the Aged Care business unit ramped up its operations.  The Group 

targets to reduce the turnover rate to below 20%.

Environment 

 

The Group’s construction of Allium Care Suites accounts for the majority of its direct environmental 

impact.  To manage its environmental footprint, the Group has committed to design and construct a 

green, sustainable building which is energy effective and resource efficient.  In 2019, Allium Care Suites 

became the first private nursing home in Singapore to receive the BCA Green Mark1 Platinum for its 

sustainable building. 

 

As a BCA Green Mark Platinum certified nursing home, it is designed and built with a climatic responsive 

design in mind.  Glass of low heat transmittance is used to ensure lower heat gain into the building.  

Minimising thermal heat gain through the building envelope and roof can enhance indoor thermal 

comfort and reduce the energy needed to condition the indoor environment. 

 

 

 

 

1 BCA Green Mark is a green building rating system to evaluate a building for its environmental impact and performance. It 

provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the overall environmental performance of new and existing buildings to 

promote sustainable design, construction and operations practices in buildings.

Allium Care Suites is also equipped with a building management system that monitors electricity and 

major water use.  The building uses energy-efficient unitary air-conditioning system and is fitted with 

LED lights with high frequency ballasts, thereby reducing flickering incidents which are damaging to the 

eyes.  Motion sensors are used at staircases, corridors and washrooms to moderate the luminaries and 

reduce energy usage when the areas are unoccupied.  The use of solar tubes draws in natural daylight 

from the third floor to the first floor of the building, and has a duo effect of saving energy as well as 

enhancing the illuminance.  Drawing on nature’s free resource, solar photovoltaic panels integrated with 

rooftop trellis provide shelter and replace a portion of the total building energy consumption. 

 

In terms of water efficiency, the building uses “Excellent” WELS-rated water fittings and a rainwater 

harvesting tank has been installed to collect rainwater for landscape irrigation.  In addition, the use of 

drip irrigation system over conventional sprinkler irrigation system ensures efficient and effective 

irrigation of the landscape. 

 

Alongside our energy and water conservation efforts, material selection is quintessential to Allium Care 

Suites.  Low carbon concrete certified by the Singapore Green Building Council is used for the 

construction of the building.  For the purpose of enhancing indoor environmental quality for occupants, 

low VOC paint is used for the finishing in the interior spaces.

Anti-corruption 

 

The Group adopts a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, and employees are expected 

to conduct their business activities in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  All 

employees are guided by a code of ethics and business conduct (“Code of Ethics”) and code of best 

practices on securities transactions (“Code of Best Practices”), which are disseminated to them at the 

start of their employment.  Further information on the Codes can be found in the Corporate Governance 

section of the Annual Report 2019. 

 

The Group has also developed a Procurement Policy to ensure that its procurement process is fair, and 

to reduce the risk of complaints and legal challenges.  The policy specifies the procedures in all aspects 

of the procurement process, from requests for quotations to dispute resolution, and will be reviewed 

periodically for relevance. 

 

The Group is pleased to report that there were no incidents of bribery or corruption during the year.

Our Commitment to Ethics and Integrity 

 

Similarly, the Board is committed to upholding high standards of good corporate governance, professionalism 

and integrity in the Company.  

 

We have based our corporate governance framework on timely disclosures, transparency and accountability, so 

that we can create, maintain and safeguard the value and interests of our shareholders. 

 

Integral to our commitment is the high priority we place on ethical business conduct, in markets where we 

operate.  

 

 

Professional Ethics of Our Employees 

Employees are expected to comply with our Code of Conduct (found within our Employee Handbook), which 

outlines the standards of behaviour in displaying responsible conduct, honesty and integrity. It also provides 

details on misconduct by employees – such as what actions constitute as misconduct, as well as the disciplinary 

procedures which the company will carry out if misconduct does occur. The Code also highlights grievance 

procedures for employees, free of reprisals, should they be treated unfairly. 

Client-serving employees are also required to conduct themselves according to the highest possible ethical 

standards, bound by BoardRoom’s adoption of the Professional Ethics Statements and Code of Conduct issued 

by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and the Chartered Secretaries Institute of Singapore where 

relevant.  

 

Anti-Corruption and Compliance 

 

To ensure that all employees are sufficiently informed about BoardRoom’s zero tolerance to corruption, all 

employees must undergo a briefing conducted by the legal counsel within the first month of their induction with 

the Company. We also have a strict policy regarding gifts from clients, where employees may not receive any gift 




 

 

 

8 

or advantage from any person or company with a business relationship with BoardRoom, without the knowledge 

and consent of the Director. 

 

No incidences of corruption or non-compliances with regulations (resulting in fines or non-monetary sanctions) 

were reported in FY19. 

 

Our Approach to Handling Complaints 

Our Whistle-Blowing Policy 

 

BoardRoom has in place a whistle-blowing policy open to all relevant internal stakeholders, such as directors, 

employees (full-time, part-time and contract), as well as external stakeholders such as vendors, clients and 

contractors, to raise complaints on any matter which could be a violation of our principles. 

 

This includes matters regarding accounting, auditing, internal or accounting controls which are questionable or 

not in accordance with generally-accepted practices prescribed by BoardRoom. It also covers serious concerns 

that could have an impact on the Company, such as unlawful acts, health and safety issues, actions that could 

cause environmental damage, the concealing of unethical actions or any other form of improper conduct. Our 

whistle-blowing policy also refers to any action taken by any employee which obstructs another employee to 

exercise his/her right to make such reports. 

 

Throughout 2019, we ensured that all employees had access to our whistleblowing policy by ensuring that it is 

available on our intranet (Learning Management System) and website. We will continue to work towards our 

goal of strengthening our whistle-blowing policy. 

 

Throughout 2019 complaints could be reported to the AC either in person or by emailing 

whistleblow@boardroomlimited.com.  

 

If a complaint was received, the AC would: 

1. conduct its own investigation of the complaint; 

Where necessary, it can also instruct the internal auditor or other third parties to conduct further 

investigations. 

2. inform the reporting party of the likely timeline for a final response; 

3. recommend any remedial or legal action to be taken, where necessary;  

The remedial action can be carried out by instructing relevant management or engaging other third 

parties. If there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed, the AC may also report the 

matter to the authorities. 

4. notify the reporting party on actions which are taken; 

If no action is taken, the AC will also provide a reason for the decision. 

 

Please note: the above was enforced throughout 2019, however, as a result of our delisting in August 2019, we 

have reviewed our process for whistleblowing and moving forward all complaints through the whistleblowing 

channel will be directed to the AC at G. K. Goh Holdings Limited.  

 

Our Non-Retaliation Policy 

 

We maintain a strict policy of non-retaliation, ensuring that parties are able to raise concerns through the 

whistle-blowing hotline confidentially and without fear of retaliation in any form. BoardRoom makes every effort 

to protect the identity of the reporting party and will investigate complaints alleging retaliatory action, such as 

disciplinary action against the reporting party. 

 

 

Our Complaints Handling Policy 

 

BoardRoom also has a separate Complaints Handling Policy targeted mainly at external stakeholders – such as 

vendors, clients and contractors – to lodge complaints against BoardRoom, its directors or personnel. The 




 

 

 

9 

objective of the Policy is to provide guidance on the manner in which we receive and handle complaints and to 

assist us in resolving complaints in an efficient, effective and professional manner. 

 

Through both our Whistleblowing Policy and Complaints Handling Policy, we seek to maintain our reputation as 

a company delivering high quality professional services, committed to maintaining our responsiveness to the 

needs and concerns of our clients. 

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2019 

We plan to increase and improve channels to 

receive whistleblowing cases by 2020 

Ongoing progress: 

Ensured that the policy is made available in our 

intranet (Learning Management System) and our 

website. 

 

Our Approach to Risk Management 

 

Risk Management Policy 

 

We also have in place a Risk Management Policy to acknowledge the risks involved in our business and mitigate 

it to the best of our ability. The policy aims to ensure that appropriate systems are in place to identify material 

risks facing the Company or to ascertain potential financial impact of identified risks. Measures and mitigating 

strategies are then adopted to manage exposure while responsibilities are delegated to handle these risks 

effectively.  

 

In our Singapore offices, we also have a Compliance Policy Manual, covering issues such as conflicts of interest, 

insider information and confidentiality, gifts and entertainment, client acceptance policy and prevention of 

activities related to money laundering and terrorism financing. 

 

Client Acceptance Policy &amp; Anti-Money Laundering Policy 

 

BoardRoom is committed towards the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. As such, 

we have various policies in place to ensure compliance and guarding against any transaction which may facilitate 

money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We also conduct regular trainings to ensure employees are 

aware of BoardRoom’s commitments.  

 

Our Procurement Practices 

 

As a service company, we procure goods and services mainly to support our day-to-day operations, including 

office rental, mailing, postage, recruitment and other administrative support services. To ensure that the 

procurement process in the Company is fair, consistent and transparent, our procurement policy requires that 

we obtain at least three quotations from different suppliers before final selection either by management staff 

or the Board of Directors. Most of our service providers are sourced locally for cost effectiveness and based on 

our commitment to support local economies where we operate. Environmental, social or governance criteria 

may also be considered when making procurement decisions. 

 

Recognition from the Association of Banks in Singapore (“ABS”) for strong governance 

In recognition of our high standards of integrity and internal controls, BoardRoom was one of the first payroll 

service providers in Singapore to receive an Outsourced Service Provider Audit Report (“OSPAR”) certification 

for payroll services. BoardRoom received the certification after a rigorous audit process by Ernst &amp; Young, a 

testament to the integrity and effectiveness of our internal controls, backed by safeguards of the highest 

standards. The assessment covered issues such as protection of client information, strength of data security, 

as well as the integrity and confidentiality of our workflow, service and processes.  

 

Developed by the ABS, OSPAR ensures that outsourced service providers such as BoardRoom have the same 

level of governance, rigour and control as financial institutions. We are proud to be certified once again for 

the year of 2019 and will work towards getting recognised again for the year ahead.

Chapter 5: Our Approach to Sustainability 

As one of the regional leaders in Corporate and Advisory Services, we also strive to demonstrate leadership in 

sustainability. In 2017, we took the first steps in our sustainability journey by publishing our very first 

sustainability report. In the same year, we also conducted a materiality assessment to help us focus on our most 

significant impacts, as well as set up a governance structure to manage our key environmental, social and 

governance issues. From employee engagement to reducing our operational footprint, we are on an incremental 

journey to embed sustainability into various aspects of our business. 

Our Sustainability Governance Structure 

 

 

 

* Please note Adrian Kow Tuck Hoong held the COO position until July 2019 when Jonathan Loy joined the company as 

Regional Operations Director 

 

 

Our Material Issues 

 

We define material issues as environmental, social and governance topics that have the largest influence on 

BoardRoom and our stakeholders. In 2017, we conducted our first materiality assessment to identify the 

sustainability issues to focus our efforts on. We undertook a three-stage process for the assessment: 

 

1. Desk-Based Research: Including a competitor benchmark and horizon scanning across our value chain; 

2. Stakeholder Engagement: Including internal interviews with departments and an online survey to 

engage external stakeholders; and  

3. Prioritising and Validation of Material Issues: A total of 14 sustainability issues were identified and 

ranked as high or low priority. 

This year, BoardRoom continues to report on our performance on the following 14 sustainability issues.

Embedding Digitalisation into Our Sustainability Strategy 

 

BoardRoom is going through an exciting period of digitalisation to enable us to secure long-term growth and 

maintain market leadership. At the same time, we have also harnessed the power of technology and 

digitalisation to help us with our sustainability performance. As such, we will be reporting on some of the new 

digital initiatives we have embedded into our sustainability strategy, which include: 

 

• 

product innovation: Expanding our digital product offerings for clients to better engage with their 

key stakeholders, such as investors, employees and clients; 

• 

strengthening cybersecurity: Utilising the latest technology to strengthen our defence against 

cyber threats; 

• 

upskilling our employees: Ensuring our employees are well-equipped with 21st century skills in 

areas such as Office Productivity, CRM and Virtualisation; 

• 

a more mobile workplace: Investing in cloud-based systems to create a virtual office, enabling our 

staff to increase productivity while improving work-life balance; 

• 

reducing paper usage: Rolling out of Project Charter across our offices, our initiative to implement 

a digital record and document management system, in order to reduce our paper usage. In 

addition, we also rolled out new innovative products for our clients to reduce their paper usage; 

and  

• 

employee engagement: Our internal Fun @ BoardRoom team plans and organises internal events. 

The F@B team is made up of representatives from each department to give every department a 

fair say in the events organised.  

 

 

Key: 

‘High’ priority:  Issues with high societal impact and concern to our stakeholders. They form the focus of 

our sustainability efforts and reporting. We will elaborate on our commitments and management practices 

on all of these issues in the chapters that follow. For each of the seven ‘high priority’ material issues 

identified, we have also set timely targets to track the continued improvement of our performance on these 

fronts. 

‘Low’ priority: Issues of relatively lesser importance, but still relevant to both BoardRoom and its 

stakeholders. We will actively manage and report on some of these issues as appropriate.

Chapter 6: Clients 

As a service-provider, our clients are integral to our overall success. We strive to deliver quality service that is 

unparalleled, providing clients with solutions which are both innovative and practical. As such, our core strategy 

on client management is to forge strong and enduring relationships to help us retain our position as one of the 

top choices for companies in Asia-Pacific seeking corporate and advisory services. 

 

Our strategy to provide the best service for clients is based on the following focus areas: 

 

Product Innovation 

To better serve client needs, we continue to invest in product innovation and expand our digital product 

offerings. These new products deliver productivity benefits and help our clients better engage with key 

stakeholders, such as investors, employees and clients, further differentiating BoardRoom from its peers as a 

provider of the latest cutting-edge products for corporate and advisory services. 

• 

Digital platform for Payroll Services In 2019 we launched our all in one cloud-based Human Resource 

Management Solution (“HRMS”) solution, Ignite by BoardRoom (“Ignite”). Ignite streamlines clients 

HRMS needs by eliminating the need for multiple payroll systems, reducing administrative burden 

through automation and ultimately increases productivity by offering the convenience of a cloud-based 

system that supports access anywhere and anytime. Not only is the platform user-friendly it comes with 

a mobile application. The mobile application allows for instant access to payslips, claims and leave 

functions to ensure clients and their employees have access to the things that matter 24/7.  

This new product builds on our continued success and commitment to product innovation since 2016, which 

include: 

• 

Digital platform for Employee Plan Services: We launched the latest addition to our suite of Employee 

Plan Services, EmployeeServe. This cutting-edge platform provides clients with real-time 24/7 access to 

their employee holdings, including transactions, balances, statements and advices, as well as the ability 

to instantly update personal information, accept employee plan offers, transact on vesting events, sell 

shares and view companies accounts. BoardRoom also provides end-to-end administrative services for 

clients to develop their own bespoke platform, starting from the design to the implementation phase. 

This new product enables clients to maximise participation rates and organisation productivity, while 

reducing company risk. 

• 

Innovative mobile investor relations platforms: We formed an exclusive alliance with Omni Market 

Tide, a market leader in digital engagement, to provide innovative mobile investor relations platforms 

to listed companies in Singapore and Hong Kong, laying the foundation for similar offerings in Taiwan, 

Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan and China. The applications include features to enhance the 

interconnectivity between companies and stakeholders, such as push communications, web streaming, 

shareholder voting, as well as access to company reports presentations and share price feeds. 

• 

Innovative application for securities registry market: We also launched an innovative application for 

the securities registry market in Australia. BoardRoom Digital Consolidated Application delivers a single 

online destination that combines smart technology with comprehensive real-time analytics, insights, 

news, statements, transactional and engagement features – benefiting clients, investors and employees 

by helping them to stay connected to the markets. 

We will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offering, striving to redefine 

how companies’ access, engage and transact with personal and market financial information.

Client Privacy and Data Protection 

 

To maintain client privacy and data protection, BoardRoom adheres to a strict policy never to disclose and 

provide client information to third parties without prior consent. For example, when client data is accessed 

during audits, we hold a strict policy not to allow the copying of any confidential documents. At least one finance 

coordinator must also be present to ensure no misappropriation of information takes place during the process. 

 

Enhancing Data Protection 

 

To further reduce our privacy-related risks, we engaged a third-party consultancy, Straits Interactive (“SI”), for 

the second time after our first engagement in 2016. Together with SI, we conducted the following activities in 

2019: 

• 

developed BoardRoom’s governance framework, policies and processes to address compliance gaps 

with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”); 

• 

reviewed Personal Data Protection governance framework, internal PDPA Policy, Internal PDPA Policy 

with General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) extensions, document retention policy, bring your 

own device policy, social media policy, standard operating procedure (“SOP”) pertaining to the 

collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal data; 

• 

identified BoardRoom’s privacy-related risks resulting from our operational processes and data flows 

which deal with personal data, and to implement appropriate controls and measures to further 

mitigate privacy-related risks. 

• 

Conducted PDPA and GDPR training by external vendor, Straits Interactive, for selected 

representatives from different Business Units or Support Units in Singapore who will act as a Data 

Protection Officer (“DPO”) for their respective units.  

• 

Online PDPA training for all staff planned in 2020. 

 

Staff Training: 

We recognise the importance of continually equipping our staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to 

function as in-house data protection officers. As such, SI also conducted three training sessions with hands-

on practice on the Straits’ Data Protection Management System (DPMS). The training session provided staff 

with a step-by-step approach to: 

- 

assess their personal data information assets; 

- 

conduct self-assessment for PDPA readiness; 

- 

perform an information security assessment and onsite audit; 

- 

monitor gaps and manage actions through an ongoing compliance dashboard; and 

- 

manage data breaches through an integrated response management system. 

 

Strengthening Cybersecurity 

In this age of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, we also recognise the need to invest in strengthening 

our defence against cyber threats. Some of our programmes and initiatives include: 

• 

Conducting annual penetration tests to assess our security policy, the level of security awareness by 

employees and our ability to identify and respond to security incidents; 

• 

Implementing firewalls and anti-virus softwares (e.g. Endpoint) to tackle the threat of ransomware; 

• 

Upgrading of our Guest WiFi; 

• 

Implementing encryption technology for stored data; and 

• 

Improving security handling in compliance with OSPAR. 

 

Staff Training: 

To ensure that our staff are also well-trained on cyber threats which they could potentially encounter in 

their line of work, we also conduct annual staff training and share emails whenever there are new or 

potential cases of phishing or IT-related security threats. 

 

For FY19, there were no material personal data breaches within the Boardroom Group.  

 

 

 




 

 

 

15 

“Compliance of the PDPA is an on-going process and Boardroom, with Straits’ knowledge, is continuously 

looking at ways to improve its policies and processes to address any PDPA compliance gaps as well as the 

controls and measures to mitigate its top privacy-related risks.” – Straits Interactive on BoardRoom’s approach 

to data privacy 

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2019 

We are committed to maintaining zero cases of 

customer data privacy breaches 

Ongoing Progress 

No material breaches reported in FY19. Continued 

education of all staff to raise awareness and build a 

culture of DPO’s within BoardRoom.   

 

Client Satisfaction 

 

BoardRoom has in place robust systems to track client satisfaction and will continue to develop our capabilities 

in this area. In all of our offices, BoardRoom’s team of client managers engage with clients on a frequent basis 

to maintain high client satisfaction. Many of our clients continue to renew their contracts with us and engage 

our services year after year. 

 

To more accurately measure client satisfaction, BoardRoom Australia has been using the Net Promoter Score 

(“NPS”), a management tool which measures the loyalty of customer relationships, adopted by more than two-

thirds of Fortune 1000 companies. Using NPS, we were able to identify clients which gave BoardRoom a lower 

score and work on managing these relationships in a more proactive manner. 

 

Drawing from the success of NPS in our Australia office, we are currently assessing the possibility of rolling out 

the system for additional offices and will continue to report on our progress. In addition, we are also looking at 

how staff can be trained to better service clients by better understanding their expectations and business 

requirements. 

 

Apart from NPS, we are exploring the use of technology to enable visibility over the full customer lifecycle, from 

onboarding through to termination to enhance our ability to track and retain clients.   

 

Our Target 

Our Progress in 2019 

We plan to accurately track and increase the 

number of retained clients by 2020 

Ongoing progress: 

Considering rolling out NPS across different offices, 

following success in Australia. 

 

Exploring the use of technology to enable visibility over 

the full customer lifecycle, from onboarding through to 

termination to enhance our ability to track and retain 

clients.

Chapter 7: Employee Engagement 

At BoardRoom, we recognise that every member of the team brings a unique set of talents and skills to our 

business. We strive hard to be an employer of choice, committed to ensuring that every employee feels 

engaged, motivated and proud to be part of our team. To that end, we work hard to create a diverse and 

inclusive environment for our employees to enjoy personal and professional growth alongside the Company.

Diversity and Inclusion (Gender)  

 

The distribution of employees across the various age groups and gender is diverse as we focus on talent and 

ability regardless of gender or age. We will continue to scout for new talent whose employability will not lie 

within factors out of their control. With a significant proportion of our senior management being women, we 

would like to challenge the notion that there is a glass ceiling that is holding women back from being in upper 

management.

Employee Remuneration and Benefits 

 

To reward our employees for their service and contribution to the Company, BoardRoom is committed to 

providing the best we can for them, both in terms of remuneration or additional benefits. On top of adhering 

strictly to the basic terms and conditions of employment stipulated by national laws in our countries of operation 

(e.g. the Employment Act of Singapore), we also aim to provide remuneration above the minimum standards set 

by the government, benchmarking salaries to industry standards and expectations. 

 

In 2019, our comprehensive package includes insurance – covering medical, specialist, health and safety, 

outpatient, hospitalisation, personal accident, critical illness, dental, executive health screening and term life – 

as well as leave for sickness, bereavement, marriage, maternity, paternity, childcare, unpaid infant care, study 

and exams.

Performance Management 

 

To ensure that our employees receive timely feedback on their performance and support to chart out their 

professional growth, we have put in place a comprehensive employee appraisal and performance management 

system. 

 

In FY2018, we implemented a new appraisal system in all our offices apart from Australia. We continue to 

utilise the system which defines positive behavioural characteristics for the managers based on our values of 

having and being: 

• 

open: Communicating in a manner that is open and transparent; 

• 

collaborative: Working closely with partners to develop solutions that are smart, customer-centric and 

easy to use; 

• 

driven: Measuring performance by our success; 

• 

performance: Having a team of diverse and experienced professionals to ensure our solutions are 

current and compliant to ISO standards; 

• 

passion: Genuinely believing that what we do makes a difference; 

• 

long-lasting: Nurturing relationships and helping to grow our business for the long term; 

• 

pro-active: Taking initiative to make things happen and respond to market demands in a timely 

manner; and 

 

2 Our employees in Australia are covered by a comprehensive national health insurance by the government and our office in Australia does 

not provide additional benefits on top of this. 

3 Our employees in China receive social insurance and a housing fund from the government, amounting to CNY 45,709.39 (or 

SGD9114.97).  




 

 

 

19 

• 

partners: Having diverse networks and partnerships to help us work effectively and efficiently across 

various industries. 

 

The work of all employees is appraised on a continuous basis through formal appraisal reports prepared annually. 

Through these appraisals, we track the performance, progress, future potential and development needs of our 

employees and help them to improve their performance. 

 

Training and Development 

 

Recognising the importance of continuous learning, we have invested resources to provide employees with a 

series of courses and workshops to aid in their professional and personal growth. This includes external courses, 

in-house courses and on-the-job training. 

 

Highlights of our soft skills training courses include: 

• 

digital skills in areas such as Office Productivity, CRM and Virtualisation; 

• 

train the trainer programmes on effective presentations, upskilling them in areas such as facilitation; 

verbal and nonverbal presentation delivery techniques – content which our more senior employees 

can in turn incorporate into their presentation programmes for their team; and 

• 

psychometric profiling for managers to help them match profiles for their team.  

 

The turnout and feedback for these training programmes have been positive, leading to improvements in our 

internal operations and how we respond to client needs. We will continue to invest in upskilling our employees 

in the coming year.

renovations and packing done. However, we will greatly increase our planned training sessions in the year of 

2020 to ensure that employees will continue to be well equipped with necessary knowledge and skills.    

 

Workplace Health, Safety and Well-Being (Employee Engagement) 

 

Flexible Work Arrangements 

In line with our transition to a mobile workplace, employees were all supplied with company issued laptops, 

enabling them to work from home based on their job functions. Accompanied with our investment in cloud-

based systems and virtual office, we are committed to maximising the use of digitalisation to increase 

productivity while improving work-life balance. We are in the midst of reviewing our flexible working 

arrangements and will provide details in our next report. 

 

Fun@BoardRoom Activities (Singapore) 

 

Health is wealth; hence the year of 2019 was largely focused on ensuring that employees under the Singapore 

BoardRoom office were well equipped with the knowledge for a healthier lifestyle. Through programmes 

organised by the Fun@BoardRoom (FAB) team like our annual health screening for employees, our staff 

enjoyed easy access to medical screenings and practical life skills. There were also beauty workshops that 

helped add value to their personal branding. The talks were well received, with slots being filled quickly and 

excellent turn out rates.   

 

 

Fun@BoardRoom Activities (Malaysia) 

 

To ensure we created an environment to develop and strengthen employee relationships with the merger of 

the Symphony Companies the Fun@BoardRoom team in Malaysia organised a series of team bonding 

 

 

 

26 June 2019: Stress &amp; the Body Lunch Talk was an

Chapter 8: Environmental Management 

As a professional services company, BoardRoom recognises that the greatest opportunities to lower our 

environmental footprint lie within the locations where our employees operate. As such, our environmental 

strategy is focused on ensuring we are as resource efficient as possible. 

 

This year, we focused our efforts on using technology to reduce our paper usage and need for travel, as part of 

our ongoing quest to reduce our operational footprint and environmental impact. 

 

Reducing Paper Usage 

 

Traditionally, due to the nature of being a corporate services business, the use of paper 

has been a staple of our standard operations. However, as digitalisation became more 

commonplace, we realised that a reliance on physical documents had landlocked our 

operations and was holding us back. Hence, to give our operations teams flexibility 

whilst reducing our carbon footprint through a reduction of paper usage, our first 

paperless initiative was kickstarted back in 2017. In 2018, Project Charter: Transition to 

Paperless, Cloud-Based Systems picked up where the first initiative left off and in 2019, we merged this into 

Project Paperless.  

 

It is important to note that for the paper we still use, we obtain from sources recognised by the Programme for 

the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).   

 

Progress achieved in 2019:  

• 

Phase 1 digitalisation of documents completed in Singapore, enabling the first steps to BoardRoom’s 

cloud-based ‘virtual office’. Preparation ongoing for a document management system, KRIS, to be 

implemented.  

• 

Implementation of ViewPoint for BoardRoom Malaysia, an entity management application that will be 

the single source of truth for client information that reduces the reliance on paper documents. 

• 

Gap analysis exercise successfully completed to modify initiative for BoardRoom Hong Kong. 

 

 

To further reduce the need for printing, we have invested in a 

number of additional systems to meet our target of setting up a 

cloud-based ‘virtual library’ for internal processes: 

• 

Electronic signing of documents (DocuSign); 

• 

Document management system providing employees with 

digital access to documents (“KRIS”); 

• 

Cloud systems for data storage (Office 365 initiative); 

• 

Enhanced customer relationship management systems 

(Salesforce Lightning); and 

• 

Online accounting (Xero for Accounting).

Total Time Cost Savings (Estimated) 

 

For offices which have started rolling out Project

on staff hours saved on filing and printing, as well as the 

cost saved on purchasing reams of paper. Across our 

offices, we saw estimated time cost savings of between 

1 to 5%.

We plan to reduce paper usage by 20% by 2019

46% reduction in paper usage (47% reduction for 

A4 paper, 12% reduction for A3 paper) 

 

Product Innovation to Reduce Paper Usage by Clients 

 

We have also been developing innovative new products to help our clients reduce their paper usage. We will 

continue to look for similar opportunities through product innovation. 

 

New application providing real-time digital information 

In 2016, our Australian office launched a new application allowing clients to view real-time information on 

markets and their investments digitally, reducing print and mail overheads. The application acts as a central hub 

providing digital information such as: 

• 

real-time push notifications including movements within the register, securities expiration; 

• 

directors interest reporting and other critical events and activities; 

• 

requests for beneficial ownership analysis; 

• 

comprehensive news section including legal and regulatory announcements; and 

• 

real-time access to equities holding, transaction statements.

Reducing Need for Travel 

 

Transition to Virtual Meeting Platforms 

 

To reduce the need for travel, we have also implemented systems for our employees to communicate virtually, 

such as Zoom and the 3CX phone system. These virtual meeting platforms have since been frequently utilised to 

conduct meetings, whether weekly, fortnightly or monthly. 

 

Reducing Energy Consumption and Efficiency 

 

A significant challenge faced by BoardRoom is that we do not own the buildings in which we operate. This limits 

our ability to control certain operational aspects such as the thermostat for the air-conditioning units, the type 

of light bulbs used and the amount of discharge by taps in toilets used. 

 

As a result of the increase in the number of employees due to the merger with Symphony in Malaysia, our 

electricity usage increased in FY19. While there has been an increase of about 5% in our electricity use, when 

put into context of an almost 35% increase in employees the numbers did not significantly increase with the 

expanded company. As we move forward, we will continue to educate our employees on ways to reduce their 

electricity usage as much as possible.  

 

Nonetheless, we continue to seek opportunities to improve operational efficiency.

Chapter 9: Community Investment 

In 2019, we remain committed to giving back generously to the society through CSR initiatives that have been 

warmly received by employees. It is through the support of our passionate staff that we can hold such 

successful CSR activities. We hope to inspire employees to contribute back to the causes that they support by 

giving them a platform where they are free to voice their suggestions by the setup of the Fun@BoardRoom 

team, where staff are able to plan their own internal activities according to their interests and passion.   

Key Highlights: 

Hong Kong 

Staff Volunteering 

 

Our colleagues in the Hong Kong office were 

awarded the Caring Company Logo for both 

Boardroom Corporate Services Limited (BCS) and 

Boardroom Share Registrars Limited (BRS). The 

Caring Company Scheme was launched by the Hong 

Kong Council of Social Service with the aim of 

recognising businesses for their commitment to CSR 

projects. BCS was nominated by Tung Wah Group of 

Hospitals and BRS was nominated by the S.K.H Holy 

Carpenter Church Community Center for working 

with them. They were also featured in the Senior 

Citizen Home Safety Association CSR magazine for 

their time spent volunteering under the Caring Call 

Service to engage with senior citizens over the 

phone through warm greetings and loving concern. 

 

 

Malaysia 

Fundraising &amp; Staff Volunteering 

 

The Malaysia team participated in Bursa’s Bull 

Charge Run on 14 November 2019, committing 

roughly RM 28,000 to participate in the Run. Funds 

raised from the Run were used to raise awareness, 

promote financial literacy and entrepreneurship 

while improving the lives of less privileged 

communities. As we value innovation, empowering 

the lives of the underprivileged by giving them the 

gift of knowledge is one of the best ways we can 

contribute back to society. Not only did the 

BoardRoom Malaysia team assist those in need 

monetarily, it was a healthy bonding session for our 

volunteers. Participants included Samantha, CEO of 

BoardRoom Malaysia, and Jacelyn, Executive 

Director who blazed the trail and inspired their 

members.
