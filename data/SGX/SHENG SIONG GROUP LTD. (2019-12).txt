Sheng Siong publishes its sustainability report on an annual basis.  This is Sheng Siong’s third sustainability report 

which covers the period between 1 January to 31 December 2019. The previous annual sustainability report was 

published in May 2019. This sustainability report covers all of the Group’s operations in Singapore. Sheng Siong 

does not have any major operations of significance overseas. Our operations in China contributes less than 2% to 

our revenue and we have excluded them from the scope of this report.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core Option. We have sought to apply the 

GRI reporting principles for defining report content and report quality. The GRI Content Index can be found in our 

online report on pages 76-82, which can be accessed from our corporate website. This report also includes the 

primary components as set out in Listing Rule 711B as required by the Singapore Exchange (SGX). We have not 

sought external assurance for this report. For any questions or comments, please address them to management@

OUR VISION

OUR MISSION

OUR VALUES

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

At the time of writing this statement, the world is dealing with COVID-19. This pandemic has sparked a global 

economic crisis and many businesses are heading into barely survival mode. 

As an essential service supporting Singapore in this unprecedented challenge, Sheng Siong remains committed 

to ensuring that daily needs are met, with measures in place to protect our employees, customers and the wider 

community. 

Even before it was made mandatory by the local government, we started our mask-up policy and provided 

disposable gloves for all our employees, as well as commenced taking our customers’ temperature. After the 

government implemented stricter measures, Sheng Siong worked closely with the government to roll out further 

changes in our operations, such as requiring customers to provide personal details for contact tracing, assigning 

employees as safe distancing ambassadors and increasing our stock of essential items. 

As global supply chains have been disrupted due to 

lockdown measures around the world, the need to 

have a diversified sourcing strategy has become ever 

more crucial. We continue to work closely with trusted 

suppliers to ensure minimal disruption, and at the same 

time activate alternate sources to increase our inventory, 

while keeping prices competitive. We will provide details 

on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a more 

comprehensive manner in our next sustainability report.

Our ability to tackle the issues related to COVID-19 is 

supported by a strong foundation established in our 

sustainability framework, which is built on five key pillars 

(Business Excellence, Care for Our Customers, Care for 

Our Employees, Care for the Community and Care for the 

Environment). Since our inaugural annual sustainability 

report, which was published in 2018, we have continued 

to strengthen our management practices on issues 

which are important both to the long-term success of 

the business and our key stakeholders.

JOINT MESSAGE FROM

THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CEO

HIGHLIGHTS IN 2019  

Business Excellence 

Technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace and 

we see its adoption as key to improving operational 

efficiencies 

and 

enhancing 

our 

customer 

experience. By early 2020, we expect to increase 

our storage and warehousing capacity by 18%, after 

we implement the Automated Storage and Retrieval 

System and expand our distribution centre. We also 

improved the Sheng Siong (SS) Enterprise App, 

allowing employees to conduct real-time inventory 

inquiry, sales monitoring and other operational 

business functions through their mobile phones, 

with plans to add more functions in the future. We 

continue to enhance the SS Connect App – currently 

in its pilot stage – to better connect, communicate 

and engage with our customers. Lastly, our Hybrid 

Self-Checkout System (HSCO) and cash withdrawal 

machine “$TM” have been successfully rolled out to 

all 59 stores. 

Care for Our Customers 

Healthy living is something that is becoming front 

and centre of our customers’ minds and we are 

committed to supporting that. We continue to 

introduce health and nutritional improvements in 

processed food products under our housebrands. In 

2019, we reduced the sugar content in our FOOJOO 

Calamansi Lemon and Orange Juice drink which 

now carries the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS). We 

also introduced new products with lower sugar or 

oil content, such as the Bake-for-you Nonya Kaya 

and Heritage Farm Nuts series, which also meet 

the HCS requirements. Our target is to have all our 

housebrand biscuits, cookies, snacks and instant 

beverages to be partially hydrogenated oil (PHO) 

free by June 2020, one year ahead of the effective 

date of the government ban. 

Care for Our Employees

Employees are the cornerstone of our business and 

it is therefore essential that we continue to look 

after their safety and wellbeing, while ensuring 

that they are given the opportunity to grow with 

the business. To prepare for the completion of our 

training supermarket in 2021 as part of the new 

extension of our headquarters and distribution 

centre, we embarked on a “train the trainers” 

programme with our partner ITE College Central. As 

part of this programme, our core team of trainers 

has 

been 

developing 

structured 

curriculum, 

materials, delivery and assessment methodologies. 

While the number of workplace accidents have not been reduced significantly, we have seen a reduction in the 

severity of incidents due to improved workplace safety measures.      























FOOJOO Juice Drinks now 

sport the HCS and contain a 

reduced sugar content

Participants at the “train the trainers” programme

As a testament to our efforts in caring for our customers, which also include engaging with them and making sure 

our products are fresh, safe and affordable, we are proud to share that our score on the Customer Satisfaction 

Index of Singapore (CSISG) has improved over the last few years. Our market share of Singapore’s grocery shopping 

industry has also grown from 14% in 2017 to 16.2% in 2019.



Care for the Community 

To support the rising cost of living in Singapore, especially for the vulnerable groups in the community, we 

extended our special 3% senior citizen discount programme for another year. We also launched the Merdeka 

Generation discount programme, by offering this group of senior citizens another 3% discount every Tuesday. 

The total discount provided under the two programmes was about $1.5 million. We also support the children of 

our lower-salaried employees through an education grant funded by the three founders of the Group. Last year, 

we disbursed a total of $464,800 to 558 children of our lower-salaried employees. 2019 also marks our fifth year of 

collaboration with the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) by hosting beneficiaries to 

work at our vegetable packing department. In addition, given the rising focus on food security in Singapore amid 

COVID-19, we continue to support local vegetable and egg farmers to achieve the national target of producing 30% 

of our nutritional needs locally by 2030.

LEADERSHIP COMMITMENTS 

TO SUSTAINABILITY

For more than 30 years, Sheng Siong has striven to 

excel in our mission to create sustainable value for 

our customers, with a core focus on good service, 

quality products, and reasonable prices. To achieve 

this, sustainability is a theme that pervades our 

business operations and strategy formulations.

Our sustainability journey is built on 5 key pillars. 

Each pillar represents different sustainability topics 

that we hold close to our hearts, as well as our 

commitments to change and/or influence positively 

in ways that remain relevant and accountable to our 

stakeholders.

JOINT MESSAGE FROM

THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CEO

prepare for NEA’s requirements for companies to 

implement mandatory reporting of packaging data 

and waste reduction plans by  2020. We have also 

been taking a more proactive stance to reduce the 

use of plastic bags by reviewing our operational 

procedures on the bagging of products, and saw a 

rate of reduction by about 6.5% compared to 2018. 

Looking Ahead  

As we navigate these uncertain times, we hope 

to continue working with our partners on our 

sustainability journey to build business resilience 

and create long-term value for our business and 

society. The rest of this report will provide you with 

a detailed update of our sustainability progress in 

2019. We would also like to take this opportunity to 

thank all our stakeholders for the support you have 

provided so far.

Care for the Environment

Climate change and waste continue to be key 

environmental issues facing the world and our 

industry, and we remain committed to do our part 

as a responsible business. To reduce our carbon 

footprint, we have been relying partially on the 

solar photovoltaic system installed at our Mandai 

Link Distribution centre for our energy needs. This 

year, the system supplied about 11.8% of our total 

energy usage at the distribution centre. In 2019, 

we adapted a framework initially targeted at our 

store operations, to encourage our office staff to 

adopt greener practices. This include turning off 

their monitors when not in use and increasing the 

air-conditioner temperature to at least 23°C. Our 

food waste co-digestion project, in collaboration 

with the National Environmental Agency (NEA), 

was extended to all 59 stores – including our 

distribution centre – resulting in about 3,035 

tonnes of waste diverted from landfill. We continue 

to explore opportunities to reduce packaging 

waste and were conferred the Excellence Award 

by the Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA) for 

our exemplary efforts. We are currently working 

on improving our data collection system to

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Sheng Siong Board is the highest governance 

body consisting of the Executive Chairman, 

Executive Vice-Chairman, CEO, Managing Director, 

Executive Director, one Non-Executive Director, and 

four Independent Directors. Our Board of Directors 

has expertise in the fields of business management, 

finance, law, real estate, and food safety, and 

contributes positively to strategy formulation and 

risk mitigation. 

Together, 

the 

Board 

and 

Management 

are 

responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk 

management framework and policies, and reviewing 

their effectiveness for all economic, environmental 

and social topics. While the Executive Management 

meets regularly, the Board reviews our Group’s 

sustainability topics at least once a year. 

Sustainability topics are considered by the Board as 

part of its strategy formulation. 

Since 2015, the Group has established a Business 

Excellence Committee at the management level 

to review and discuss the topics of innovation and 

business excellence, including risk management. 

In 2018, the Group established a Risk and Business 

Continuity Committee, to dedicate better oversight 

on risk management and business continuity issues. 

Both committees report to the CEO.

The Sustainability Committee was set up in 2017 

to provide oversight of the Group’s material ESG 

topics. The committee is led by our Executive 

Director, Lin Ruiwen, and comprises members 

from senior management of key business functions 

such as operations, human resource, quality 

assurance, finance, procurement, IT and corporate 

communications. The committee is responsible for 

formulating sustainability policies, championing 

sustainability 

projects, 

and 

monitoring 

its 

effectiveness and performance targets.

We conducted stakeholder consultation in the 

identification and management of sustainability 

material topics. Members act as champions of 

sustainability topics within the Group, and meet 

regularly to review, discuss and identify potential 

environmental, social and governance risks that 

Sheng Siong is susceptible to, as well as to monitor 

BUSINESS VALUES AND ETHICS 

Our core values were developed over years of 

engaging with our key stakeholders in fulfilling 

our mission to serve the needs of our customers 

and creating sustainable value for them. The eight 

core values guide our employees to be reasonable, 

harmonious, responsible, dedicated, earnest and 

efficient at work, with no empty promises and 

excuses. These are the cornerstones of how we 

conduct ourselves and foster valuable relationships 

with our stakeholders. We also observe a high level 

of business ethics by working closely with regulators 

to ensure we comply with the relevant regulations.

Sheng Siong strives to build trust, transparency, 

integrity and reliability in our relationships with our 

stakeholders. Our core values and employee code of 

conduct are communicated to our staff through our 

Employee Handbook which is written in both English 

and Chinese and during regular meetings with our 

staff, suppliers and vendors. The management 

reviews these values and code of conduct regularly.

Our high regard for ethics is further displayed in 

our strong organisational culture and belief of 

unchanging moral principles - “With morality as 

our bedrock, we continue our legacy by setting 

self- expectations to walk the talk and to be good 

examples for others. With this, we will conquer all 

odds and ensure the continuity of Sheng Siong”.

our progress and performance. The Committee then 

evaluates and provides advice and recommendations 

to the CEO and Board of Directors on the areas 

for improvements, and possible strategies and 

actions concerning these topics. The Committee 

is also tasked to work with relevant departments in 

executing the approved strategies and actions.

Once a year, key employees are required to declare 

any potential conflicts of interest, and all employees 

are earnestly reminded of the Group’s anti-corruption 

policy on accepting gifts and favours. The Group 

policies on conflict of interest and anti-corruption 

serve to guide our employees in their conduct of 

day-to-day business and in managing our trading 

relationships with suppliers. Our suppliers are also 

required to sign a Master Agreement which specifies 

the terms and conditions and appropriate behaviour 

when trading with us. Sheng Siong’s whistleblowing 

policy is championed by the Audit Committee at the 

board level. Our whistleblowing procedure enables 

employees or any other persons to raise concerns 

in confidence, without fear of reprisal in any form. 

The management places great importance to this 

so much so that the personal contact information of 

our senior management, including our CEO’s, can be 

found outside our store for ease of reach. 

Our employees can access these policies on Sheng 

Siong’s intranet as well. More information on our 

approach to anti-corruption and anti-competition 

can be found in the Business Excellence chapter of 

this report.

OUR APPROACH

TO MATERIALITY

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Through an internal stakeholder mapping exercise, we have identified seven key stakeholder groups which we 

prioritise our engagements with. These include groups which our business has a significant impact on, and those 

which have a high interest in or considerable influence on the success of our business.

As we adopt sustainability perspectives in our management systems and business strategies, we recognise that 

different stakeholders may have competing priorities. Through our tailored stakeholder engagement approach, 

we hope to better understand their needs and expectations as well as to communicate how we are managing 

the topics of concern. The Group uses the sustainability report as the primary channel for communicating our 

sustainability efforts to our stakeholders.

STAKEHOLDERS

IMPACT &amp; SIGNIFICANCE

Customers

Our customers are the foundation of our business success. We strive to create value 

sustainably for our customers by providing a convenient and comfortable shopping 

environment with good service and quality products at reasonableprices. We want to be 

able to be stay relevant and responsive to their evolving needs.

Employees

Our employees’ performance is critical to the success of our business. They are part 

of our human capital and their health, safety and well-being, and  competencies are 

fundamental to Sheng Siong’s operational effectiveness. We  aim to develop their potential 

to drive innovation, productivity and organisational  excellence through promoting 

close, transparent and direct communication  between employees and higher-level 

management.

Suppliers

Sheng Siong works closely with partners in our value chain to ensure that food and 

products are in line with industry safety standards, to improve product range and food and 

service quality, and to reduce risks related to sustainability issues.

Government 

Agencies

Besides regulatory compliance, we partner with key government agencies to jointly raise 

industry standards for food and product safety, food security and other sustainability 

practices, as well as workplace safety and health standards.

NGOs &amp; 

Voluntary 

Welfare 

Organisations

Our business activities have economic, environmental, and social impacts on the 

communities where we operate. Therefore, it is critical that we give back to our 

community and work with industry associations, educational/research institutions as well 

as not-for-profit bodies to promote sustainability along the Group’s value chain. This may 

range from influencing shopper behaviour to raising industry standards.

Media

News and information outlets are one of the main sources of information for our 

stakeholders and the public. We aim to engage the media to understand societal 

expectations of the food retail value chain and to influence shopper behaviour positively.

Shareholders/

Investors

Our investors play a vital role in the success and growth of our Group. The investment 

community is a feedback loop for the Group’s formulation of its growth strategies. 

We strive to maximise shareholder returns, observe good corporate governance and 

improve levels of transparency through the timely communication of our financial and 

sustainability reporting.

OUR APPROACH

TO MATERIALITY

Table 2: Stakeholder Engagement Activity Matrix (continued)

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT &amp; TOPIC BOUNDARIES

Materiality in relation to sustainability is an important principle as it helps us to identify and prioritise the 

economic, environmental and social topics that impact the success of the business and that matters most to 

our stakeholders. The outcomes of our materiality assessment will be used primarily to inform our sustainability 

strategy, management approach and report content.

We periodically review our material topics against the changing business landscape, regulatory environment, 

emerging global and domestic trends, industry best practices, as well as stakeholder opinions to keep abreast on 

issues that matter to the business and its stakeholders and to stay relevant and responsive to their needs.

In 2018, Sheng Siong commissioned an independent consultant specialising in sustainability to conduct a 

materiality assessment, based on current and emerging trends, stakeholder perspectives and our list of 

previously identified material topics. A three-step approach (shown in figure 1) was adopted in the determination 

and prioritisation of our material sustainability topics.

ENGAGEMENT

PRIORITISATION,

VALIDATION AND

ENDORSEMENT

A benchmarking exercise and desktop research were 

conducted to assess if there were any key or emerging 

topics not included from Sheng Siong’s original list of 

material topics. This was to ensure that Sheng Siong 

has a comprehensive picture of what topics might be 

material and to form the basis of the engagement stages. 

The list was then consolidated through the grouping of 

related topics. The outcome was a shortlist of 17 topics for 

prioritisation.

An analysis was done to consolidate the results gathered 

to produce a preliminary list of material topics prioritised 

by internal and external perspectives, represented in the 

form of a materiality matrix. A working session was held 

with the Sustainability Committee to review, test and 

validate the final list of material topics and the materiality 

matrix. The prioritised set of material topics were 

presented to the Board for review for final endorsement.

Using the findings gathered from Step 1, an online survey 

was distributed to both internal and external stakeholders 

(including customers) to gather perspectives on what the most 

important sustainability topics are for the business to prioritise. 

The survey uses both the Likert scale (rating from 1-5) and a 

ranking system, in addition to qualitative questions to gather 

feedback. The surveys yielded more than 1500 responses from 

employees across the business and 179 responses from external 

stakeholders including suppliers, government agencies, NGOs, 

VWOs, media and shareholders. The results were weighted 

to ensure a balanced representation of the varying views and 

priorities of the different stakeholder groups.

NARROWING OF TOPICS THROUGH PRIORITISATION

MONITOR, REPORT, REVIEW

Figure 1: Materiality Assessment Process

Figure 2: Materiality Matrix

The materiality matrix below (Figure 2) shows the output from the materiality assessment. A comprehensive list 

of 17 material topics considered was plotted against the x-axis, which shows the importance of each topic on the 

business, and against the y-axis, which shows how important each topic is for Sheng Siong to manage according 

to external stakeholders.

The priority topics are those that internal and external stakeholders view as the highest importance for Sheng 

Siong to manage and report on. The topics ranked ‘Moderate’ are less critical and of lower relative importance 

to both internal and external stakeholders. However, we believe that they remain relevant and should be actively 

managed and reported to an appropriate degree according to business priorities and stakeholder needs.

In 2019, the Sustainability Committee, in consultation with the Board, concluded that there were no changes to our 

material topics identified although the Group observed that the following topics have increased in importance.

• More public awareness on environmental issues such as plastic reduction due to Singapore’s “Towards Zero 

Waste” vision and recent “Say ‘YES’ to Waste Less” Campaigns. 

• More incidents of scams mis-using Sheng Siong’s intellectual property led to heightened stakeholder views 

on cyber-security and customers’ data protection. 

• Greater concern by employees about their health and safety.

• Greater concern by employees about job security and benefits given economic uncertainties.

Our response to managing these rising concerns is detailed in the respective chapters of this report.

     Satisfaction

Customers are the foundation 

of our business and therefore 

it is imperative to ensure that 

we manage their needs and 

concerns properly as well as 

provide better service and 

experience within stores and 

online.

• Care for our Customers

play by providing healthier 

and more nutritious options 

for our customers.

• Care for our Customers

We take the opportunity to review nutritional 

improvements of our products by paying close 

attention to market trends and observations.

We also believe that our customers will benefit from a 

wider range of more affordable fresh produce.

Conduct a stock take of 

our range and selection 

of ‘healthier choice’ and 

‘trans fat free’ products to 

determine the baseline for

profiteering or anti-

competitive practices.

8. Customer 

     Privacy and 

     Cyber Security

In light of recent and increasing 

threats of cyber crimes, 

customers who entrust their 

personal data to us would 

expect that their information is 

protected and not misused.

With the increasing use of 

technology in our business 

operations,  it  is  critical to 

safeguard our information 

technology systems against 

cyber threats in order to 

maintain the viability of our 

business.

• Business Excellence

• Care for our Customers 

Our IT policy comprises of regular risk assessment 

that allows us to monitor and establish safeguards 

within our systems to prevent breaches. We have also 

established a business continuity plan (BCP) which 

focuses on the recovery of technology facilities and 

platforms, such as critical applications, databases, 

servers or other required technology infrastructure for 

the viability of the business. We review our policy and 

BCP regularly to make sure they are relevant.

Ensure all of our employees 

are aware of and understand 

our Group’s personal data 

protection policy (PDPC).

Provide education and 

awareness on cyber security 

among our employees of 

managerial roles through 

talks and workshops.

9. Food and 

     Product Safety

Safeguarding food and 

product safety is a basic 

founding principle of our 

business, and is essential for 

our success. We recognise 

our  responsibility  as the 

final gatekeeper in the supply 

chain to safeguard the health, 

safety and interests of our 

customers.

Building a strong trusting 

relationship with our 

customers fosters their 

loyalty to continue to shop 

with Sheng Siong.

• Care for our Customers

We monitor our performance in food and product safety 

through certification assessments such as HACCP and 

ISO 22000:2005 Food Safety Management System.

An in-house Quality Assurance Programme is in place 

to ensure that our products meet stringent quality 

standards, and our stores and processing facilities 

meet hygiene, sanitation, and processing standards in 

order to comply with regulations. Any non-compliance 

may warrant a warning or fine from the regulatory 

authorities and is informed through this report.

Work closely with the newly 

formed Singapore Food 

Agency to ensure that our 

farm fresh produce and 

processed food products 

are compliant with 

Singapore’s stringent food 

safety standards, and that 

our food handling processes 

comply with the relevant 

food hygiene standards.

Continue to be certified by 

ISO 22000:2005 for food 

safety management.

Improve our internal food 

and product safety, as 

well as quality assurance 

programme, by setting more 

measurable targets.

10. Responsible 

       Marketing 

       and Product 

       Labelling

Similar to safeguarding food 

and product safety, the process 

of building trust and loyalty also 

includes providing accurate 

and sufficient product and 

marketing information for 

shoppers to make informed 

choices.

• Care for our Customers

We require all our suppliers to comply with the 

Singapore Sale of Food Act which includes food 

labelling requirements. Any non-compliance may 

warrant a warning or fine from the regulatory 

authorities and is informed through this report.

committed to reducing the 

amount of waste generated 

and supporting a circular 

economy.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), comprising 17 of the world’s most pressing challenges, were endorsed 

by the UN in 2015 to achieve the underpinning 169 targets by 2030. 

While Sheng Siong has been contributing to sustainable development in several ways over the years, we believe it 

is important for us to communicate our commitment towards supporting the SDGs.

We have selected four goals to focus on after reviewing each of the SDGs based on where our business can make 

the biggest impact. These four goals will be used to inform our sustainability strategy and relevant targets going 

forward and we will report on our progress accordingly.

BUSINESS EXCELLENCE 

PARTNERSHIPS FOR SMART BUSINESS

A FORERUNNER FOR NEW PROCESS AND 

TECHNOLOGY

Sheng Siong strives to be a forerunner in the 

adoption of new processes and technology that 

improve operational efficiencies and productivity, 

simplify workflow and enhance customer experience 

to achieve outstanding performance. This earned us 

the SPRING Innovation Excellence Award in 2015.

We continue to work closely with key partners such 

as Enterprise Singapore to develop and adopt new 

processes and technology to improve our business 

capabilities. This is an important foundation for us 

in our plan to expand into the international market.

Riding on the momentum towards building a 

Smart Nation, we have adopted the following new 

technologies and made improvements to existing 

ones. 

Expansion of Distribution Centre

The expansion of our Distribution Centre was 

completed in March 2020. The new extension sees 

a boost to our storage and warehousing capacity by 

about 18%, due to our adoption of the Automated 

Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS). The system 

automatically 

places 

and 

retrieves 

products 

and inventory on demand from defined storage 

locations, which helps us to save floor space, 

improve safety, and increase productivity.

Improve Goods Receiving and Distribution of Fresh 

Food

The goods receiving and distribution process of 

fresh produce such as seafood and meat by weight 

has been time-consuming and prone to errors. Last 

year, we implemented a new PC-based weighing 

scale which is programmed to integrate with our 

inventory management and distribution systems 

at our distribution centre. This has shortened 

suppliers’ waiting time at delivery, and as a result, 

enabled us to distribute fresh produce to our retail 

stores more efficiently and accurately. This program 

has been successfully rolled out to our purchase 

station in the Jurong Fishery Port (JFP) in 2019.

Connecting with our Customers through Sheng 

Siong (SS) Connect

As society becomes more digitally connected, it 

is paramount that Sheng Siong also explores ways 

to better connect, communicate and engage with 

our customers. We created the SS Connect App 

with this vision in mind. At its pilot stage, we have 

included features such as in-store promotion alerts, 

auto-completion of Sheng Siong’s mega promotion 

lucky draw entry form, e-receipts, purchase history 

records and store locator. We envision SS Connect 

to play the role of a shopping assistant to our 

customers and see ourselves adding more exciting 

functions and features in the near future.

Enhancing 

Customers’ 

In-Store 

Experience 

through Technology

Between 2015 and 2019, we successfully rolled out 

our Hybrid Self-Checkout System (HSCO) in all our 

61 stores. The HSCO has allowed us to successfully 

reduce customer waiting times at checkout by 

more than 30 seconds, while freeing up cashiers 

and tellers to take on roles that enlarge the scope of 

their responsibilities and skill sets.

Enhancements to the Suppliers’ Portal

We continue to enhance our suppliers’ portal to 

include new features to facilitate communication 

with our suppliers and simplify administrative 

procedures. This enables our clerical staff to free 

up their time to take on job roles with greater 

responsibilities which require greater skill sets.

Integration of Business Processes under the Sheng 

Siong (SS) Enterprise App

We have started to integrate some of our business 

processes under the SS Enterprise App, a mobile 

application that facilitates operational business 

functions such as purchase order (PO) approvals, 

real-time inventory inquiry and sales monitoring 

– all conducted through the mobile phone. We 

will continue to include more functions within 

the app, such as human resource management, 

inventory management, logistics management 

and even supplier management. As work is likely 

to be less desk-bound in the future, we believe new 

technology such as these will have a lasting impact 

on productivity and efficiency.

















































































Experimenting with Data Analytics

We are working to improve our capability on data 

analytics, going beyond simple sales analysis to 

discovering more useful information to support our 

business functions and decision-making. 

“When I first started working as a cashier, I 

have to manually count the cash float before 

and after every work shift. Especially for 

newcomers, they would be very worried 

about giving the wrong change to customers. 

With the implementation of the Hybrid Self-

Checkout System (HSCO), we can focus on 

scanning and bagging the products for our 

customers, while payment is done at the 

payment kiosk. As a chief cashier now, I feel 

that the HSCO has simplified and streamlined 

the payment process for my colleagues. 

While customers find it quick and convenient 

to checkout, our cashiers can focus on 

serving and interacting with customers.”

PARTNERSHIPS FOR SMART BUSINESS

Singapore’s first “recycling” cash withdrawal machine, 

which we call “$tm”, is now available across all our 

stores. We top up the $tm machines with cash from our 

supermarket sales, and customers are able to withdraw 

money from their bank accounts using their DBS, POSB, 

OCBC or UOB ATM cards. This reduces the amount of 

cash required to be collected daily and deposited at 

the bank by our cash handling service provider, thereby 

enabling us to save on cash handling charges. This 

should improve productivity across our stores nationally 

as cash is recycled at our stores, eliminating the stage 

in which it is transferred to the banks and then back to 

their ATMs. Even as we move towards a cashless society, 

we believe such a system remains crucial as cash will 

continue to play a role in society, albeit a diminished one.

COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ON 

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-COMPETITION

Our policy on anti-corruption is disseminated 

to all our employees, our Board and Executive 

Management. We have a set of guidelines specifying 

the responsibilities of each employee to observe 

and uphold Sheng Siong’s zero- tolerance stance 

towards all forms of corruption and collusion. It also 

provides information and guidance to employees on 

how to recognise, address and prevent instances 

of corruption and collusion which may arise in the 

course of their work.

Key personnel identified as holding sensitive 

positions are also required to declare any conflicts 

of interest and sign an agreement with the company. 

In 2019, we had zero incidents of corruption and 

zero cases of legal actions for anti-competitive 

behaviour.

Managing Risk of Petty Theft

We continue to work closely with the Singapore 

Police Force to deter shop theft. Some initiatives 

include raising awareness on the A.S.K. Protocol, 

a 3-steps procedure for our frontline colleagues 

to take in deterring thefts, and placing publicity 

materials at our stores to enhance deterrence. 

To deter shop theft, Sheng Siong supermarket 

employees double up as security officers and wear 

vests bearing the words “SHOPWATCH”. At the same 

time, they assist our customers with their shopping 

needs, thus promoting quality customer service. We 

channelled the financial savings from hiring security 

officers to awards for our employees and customers 

who identify potential incidents of petty theft. 



“My impression of workshops is that the sharing is usually 

quite conceptual. However, our cybersecurity in-house 

workshop has really left its mark on me. The information 

shared across is directly relatable to my work scope and the 

company’s practices. Also, it corrects the mistaken belief 

that cybersecurity only involves the IT department. In reality, 

every department plays a part in safeguarding the company’s 

interests by being informed and vigilant towards spear 

phishing, ransomware and business email compromise.”

Ms Lee Shu Leng (29, Accounts Associate)



In 2018, outreach talks were conducted for our 

senior and middle management staff. This includes 

a session conducted by the Corrupt Practices 

Investigation Bureau (CPIB) on anti-corruption 

laws in Singapore, and a session conducted by the 

Competition &amp; Consumer Commission Singapore 

(CCCS) on the Anti-Competition Law and Consumer 

Protection Fair Trading Act in Singapore.

We recognise the importance of conducting an 

ethical and fair business with our suppliers and 

strive to improve transparency in our business 

dealings.



PARTNERSHIPS FOR EXCELLENCE

In 2018, we signed an MOU with ITE to formalise a partnership for student and staff development through 

collaborations in areas such as internship opportunities, attachments for ITE staff and industry projects related 

to Sheng Siong’s business and operations. By 2019, we have recruited interns from ITEs and sent our trainers for 

training in a program specially tailored to our needs, alongside the set-up of our supermarket training centre. We 

believe that our partnership will bring about opportunities for learning and innovation for both organisations, and 

enhance the practical training for students who will form the future workforce in the retail business industry.

PROTECTING OUR DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE &amp; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The digital transformation of our business brings increasing cybersecurity threats. We recognise the growing risk 

and have taken steps to secure and protect our digital infrastructure and intellectual property. Besides regular 

monitoring and establishing safeguards within our systems to prevent breaches, we have also established a 

business continuity plan which focuses on the recovery of technology facilities and platforms, such as critical 

applications, databases, servers or other required technology infrastructure for the viability of the business.

CARE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS

A RESPONSIBLE RETAILER

GATEKEEPER OF CONSUMER HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

As a supermarket operator, we recognise our responsibility as the final gatekeeper in the supply chain to safeguard 

the health, safety and interests of our customers. Our promise to our customers is based on three core pillars: 

Quality, Service and Price. We take responsibility in providing accurate and sufficient product and marketing 

information for shoppers to make informed choices. We also protect the privacy of personal information that our 

customers entrust to us.

In the supermarket retail business, the supply chain is a long and complex one. We work with over 1,000 local 

and international suppliers including farmers, manufacturers, local distributors, concessionaires, importers and 

exporters. They supply to us a wide range and variety of groceries, household products and fresh produce.

As we work with various types of suppliers, the boundaries for some of these material topics may be beyond our 

reasonable purview. However, we seek to continuously improve the selection procedures of our suppliers and 

products, while monitoring their operation standards. We recognise our ability to influence our supply chain, and 

strive to do so positively within reasonable means.  

540 employees were rewarded for good service rendered to our customers in 2019 (compared to 326 in 2018 and 

284 in 2017). To fulfil the evolving needs of our consumers, 46 of our stores (out of 59 as at end 2019) are opened 

24-hours. During Chinese New Year in 2019, 24 of our stores remained open during the two days of public holiday. 

In addition, we continue to offer our e-commerce “allforyou.sg” online grocery shopping service to customers who 

prefer the alternative shopping platform. We will continue to explore further ways to leverage on technology to 

improve our efficiency and last-mile delivery.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Sheng Siong’s tagline “All for you” reflects our 

organisation’s focus on customer care and 

service. It is one of the Group’s key objectives 

to constantly improve consumer experience at 

all our retail outlets. Our score on the Customer 

Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) has 

improved consistently over the last few years.

Customer Engagement

In 2018, we re-launched the Sheng Siong Facebook page. By 2019, we had close to 70,000 followers. Our presence 

on social media platforms allow us to better communicate and engage with our customers, in a more direct 

manner, providing customers with greater accessibility to after-sales care. However, the improved accessibility 

also meant we received more feedback in 2019, bringing our complaint to compliment ratio to 1.4 (compared to 1.3 

in 2018 and 1.02 in 2017). We appreciate the enhanced communication and engagement with our customers, as we 

believe that the constructive feedback provided will keep us grounded and help us better understand the needs 

of our customers.

HEALTHIER DIET CHOICES, HEALTHIER SINGAPORE

We care about our impact on consumer health. This 

is why we seek continuous improvements on the 

health and nutritional standards of processed food 

products under our housebrands. This is in line with 

the national movement towards leading a healthier 

lifestyle, which saw the Health Promotion Board 

(HPB) introduce the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) 

programme for packaged food products to help 

consumers make healthier choices in their grocery 

shopping.

Less Sugar

In 2019, two products - FOOJOO Calamansi Lemon 

Juice Drink and FOOJOO Orange Juice Drink – were 

reviewed for possible nutritional improvements 

and were successfully reformulated to reduce the 

AFFORDABILITY OF DAILY NECESSITIES

We continue to collaborate closely with government 

agencies such as the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) 

and SingStat to monitor excessive price increases 

in daily necessities to address profiteering and 

anti-competitive practices in Singapore. In 2019, 

we took a step further and supported the launch 

of the Price Kaki mobile application developed by 

the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), 

supported by the Ministry of Trade and Industry 

(MTI). Price Kaki allows consumers to compare and 

contribute in-store retail and promotional prices 

of common household items and groceries on its 

platform, thereby empowering consumers to make 

informed purchasing decisions.

Diversification is also practised in our sourcing and 

procurement strategy to ensure a sustainable supply 

of food and products at a stable and affordable 

price. Regular market research and benchmarking 

are conducted to ensure that Sheng Siong provides 

the best value in a basket of essential goods.

level of sugar content. The two products now meet 

the nutritional standards set by HPB and carry the 

HCS logo. An additional 3 flavours of the juice drink 

(Apple, Mango and Pineapple) carrying the HCS logo 

were also introduced into the market.

For new products, we plan to develop them in line with 

the nutritional standards of the HCS. For example, 

we launched the ‘Bake-for-You Nyonya Kaya’ series 

in 2019, comprising of a ‘No Added Sugar’ and ‘Less 

Sugar’ variants. The ‘No Sugar Added’ variant uses 

maltitol as a sugar substitute which brings a slower 

rise in blood sugar and insulin levels as compared to 

refined sugar. Again, these products were specially 

formulated to meet the nutritional standards of the 

HCS programme.

Trans Fat Free

In total, we now have 83 housebrand products 

(compared to 65 in 2018, and 25 in 2017) carrying 

the HCS logo, and 216 housebrand products (186 

in 2018) that are trans fat free. These include 

canned seafood, canned vegetables, canned fruit, 

rice, confectionaries, cooking oil, titbits, instant 

beverages, canned tuna and condiments. 

Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO) is the main source 

of trans fat in the Singaporean diet and is linked 

to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.  Four 

Less Oil

We also launched the ‘Heritage Farm Nuts’ series 

- Heritage Farm Cashew Nuts, Almonds, Baked 

Pistachios and Walnuts. Instead of oil roasting 

these nuts, we offer a healthier alternative to our 

customers by dry roasting the nuts to meet the 

HCS requirements. We strongly encourage our 

customers to try these healthy snacks of great 

source of nutrients and antioxidants.





high-risk food categories - baked good, snacks, 

ready meals and spreads make up the majority 

of packaged foods containing PHO. Sheng Siong 

recognises the Singapore government’s call to 

take action to eliminate the use of PHO in food and 

commits to the PHO-Free pledge by ensuring that 

our housebrand products across the four high-risk 

food categories are PHO-free by June 2020 — one 

year ahead of the effective date of the ban. We will 

continue relentlessly to work with our suppliers to 

expand the range and selection of healthier choice 

products.

Since 2017, we partnered the HPB in the “Eat, Drink, 

Shop Healthy Challenge” to encourage consumers 

to make healthier choices during their daily grocery 

shopping. For every HCS product purchased, 

customers can scan the QR code generated on 

their receipts to be awarded Healthpoints. These 

Healthpoints can be used to redeem grocery 

shopping vouchers. In 2019, we continued to support 

the initiative.

FRESH AND SAFE

Maintenance of the cold chain is important for 

preserving the safety, freshness, shelf life and 

quality (including nutritional value and sensory 

characteristics) of fresh produce while reducing 

wastage from spoilage throughout the supply 

chain. We adopted Cold Chain Management in the 

storage and handling of our fresh produce in 2011. 

This covers major supply chain links including 

transportation, distribution as well as storage at 

our logistics centre and retail outlets. In addition, 

we have attained ISO 22000:2005 Food Safety 

Management System certification since 2016 for our 

processing facility where we process seafood, meat 

and vegetables and repackaged dried food, frozen 

food and fruits. At our stores, an internal grading 

system has been put in place to check and improve 

hygiene and cleanliness. 

As part of our Quality Assurance Programme, we 

have a self-test programme to check and review 

products that are prone to food safety issues. We 

send samples of products and fresh produce from 

our logistics centre regularly to an external lab 

to test microbial, chemical and pesticide residue 

levels.

NON-COMPLIANCE

In 2019, we had six incidents relating to food safety, all of which were raised by the authorities. Whenever such 

incidents arise, our suppliers are immediately informed, and the products recalled and disposed of. We received 

four warnings and two non-significant monetary fines*. We have since taken actions to prevent such lapses.

We received two warnings for non-compliance concerning product and service information and labelling. There 

have been no cases of non-compliance concerning marketing communications that have resulted in a fine,

*Significant monetary fines are defined as being greater than $1,000 per incident.

RESPECTING CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Every year, we run two seasons of our weekly “Sheng Siong Show” where customers can participate for prizes by 

submitting their receipts at our retail outlets. To protect the privacy of customer data, receipts which contain 

personal particulars of customers are shredded fortnightly.

Sheng Siong complies with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) which governs the collection, use and 

disclosure of personal data which has taken effect since 2014. Our IT policy comprises of regular risk assessment 

that allows us to monitor and establish safeguards within our systems to prevent breaches. In 2019, there were 

zero substantiated complaints received concerning breaches of customer privacy or loss of customers’ data.

EMBRACING DIVERSITY

Sheng Siong’s flat corporate hierarchy fosters close, transparent and direct communication between employees 

and high-level management. We are family-friendly, approachable and have an open-door work environment.

Our whistleblowing policy offers a channel for our employees to raise sensitive issues without the fear of 

retaliation. Proper procedures have been established to address complaints with regards to abusive, fraudulent, 

unethical behaviour and misconduct of our employees.

We have encountered zero cases of incidents relating to discrimination.



“I decided to return to the workforce when my kids got 

older. There was a recruitment advertisement at the store 

and I called in. The first thing I asked was if the position was 

opened to non-Chinese. The HR manager told me candidly 

that the company hires people regardless of race. Since 

then, it has been my 6th year in Sheng Siong. I am very 

happy here and my co-workers respect me and are friendly 

to me. Language has never been a problem, I learnt some 

Malay in my younger days and I picked up some simple 

Mandarin on the job from my customers and colleagues.”

STAFF TRAINING



“I participated in the ‘train the trainers’ programme at 

ITE, where we develop the training standards for all 

the departments. Although I am with procurement, 

but the training has allowed everyone to have a better 

understanding of the other departments. For the 

continuity of the business, it is very important that 

we do the curriculum well so that when anyone leaves 

the company, institutional knowledge is preserved for 

the newcomer. Also, different trainers can assess the 

performance of the newcomers based on a standard set 

Miss Seow Wen Yi (28, Assistant Manager, Purchasing) 



of training requirements. With an effective set of training manuals, it is easier to pick up the required 

skills, and our colleagues can be more cross-functional.” 

At Sheng Siong, new employees are welcomed 

into the company through a one-day orientation 

programme. We place a strong emphasis on 

on-the-job training as we believe it assimilates 

a new employee into his or her job’s role and 

responsibilities more easily. 

Since 2018 and well into 2019, the rapid expansion 

of the Group coupled with the tightening of foreign 

labour policy has resulted in a manpower strain. It 

was challenging to send our employees for formal 

training continuously without having a drastic 

impact on our business functions. However, Sheng 

Siong remains committed to the training and skills 

upgrading of our staff. There is a strong emphasis 

for on-the-job training due to the nature of our 

business, and we believe that this will remain the 

foundation of our training method as learning 

through role modelling and from experience is 

fundamental to our operational effectiveness. 

We assess the skills and performance of our 

employees on a regular basis, and are quick to 

share learning points across our communication 

channels with all employees. Daily staff briefings 

and monthly meetings with store managers and 

head of departments are also opportunities to 

deliver bite-sized trainings.

We have decided to set up a more structured 

approach to our training and are currently exploring 

the adoption of on-the-go e-learning as a training 

platform to deliver bite-sized trainings that can 

be more accessible and receptive among our 

employees. In 2019, to prepare for the completion 

of our training supermarket as part of the new 

extension of our HQ and distribution centre, we 

embarked on a ‘train the trainers’ programme with 

our partner, ITE College Central. The specially 

tailored program saw our core team of trainers 

developing 

structured 

training 

curriculum, 

materials, delivery and assessment methodologies. 

The set-up of the training supermarket is expected 

to be completed by early 2021.

WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH

Our 

Workplace 

Safety 

and 

Health 

(WSH) 

management system is developed based on the 

result of our risk assessment and covers all our 

employees, business activities and locations of our 

business operations. The last risk assessment was 

conducted in 2019. Our WSH policies comply with 

the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Act. As 

part of compliance, the Group is required to set up 

a Workplace Safety and Health Committee. We also 

abide by the Fire Safety Act and have developed an 

Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and established a 

Company Emergency Response Team (CERT).

100% of our workforce is represented by two joint 

management-worker WSH Committees – one for our 

warehousing and distribution centre, and the other 

for our stores. The committees report to the Risk 

Management and Business Continuity Committee 

that is chaired by the Executive Director.

Each WSH Committee:

• Meets on a monthly basis to discuss matters 

related to WSH and fire safety.

• Conducts monthly workplace inspections and 

provide reports documenting the observations 

and recommendations on remedial actions 

required.

• Investigates and reports on accidents and 

recommend actions to be taken.

• Promotes WSH among colleagues.

• Collects feedback on WSH related issues from 

employees.

• Conducts regular WSH related training and staff 

briefings.

We have been working with a professional WSH 

consultant since 2015 to advise us on our Group’s 

WSH related issues. Regular review meetings are 

also conducted with our insurance brokerage firm 

which also provides advice on risk management.

The most common causes of our workplace injuries 

include:

• Cut or laceration – 29.0%

• Hit by objects – 18.6%

• Over-exertions – 17.7%

• Slipped, tripped, fell – 14.7%

In 2019

Although we have not reduced the number of 

workplace 

accidents 

significantly, 

improving 

workplace safety measures such as making it 

mandatory to wear anti-cut gloves, safety-shoes, 

and ergonomic coaching on heavy-lifting, have 

resulted in the reduction of the severity of the 

accidents that have taken place. There has been no 

case of fatality.

Our employees are encouraged to report on 

potential WSH hazards and may report these 

anonymously through our feedback box. Our 

whistleblowing procedure allows our employees 

to raise their concerns in confidence and remain 

protected against reprisals.

Our sub-contractors make up less than 0.5% of our 

workforce and are required to comply with our WSH 

policies. Their management is given direct access 

to provide feedback to our Group’s management. 

Sheng Siong has not gone on to manage our 

suppliers’ responsibilities towards their employees’ 

safety and health. This information is currently 

unavailable. We shall continue to explore how the 

Group can play a positive role in fostering workplace 

safety and health along the supply chain.

NON-COMPLIANCE

In 2019, the Group received three warnings and 

one non-significant monetary fine*. Gaps were 

immediately identified in our risk management on 

the use of certain equipment and our safe work 

procedures. Affected employees were also briefed 

again on the safety procedures. Such lessons are 

also shared during staff briefings with the greater 

group of employees, and everyone are strongly 

reminded to follow established safety procedures.

WORKPLACE SAFETY TRAINING &amp; EDUCATION

Every year, we conduct two refresher training 

sessions on the use of forklifts and electronic power 

jacks at our distribution centre. We will continually 

provide training in:

• First Aid

• Fire Safety

• Emergency Response

A group sharing channel has also been established 

to send regular safety reminders, to promote 

learning from accidents that have occurred within 

the Group, and sharing of best safety practices.

PROVIDING MORE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

We partner government agencies and NGOs to 

promote workplace health and safety. From 2014 to 

2018, we partnered the Singapore Health Promotion 

Board (HPB) to roll out impactful targeted 

interventions for retail workers at our outlets and 

employees working in back-of-house support. The 

workplace health promotion programme consisted 

of health screening, health and ergonomic coaching 

and enhancement of our company’s meals by 

adopting less oil, less salt and less sugar in our 

food preparation. Our efforts have been recognised 

by the HPB when we were conferred the HEALTH 

AWARD 2019 – Special Mention Award. Towards the 

end of 2019, we further collaborated with HPB to 

organise weekly Kickboxing Fitness Classes for our 

employees at our HQ Office.

We offer medical benefits by reimbursing our employees for medical consultation fees charged by government 

polyclinics or hospitals. Employees who face financial difficulties and challenging medical conditions may also 

apply to us for financial assistance.

Every year, our founders also distribute healthcare equipment such as electronic toothbrushes and massage pads 

to our employees to promote preventive care and healthy living.

CARE FOR EMPLOYEES 

To ease the rising cost of living and encourage our employees to eat more healthily, we introduced in 2017 a 

staff purchase scheme for groceries and fresh produce at our stores. Last year, the scheme paid out more than 

$382,000 in benefits, an increase of 23% as compared to 2018.

Other employee benefits that promote work-life balance and a pro-family culture include:

• Annual family day

• Family care leave

• Marriage leave and a congratulatory gift are given to eligible staff to prepare for their wedding or honeymoon.

• A newborn care package is presented to female employees and the wives of our male employees who have 

given birth.

• Bereavement contributions to employees for the loss of their loved ones.

• Flexi-work arrangements were introduced back in 2015. Our employees are allowed to take half-day leave. We 

also provide them with flexibility in work-time arrangements as required.

A record-breaking number of 46 employees received their long service award for 20 years of service to the Group.

CARE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES 

A RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER





“As I am deskbound in the office most of the 

time, it is great to have the chance to work 

out at the workplace. It helps me to clock 

some workout time which gets pushed to 

the backburner. The kickboxing fitness 

class is well-suited for people across all 

fitness levels and our instructors have been 

very meticulous. When our instructor saw 

that we are not keeping up, she will slow 

down the class for everyone to catch up. 

It is more than burning the extra calories, I 

have also enjoyed the bonding time with my 

colleagues.”

“When I was 19 years old, I borrowed $200 from my 

mother and came to Singapore to find a job. But it 

took me some time and I was left with only 20 cents 

in my pocket when I finally found a job as a stacker in 

Sheng Siong. Luckily, the company provided meals and 

I managed to sustain till the first pay check. Since then, 

I have been with Sheng Siong for two decades, rising 

through the ranks from a stacker, store manager to a 

senior manager. 

Back in school, I was quite resistant to the idea of 

working in a supermarket, as I thought it was not 

a real skillset. But I have learnt how to work with 

people, manage a store, and now I am responsible for 

warehouse operations .”

GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY

It is our policy to give back to the local communities 

where we operate, by supporting our employees and 

their family as well as contributing to community 

initiatives organised by NGOs, educational institutions 

and our suppliers.

The Group contributed a total of $168,312 to 

community initiatives in 2019. This may not seem like 

a significant amount, but we believe that charitable 

contributions should go beyond the monetary form. 

Therefore, when it comes to giving back to the 

community, Sheng Siong’s focus has consistently 

been a contribution of in-kind resources such as 

space, time, effort and labour.

The supermarket is a space where the community 

congregates and we believe that we have an important 

role to play in promoting the community spirit, racial 

harmony and neighbourliness, as well as supporting 

conversations that matter to our community and the 

environment.

We also supported initiatives in 2019 such as:

• NEA’s Food waste reduction campaign

• NEA’s Say ‘YES’ to Waste Less campaign

• Zero Waste SG’s Bring-Your-Own campaign

• J.O.E’s Plastic Reduction campaign

• Red Cross Project R.I.C.E 2019

• Switch&amp;Save – Use LED (SSUL) Campaign

• Heartwarmers Volunteer Group

HEARTWARMERS VOLUNTEER GROUP

In 2019, we continued to partner with Heartwarmers Volunteer Group to build and expand the ground-up initiative 

called “Project 100=50”. This was the third year we participated in the project, which was originally a collaboration 

between multiple parties, including Henderson-Dawson CCC, Nee Soon Central Grassroots Organisations and 

Sree Narayana Mission Home, and has since expanded to include Tampines North CCC, Kembangan-Chai Chee 

Social Team and Jurong Spring CCC. Project 100=50 allows selected beneficiaries to purchase items at a 50% 

discount, up to a maximum discount of $50. These invited beneficiaries typically belong to lower middle-income 

families who require some form of financial help. The programme had helped these beneficiaries save money 

when buying groceries through discounted prices. Sheng Siong had supported 53 such events throughout 2019 

by setting up booths, providing shopping trolleys, baskets, fridges and shopping bags. Our colleagues from the 

Housebrand Department have also volunteered their services, contributing about 742 volunteer hours at these 

events.

Our approach to community contribution and philanthropic activities are in line with our core mission of value 

creation for our stakeholders.











HELPING WITH RISING COST OF LIVING

While Sheng Siong strives to keep essential products 

affordable, we also believe in extending a helping 

hand to vulnerable groups in the community. In 2019, 

we extended our special 3% senior citizen discount 

programme for another year. To show our support 

and appreciation towards the Merdeka Generation 

for their contribution towards the development 

of Singapore in the early years, we launched the 

Merdeka Generation discount programme, by offering 

this group of seniors another 3% discount on every 

Tuesday of the week. The total discount provided 

under the two programmes was about S$1.5 million 

in 2019. We also work closely with community centres 

to organise trips for senior citizens to watch the live 

telecast of the Sheng Siong Show at Mediacorp which 

could be a privilege for some.

EDUCATION GRANTS FOR LOWER-SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ CHILDREN

The children of our lower-salaried employees are entitled to receive an education grant. The Annual Education 

Grant which was incepted in 2013 is fully paid for by the three founders of the Group, who are also major 

shareholders.

Last year, we disbursed a total amount of $464,800 to 558 children of our lower-salaried employees. The three 

founders are committed to supporting the philanthropic activities of the Group and have contributed to causes 

such as the President’s Challenge 2019, Chinese Development Assistance Council, SPD, and Blossom Seeds 

Limited.

A MORE VIBRANT SINGAPORE

Singapore imports more than 90% of our food 

sources. To remain competitive and create greater 

value for our shoppers, our Group has adopted a direct 

sourcing strategy over the years, especially for our 

fresh food category. This has not only shortened the 

supply chain and improved savings but also helped us 

to have better oversight on food quality, food safety 

and food security issues. Sheng Siong also practises 

diversification in sourcing to keep supplies of our 

products stable and affordable throughout the year 

and in times of crisis. We work with about 1,000 

suppliers in our supply chain, where 84% of them are 

locally-registered companies and represent about 

93% of our total purchases. We support our locally-

registered suppliers by improving communications 

and business administration procedures through our 

suppliers’ portal and bulk handling of their products.

SUPPORTING LOCAL FARMS

During the 2019 Budget, the Singapore government 

announced a target to produce 30% of Singapore’s 

nutritional needs locally by 2030 in a bid to strengthen 

food security amidst increasing threats from climate 

change. We continue to support local vegetable 

farmers such as Quan Fa Organic Farm (全发有机农业), 

Yili Vegetation &amp; Trading Pte Ltd, and local egg farms 

such as N&amp;N Agriculture. We hope that the presence 

of local produce at Sheng Siong’s mass market 

distribution channels will encourage venture capital 

interest for the support of farms in Singapore, and we 

hope to help local farmers build a strong brand of safe, 

quality, and affordable locally-produced vegetables, 

with increased demand from our customers.

CREATING JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINDS’ 

TRAINEES

Since 2014, we have collaborated with the Movement 

for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDs) 

through their enclave work model. We host 10 MINDs 

beneficiaries to work at our vegetable packing 

department. They work alongside our staff, dine 

with us for lunch at our canteen, and are invited to 

our company’s annual family day event to socialise 

with our employees. 2019 marks the 5th year of our 

collaboration.





“Finances are tight as I have 5 children to bring up. My eldest 

is 15 years old, while my youngest is 5 years old. My four older 

kids have been receiving the education grant since I joined the 

company two years ago. The grant has been of great help to 

my family as it gets the kids ready for school. We replace their 

worn out school bags and buy schoolbooks for the new school 

year. Imagine having to buy new shoes three times a year as 

they worn out their school shoes very quickly. We are definitely 

thankful for the company’s benefits. Besides the education 

“I did a 3-month stint at Sheng Siong’s 

head office for my final year internship as 

a ITE student in “Games Art and Design”. 

Initially, I thought there would be nothing 

much for me to learn as my course was 

about making games. But I put to use the 

Photoshop and video-editing skills learnt 

in school to design graphics for posters, 

photo-taking and video-editing. My time 

there has greatly improved my Photoshop 

and drawing skills. I also learnt to plan my 

work to meet deadlines and be organised 

in the things I do. My colleagues were very 

friendly and they were always offering me 

food and drinks!”

SUSTAINABLE SOURCING

We are committed to promoting sustainability along our value chain and intend to enhance our purchasing policies

Sheng Siong has supported our business in many ways. We are always able to discuss and plan our

To play our part in promoting the quality of life in the heartlands, we worked with town councils to restrict delivery 

times by food suppliers to mitigate noise disturbance in the HDB neighbourhoods. Special delivery arrangements 

are made to ensure deliveries to the stores are carried out at appropriate timings, and extreme care is taken 

during loading and unloading with noise-reducing equipment such as noise-absorbing pallet jacks to mitigate the 

disturbance. In 2019, a total of 12 instances of feedback were received on noise disturbances.

CLEAN NEIGHBOURHOODS

We play our part in contributing to the cleanliness of the community we operate in. Pest control programmes are

LET’S FIGHT SCAMS

Singapore reported a significant increase in scams 

cases in 20191. The top ten2 scams including social 

media impersonation scams and lucky draw scams, 

which constituted almost 95% of all scam cases 

reported.  Sheng Siong also observed more incidents 

of such scams where our brand is used purportedly 

to phish for netizens’ personal information or for 

their money. Since 2018, we have collaborated with 

the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to 

provide anti-scam and crime prevention training 

for staff. Posters were placed at all outlets to alert 

customers on the latest scams. Incidents are 

reported to the Singapore Computer Emergency 

Response Team (SingCERT), the Cyber Security 

Agency of Singapore, as they come to our knowledge. 

In addition, we update our social media sites on a 

timely basis to inform netizens of circulating scams, 

and encourage the public to only trust information 

from our official website and social media accounts.

Conserving Resources






CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 

CONSERVING RESOURCES

In 2016, Singapore joined 170 other countries in signing the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. The 

Sustainable Singapore Blueprint was developed to guide our nation towards the goal of building a more liveable 

and sustainable Singapore. In 2019, our government announced the adoption of circular economy strategies 

towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation, and launched the nationwide ‘Say Yes to Waste Less’ Campaign which 

Sheng Siong supported and participated in. The mandatory waste reporting regulation will also be extended to 

large industrial developments like our distribution centre in 2020.

Sheng Siong recognises its responsibility to contribute towards the goal of becoming a Zero Waste Nation, and 

has viewed the conservation of resources as a key business objective. We adopt the 3Rs ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ 

principle in the management of our resources and waste. We monitor and measure the usage of our resources and 

waste streams because we believe that through conserving precious resources, we not only contribute to a more 

sustainable environment but also lower our cost and create value for our stakeholders. 

Improving Energy Efficiency

Our distribution centre has been awarded the BCA Green Mark Compliance for 100% use of LED lights, a cold 

storage heat recovery system, and its rainwater recovery system. 

The completion of our distribution centre in 2011 enabled us to improve our capacity and ability in the bulk 

handling of products for our suppliers by switching from a direct store delivery model to a centralised distribution 

model. We successfully reduced the number of trips our suppliers have to make to deliver to our stores - from 

50-60 deliveries per day per store in the past, to 5-6 deliveries per day directly from our distribution centre today. 

This enabled us to reduce our carbon footprint associated with the transportation of goods. Our warehouse is 

equipped with efficient inventory and distribution management systems that allow us to exercise better control 

over our logistics operations.

Sheng Siong owns a fleet of 75 delivery vehicles. Since 1 January 2018, the National Environment Agency (NEA) 

requires all new diesel vehicles to meet the Euro VI emission standard. Our fleet replacement policy is to choose 

vehicles with engineering solutions that adhere to the latest emission standards.

All our 59 stores have been fitted with LED lights. LED bulbs are the most efficient lighting choice, using only a 

third of the energy of fluorescent lights and potentially reducing the energy consumption of our lights by up to 

80%.

REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT

Using Solar Energy

To reduce our carbon footprint and our electricity 

consumption from the grid, a major photovoltaic system 

was installed in 2013 on the rooftop of our Mandai Link 

Distribution Centre. The panels occupy an area of about 

11,000 square metres, making full use of its available 

roof area. Upon commissioning in 2014, the installation 

was the largest single photovoltaic system in Singapore 

with a capacity of 1,200 kWp (kilowatt-peak). Our 

proactive effort to be environmentally friendly was 

recognised and it led the Group to become a recipient 

of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) 

Solar Pioneer Award. In 2019, our PV (Solar) system 

supplied about 11.8% of our total energy usage at our 

distribution centre.

Driving Behavioural Change Among Our Employees

We have been collaborating with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Singapore Green Building 

Council (SGBC) since 2018 to develop a framework to drive behavioural change among our staff and customers 

towards environmental protection. 

In 2018, we piloted a programme to drive energy consumption change in our store operations. In 2019, we adapted 

the framework to encourage our employees who work in the offices to turn off their computer monitors when not 

in use, and increase the temperature of their air-conditioners to at least 23°C. As a result, we saw 29.3% more 

staff switch off monitors after work and 20% more staff increase the temperature of their air-conditioners.

The framework encourages us to self-reflect and investigate our everyday behaviour for opportunities to improve. 

The bottom-up approach is also practical and invokes a sense of ownership among our stakeholders.

MANAGING FOOD WASTE

In 2019, close to 744 million kilograms of food waste1 was generated in Singapore. This is a big problem for land 

scarce Singapore because our only landfill will soon run out of space. In addition, when we waste food, it is not just 

the food that is thrown out, but also the resources and effort devoted to nurturing, delivering and marketing it.

We are gravely concerned about the need to reduce and manage food waste and believe that we need to do it right 

from the start. We have put in place sound purchasing and inventory management policies, excellent storage 

and food handling standards and systems, and adopted state-of-the-art packaging and processing techniques to 

prolong the shelf life of our products and produce.

We have participated in Food Waste Reduction Campaigns headed by the National Environmental Agency (NEA). 

This includes putting up posters and signage in our stores to raise awareness and educate consumers to handle 

our fresh produce with care, to shop wisely and adopt good storage practices at home, so as not to waste food.

“Reduced to Clear” sections have also been introduced since 2011, where fresh produce that is slightly blemished 

but still wholesome, or that are close to expiry are sold at reduced prices.

RECYCLING AND REDUCING OUR WASTE

We partner a handful of our suppliers to reuse plastic crates for the supply of our fresh vegetables, fruits, seafood 

and eggs. Styrofoam boxes that are typically used by suppliers to supply temperature-sensitive products are also 

washed, sanitised and reused internally. Excess styrofoam boxes are collected to be recycled.

We sort our waste conscientiously for recycling. A paper-compacting machine is used to compact carton boxes 

(collected from the stores) into cubes to reduce the space required for delivery to the recycling plant. We also 

recycle food waste, plastic, wooden pallets, stretched film, styrofoam boxes, cans and metals.

Since 2017, we have been collaborating with NEA 

on a food waste co-digestion project, where 

source-segregated food waste collected from 13 

of our stores and distribution centre is sent daily 

to a facility at Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation 

Plant for co-digestion with used water sludge 

. This co-digestion process yields more biogas 

from the anaerobic digestion process compared 

to the treatment of used water sludge alone, 

thereby enhancing energy recovery. By 2019, the 

project was extended to all 59 stores including our 

distribution centre, and an estimated 3,035 tonnes 

of food waste generated was successfully diverted.

Reducing Packaging Waste

The excessive usage and disposal of plastics continues to be one of the most concerning environmental problems 

today. The debate continues regarding the best way to address this problem, from incentivising bringing-your-

own bags to imposing a plastic bag charge. There is also ongoing debate on whether reusable bags are more 

harmful to the environment if they are not reused enough times1, or if disposables made from paper or other 

biodegradable materials are indeed better for the environment2.

There is no straightforward solution to this complex problem which has been perpetuated by our over-reliance on 

usage of plastic disposables for convenience and economic development. However, the message is clear – there 

needs to be a concerted effort with every stakeholder doing what is within their means to reduce our dependency 

on plastics.

Sheng Siong has been a signatory to the Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA) since 2018. In 2019, we were 

conferred the Excellence Award (Multinational Company and Local Large Enterprise Category) by SPA for our 

exemplary efforts in reducing packaging waste. Some of the initiatives we have continued to implement include:

• Reviewing packaging of our housebrand products: Packaging used for our housebrand products falls within 

the “Lightest” to “Median” range of the Packaging Benchmarking Database developed by the SPA, where 

information about the packaging of the product is available.

• Making a conscientious effort in the design and choice of packaging when developing new housebrand 

products.

• Working with suppliers to replace styrofoam packing with alternative materials such as paper cartons 

wherever possible without compromising on the freshness and quality of our fresh food products.

• Collaborating with partners to continue raising awareness on the need to reduce plastic usage, and actions 

that every shopper can take.

In 2019, we successfully reduced the use of pallet stretch film by 22.5% compared to 2018 by switching to one 

of a different material specification. Pallet stretch film is used for wrapping and securing bulk cargo during 

transportation.

Waste Disposal

The company does not produce any hazardous waste. Our waste is directly disposed of by the company, except for 

general waste from the supermarkets that are collected by the public waste management companies.

MANAGING OUR WATER USAGE

Water is a scarce resource in Singapore. Our water at the distribution centre and retail outlets are supplied by 

the public utility company and is used mainly for general cleaning, food processing, and meal preparation. We are 

committed to reducing our water usage, by implementing initiatives such as the new rainwater recovery system 

in our distribution centre which allows us to use recovered rainwater for toilets, general washing and gardening 

on the distribution centre’s premises.

Sheng Siong complies with the NEA’s Environmental Protection and Management (Trade Effluent) Regulations 

which regulates the quality of trade effluent discharge in Singapore.

Water Use2 (m3)

Some 

shoppers 

in 

Singapore 

have 

become 

increasingly concerned about the excessive use 

of plastic bags, while some remain indifferent. We 

recognise our ability to positively influence the 

choices made by our consumers and suppliers. We 

have taken a more proactive stance to campaign 

for a reduction in the use of plastic bags among 

our shoppers and will continue to review our 

operational procedures on the bagging of products 

at the checkout counters and weighing stations. We 

estimate that we have reduced the rate of usage of 

plastic bags by about 6.5% as compared to 2018, and 

we are grateful to our shoppers who have made the 

difference.

To date, we continue to sell some basic food 

ingredients like potatoes, onions, and ginger on 

loose display, without the use of packaging. However, 

certain fresh produce is still better sold pre-packed 

as we consider factors such as hygiene, preservation 

of freshness and shelf life, and potential food wastage 





Our adoption of a newer assisted pallet wrapping system with a handheld tool (right) has enabled us to optimise our 

stretch film use and reduce our staff’s workload.

caused by inappropriate handling by consumers. 

This is because the supermarket is air-conditioned 

which causes fresh fruits and vegetables to lose 

moisture more easily. Hence, moderate packaging 

can retain the moisture content in fresh produce 

and prevent cross-contamination. That said, we 

continue to work closely with our suppliers to avoid 

unnecessary packaging or use environmentally-

friendly materials while keeping food competitively 

priced and affordable.

The mandatory reporting framework for packaging 

will be imposed by 2020. To prepare for this new 

compliance requirement, we have taken steps to 

improve our data collection system. We hope that 

this new set of data will help us to chart a clearer 

path to managing our packaging waste.
