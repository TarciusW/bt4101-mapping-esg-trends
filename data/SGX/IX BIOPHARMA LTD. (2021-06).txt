Sustainability Board Statement  

GRI 102-14  

 

iX Biopharma is pleased to publish this FY2021 Sustainability Report. It captures our initiatives to integrate sustainability across our organisation in the areas of environment, social and governance (ESG).  

 

Sustainability is integral in order for our business to achieve lasting commercial success. We have embarked on this sustainability journey by looking at our responsibility for the environment we are operating 

in, people in our workforce and innovative products for the healthcare industry. 

 

Environment 

We are fully committed to our 

environmental initiatives along our 

entire value chain, from product 

development to supply of goods. 

We have identified energy as one of 

the material topics and will 

continue to identify other areas of 

improvement where we can 

mitigate our environmental impact. 

 

People  

We value our employees as the key 

pillar for our long-term success. As 

an equal opportunity employer, we 

aspire to be the workplace of choice 

for our staff. We strongly believe in 

diversity and being inclusive with 

regard to hiring policies. We employ 

the best talent, without 

discrimination on race, gender or 

age.  

 

We also value the importance of 

competency and proficiency in our 

workforce to ensure the long-term 

success of our business. During 

FY2021, we continued to invest in 

the training and development of our 

employees to enhance their skills 

and capabilities. 

Innovation 

Innovation is the cornerstone of the 

Group and continues to be an 

important driver of future growth.

pharmacovigilance monitoring 

system to handle feedback and 

recall events. 

Governance  

Corporate governance is at the 

centre of our business in achieving 

our sustainability goals. We uphold 

the belief that good corporate 

governance practices are essential 

in building a sound corporation with 

an ethical environment, thereby

 About iX Biopharma 

GRI 102-2|102-3|102-4|102-5|102-6|102-7|102-8 

 

 

iX Biopharma is listed on the Singapore Exchange and is a limited 

liability company.  Our corporate office is in Singapore and we have 

operations in Australia and China.  

iX 

Biopharma 

is 

focused 

on 

the 

development 

and 

commercialisation of therapies for diseases of the central nervous 

system using novel, patent protected formulations for sublingual 

delivery. iX Biopharma has developed a patented drug delivery 

platform technology, WaferiX. WaferiX delivers drug sublingually 

via the mucosa for better absorption, faster onset of action and 

predictable effect. The WaferiX delivery platform is particularly 

useful for drug repurposing. Drug repurposing is where existing 

approved drugs are developed into new drugs targeting different 

indications or a different route of administration, at a lower 

development cost and risk.  

iX Biopharma’s pipeline of products under development includes 

Wafermine (ketamine wafer) and BnoX (buprenorphine wafer) for 

pain management. iX Biopharma’s drugs for the treatment of 

erectile dysfunction, Wafesil, a sublingual sildenafil wafer, and 

Silcap, have been registered in Australia and Singapore. iX 

Biopharma has also developed Xativa, the world’s first freeze-dried 

sublingual medicinal cannabis wafer.  

Xativa is supplied in Australia under the Special Access Scheme and 

Authorised Prescriber pathways for the treatment of various 

conditions. During 2021, Xativa was included in the Australian 

Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) list of drugs approved for 

export from Australia. 

The Group’s nutraceuticals division, Entity Health, is engaged in the 

development and commercialisation of nutraceutical products that 

address specific conditions and improve quality of lifestyles 

throughout all phases of life. It distributes its Entity line of 

nutraceutical products in Australia through more than 250 

pharmacies and health food shops, in China through its flagship 

stores on Tmall Global and JD Worldwide, and globally through its 

online store. 

Our manufacturing facility in Australia is licensed by the 

Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, complies with 

Good Manufacturing Practice, and supplies therapeutic products to 

hospitals and registered pharmacies. In 2021, we have successfully 

commissioned our newly installed freeze-dryer and significantly 

increased our wafer production capacity by up to six times.

Sustainability at iX Biopharma 

GRI 102-11|102-18 

 

Sustainability is integral to iX Biopharma’s business to achieve the lasting commercial success of iX Biopharma. We have embarked on the sustainability journey by looking at our responsibility for the 

environment we are operating in, people in our workforce and innovative products for the healthcare industry. At iX Biopharma, we understand the importance of reducing our environmental impact and are 

committed to conducting business in a responsible manner by supporting the precautionary principle. 

 

 

Sustainability Governance  

GRI 102-18 

Corporate governance is at the heart of our efforts in achieving our 

sustainability goals. We uphold the belief that good corporate 

governance practices are essential in building a sound corporation 

with an ethical environment, thereby protecting the interests of all 

stakeholders. We strive to put in place a robust governance 

framework to maintain the integrity, transparency, accountability 

and discipline in all our practices. 

The Board provides guidance on the social, ethical and 

environmental impact of the Group’s activities and oversees the 

monitoring and management of material sustainability issues and 

their performance indicators.  We consider sustainability issues 

relating to the environment and social factors as part of the 

Group’s strategic plans.  The Management under the guidance of 

the Board is committed to integrating best sustainability practices 

into the Group’s working environment and business operation. 

Supply chain 

GRI 102-9 |102-10 

As we are accountable to our stakeholders, we endeavour to 

ensure that appropriate risk management, key internal controls 

and procedures are in place during the procurement of goods and 

services. 

As at end of FY2021, we have a pool of approximately 320 active 

suppliers, including contractors, clinical research organisations, 

professional consultants, and financial institutions which are 

mainly based in Singapore, Australia, China and USA. In the future, 

we aim to embed sustainability measures into our value chain and 

integrate 

environmental 

factors 

wherever 

possible 

and 

appropriate. 

As 

an 

essential 

business 

supplying 

pharmaceutical 

and 

nutraceutical products, we continue to operate our manufacturing 

plant during the global COVID-19 pandemic with sustainable and 

robust supply chains to ensure uninterrupted supply to our 

customers. 

Earlier in the year, we saw disruption to the supply chain and 

logistics resulting in some cases in higher costs and disrupted 

timelines.  However, the most significant impact of COVID-19 on 

our business was the delay in the installation and commissioning of 

our new freeze dry equipment due to border restrictions in 

Australia. This delayed our ability to drive new business and grow 

our wafer product portfolio due to production capacity limitations. 

Intermittent lockdowns in Australia affected instore retail sales for 

nutraceuticals and our ability to increase retail outlet stockists. It 

also affected our engagement with medical prescribers of 

medicinal cannabis for our Xativa product.  

Despite the challenges, we successfully commissioned our newly 

installed freeze-dryer in July 2021. This will significantly increase 

our wafer production capacity by up to six times.

Stakeholder Engagement 

GRI 102-40|102-42|102-43|102-44 

 

At iX Biopharma, we firmly believe in regularly engaging our 

stakeholders to understand the issues most important to them and 

our business impact. We have identified our key stakeholders 

based on importance, representation, dependency and proximity 

to our business. 

We are committed to integrating our stakeholders’ concerns in our 

business strategies and policies. Therefore, we continuously seek 

to explore effective communication channels and strengthen our 

relationships with them.  

This year, while the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact 

businesses and lives worldwide, compared with the previous year, 

businesses and various stakeholders are generally better prepared 

or have adopted ongoing measures to minimise the impact of the 

COVID-19 pandemic.   

This is consistent with the idea that over time, the disease will 

become endemic, and the world will have to learn to cope with a 

world where vaccinations, testing, safe distancing measures, mask-

wearing, etc are the norm.

Material ESG Factors and Targets 

GRI 102-46|102-47|103-1 

 

iX Biopharma has undertaken a detailed process to identify, prioritise and validate the environmental, social, governance and economic issues that matter most to our organisation. Our 2021 Sustainability 

Board Statement and peer research have also been referenced in this assessment.  

We conducted a materiality assessment workshop with our internal stakeholders. Where practicable, we would engage external stakeholders (as set out on the previous page) during materiality assessment.   

This was subsequently assessed for relevancy to both our stakeholders and the environmental, social and governance impact of our business operations. The following table sets out the material ESG Factors 

and targets for the coming year:

Economic 

Financial performance 

GRI 103-1|103-2|103-3|201-1|201-4 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our Company has been moving from a focus on development of 

new products to commercialisation over the past few years, as 

such, we have revised our material ESG Factor to focus on 

traditional financial performance indicators such as sales, profit / 

loss, operating cashflow. 

We have increased our sales in FY2021 by 77% when compared 

with FY2020.  As announced on 2 June 2021, we have installed new 

freeze-dry equipment and this is expected to contribute positively 

to our sales in the coming years. 

Our approach to managing  

Key economic events and achievements in FY2021 were reviewed 

by the Chairman &amp; CEO in his statement included in our Annual 

Report 2021 from pages 3 to 7. Detailed discussions on our 

operations, business strategy and financial performance can be 

found on pages 10 to 17 of Annual Report 2021. 

 

 

 

Environment 

Energy 

GRI 103-1|103-2|103-3|302-1|302-3 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We are aware of our responsibility towards the environment. Our 

choice of efficient and clean sources of energy has the potential to 

minimise the impact of our operations to the environment. As 

climate change continues to be one of the most pressing global 

issues, it is our duty as responsible corporate citizens to do what 

we can towards the global agenda of protecting our planet.  

Uninterrupted and reliable electricity supply is critical to our wafer 

freeze-drying process. As we transition from a R&amp;D centric 

organisation to a business that includes manufacturing and supply, 

we expect our environmental footprint to increase accordingly.  

Our approach to managing  

In our daily operations, electricity, which is used to power our 

office buildings, manufacturing plant and laboratory, contributes 

to the majority of our energy consumption. We use fuel for our 

backup generators; however, the consumption is negligible.  

 

 

In this report, we have started presenting our internal energy 

consumption not only in terms of total energy consumed but also 

intensity of our consumption for each dollar of revenue generated.  

Commencing FY2020, we replaced traditional lighting with energy 

saving LED lighting progressively. We have since replaced all 

carpark areas, walkways and signages, which represented 

approximately 20% of total lightings in our Croydon plant and will 

continue progressively until the completion of this replacement 

program.  

Mindful of increasing electricity consumption as we step up our 

commercial manufacturing activities, we are evaluating the 

feasibility of an on-site solar power generation to supplement our 

electricity supply from the grid at our Croydon plant, Australia.

Social 

Customer Health and Safety  

GRI 103-1|103-2|103-3|416-1|416-2 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our aim at iX Biopharma is to develop products of the highest 

safety and quality standards. 

One of our top priorities is the safety and wellbeing of our 

customers. To ensure the quality and safety of our products, we 

have integrated quality standards, procedures and monitoring 

systems across our operations. All our products are continuously 

assessed for health and safety impacts across our value chain. 

Our approach to managing  

As a pharmaceutical company, we comply with all relevant and 

material regulations and applicable industrial standards. We have 

incorporated procedures throughout the manufacturing process 

from raw materials sourcing to rigorous product testing. 

We have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure that all 

materials used meet the necessary specification for all products. 

Some products undergo clinical trials, where the safety and 

efficacy aspects are assessed. We have also invested in the 

implementation of a pharmacovigilance monitoring system to 

handle feedbacks and recall events. We have in place an adverse 

effect events management programme. 

 

We adhere strictly to government regulations such as Therapeutic 

Goods Regulations 1990 of Australia, PIC/S Guide to Good 

Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products, Australian Code of 

Good Manufacturing Practice for Veterinary Medicines, and 

Therapeutics Advertising Code. This is made possible by having a 

robust Quality System that is focused on on-going monitoring.  Our 

Quality Assurance team constantly reviews our procedures, 

processes and quality of our products to ensure quality and 

compliance. 

To-date, two of our pharmaceutical products for erectile 

dysfunction are registered with the TGA, and one of which are also 

approved by Health Sciences Authority of Singapore for marketing 

in Singapore. In addition, all our nutraceutical products are listed 

on ARTG. 

As for our medicinal cannabis product range, our medical science 

liaison team has been actively engaging with doctors and the 

industry to educate and train them on this product range and the 

WaferiX 

sublingual 

technology. 

This 

communicates 

our 

competitive advantages, imparts scientific and clinical knowledge 

on our products, and through practical interaction, helps us to 

understand and meet the needs of the market.  

The Group, as one of six companies, is participating in a newly 

launched Cannabis Medicine Observation Study (CMOS) in 

Australia with Applied Cannabis Research. The study, the largest of 

its kind in Australia, aims to collect data from 20,000 patients 

nationwide within five years from medical centres, prescribing 

GP’s and specialists. We also participate in CA Clinics Observational 

Study (CACOS) by CA Clinics network.  These studies will assess the 

safety and efficacy of medicinal cannabis products, from these 

participating companies, across a variety of medical conditions.  

As part of our commitment to our customer health and safety, we 

strive to maintain:  

• 

zero cases of non-compliance with regulations and/or 

voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts 

of products 

• 

full assessment of health and safety impacts of all our 

products for improvement 

 



FY2021 and FY2020 

 

No case of non-compliance with regulations and/or 

voluntary codes concerning the health and safety 

impacts of products 

 

All products (pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals) are 

tested prior to release and assessed for 

improvements 









The Phase 3 studies will use the same pain models and primary 

endpoint that was successfully evaluated in Wafermine’s 

Phase 2b clinical study. This gives us great confidence in being 

able to reproduce the positive Phase 2b study results in the 

Phase 3 studies.

Social 

Training and Workplace Diversity 

GRI 103-1|103-2|103-3|404-1|405-1 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We value our employees as the key pillar for our long-term success. 

As an equal opportunity employer, we aspire to be the workplace 

of choice for our staff. We strongly believe in being inclusive with 

regard to hiring policies.  

We recognise that our employees are instrumental in the success 

and growth of our Group, and we are dependent on the quality and 

skill of our employees to resolve issues raised by our customers. 

Our approach to managing  

We employ the best talent, without discrimination on the basis of 

race, gender or age. We have policies and practices in place to 

ensure fair hiring and equal opportunity.  

Diversity is an integral part of engaging with the communities we 

work in.  In addition, merit and competency of employees are also 

key factors for the success of our business. We have in place 

multiple training manuals and systems for all our employees. 

The training systems ensure that all personnel are trained and 

deemed competent as required by their position description, 

assigned roles and responsibilities, and where a training gap exists, 

a plan is in place to close the gap. 

 

 

Safety, Health and Environment  

 GRI 103-1|103-2|103-3|403-2 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our employees are our most valuable asset. Therefore, our success 

depends upon ensuring a safe and conducive work environment 

for them. Our goal is to improve the work environment for our 

people by reducing risks, preventing occupational hazards and 

fostering their physical and psychological well-being. 

 

At our manufacturing facility, we work with active ingredients 

some of which may be highly potent. In case of lack of 

understanding and awareness, improper management of these 

substances in large volumes can be dangerous for our workers and 

their surroundings. 

The onset of the global pandemic has placed health and safety in 

the workplace as a central concern for all businesses. We recognise 

that we have a responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work 

environment for all our employees.  

Our approach to managing  

To ensure the safety of our employees we have put in place 

standard operating procedures.  

The Group operates a site-based approach to Safety, Health and 

Environment (SHE) to ensure that offices and facility operate to 

national recognised standards. These include complying with 

government regulations and commitments to continuous 

improvements to health &amp; safety of our workforce at a minimum 

impact to the environment.  

A site SHE committee, comprising personnel at our Croydon site, 

oversees the implementation of policies and work practices, and 

reviews all reportable incidents and actions being taken. They are 

responsible for reviewing all reported incidents, assessing the root 

cause, addressing safety gaps and ensuring that corrective as well 

as preventive measures are taken. 

The results of the incidents are reviewed during monthly 

management meeting and at the site with the SHE committee 

quarterly.   

During the year, no reportable incident has been recorded.

Innovation 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Innovation is the cornerstone of the Group and continues to be an 

important driver of future growth. WaferiX is a unique and 

versatile drug delivery platform that allows pharmacologically 

active compounds to disintegrate quickly under the tongue, 

reducing the effect of first-pass metabolism, and resulting in higher 

bioavailability, as compared to conventional methods of 

administration.  

At the date of this report, we hold patents for WaferiX in 5 

continents and all key markets including the United States, China, 

Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, 

Malaysia, and Indonesia, countries in the European Union and 

others. 

We have strong R&amp;D capability and collective experience in drug 

formulation, clinical pharmacology and drug delivery &amp; safety. Our 

R&amp;D activities are vital to our efforts to maintain our 

competitiveness in the industry as well as to further develop better 

and improved products.   

 

Our approach to managing  

We seek to identify areas of unmet or under-served therapeutic 

need and focus our research and development efforts on 

formulations of pharmaceuticals aimed at addressing such needs.  

Key to our approach is our drug repurposing strategy. We use 

WaferiX to repurpose and enhance various drugs, and where 

appropriate, register these drugs via the United States Food and 

Drug Administration (US FDA) 505(b)(2) pathway. 

Drug repurposing is where we use existing approved drugs to treat 

new therapeutic indications or develop into a new dosage form. By 

changing the dosage form and route of administration of an 

existing drug, we can increase the convenience of use, improve its 

therapeutic effect and side effect profile, expanding the drug’s 

effectiveness and suitability for use in a new therapeutic area.  

Wafermine is an example of a repurposed drug. It contains 

ketamine, an existing drug which is approved as an anaesthetic. We 

are repositioning the drug to treat acute moderate to severe pain.  

During the year, we explored other therapeutic areas, in addition 

to pain and urology (erectile dysfunction), that we can leverage 

with our WaferiX technology: 

▪ 

Psychiatry 

We have identified a drug candidate with the potential to 

address acute agitation and aggression in patients with 

dementia, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as well as manage 

alcohol withdrawal. Developed on our proprietary sublingual 

delivery platform, this drug was designed for faster speed of 

absorption with the potential to offer minimal side effects. 

 

▪ 

Vaccines 

The global pandemic has highlighted the need not only for 

effective vaccine development but also for the ability to 

distribute these vaccines rapidly and efficiently in times of crisis. 

The world is looking for more effective ways to administer and 

transport vaccines and this has put the spotlight on mucosal 

vaccine delivery. Mucosal vaccines have the potential benefit 

over conventional injections of eliciting an immune response in 

both mucosal and systemic tissue for protecting from viral 

invasion at mucosal surfaces. To provide a first line of 

protection at these entry ports, mucosal vaccines hold 

significant promise for reducing the burden of infectious 

diseases like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. A sublingual wafer 

vaccine offers the potential benefits of simpler logistics and 

storage, greatly improving the speed and extent of vaccine 

rollouts. The ability for people to self-administer the vaccine in

Oncology 

Cancer remains the leading cause of death worldwide, 

accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. Despite 

significant advances made in the treatment of cancer in recent 

years, some treatments are limited by their side effect profile, 

dosage form and administration route. We have identified 

approved oral small molecule cancer drugs which can be 

incorporated into the WaferiX matrix to produce a rapidly 

disintegrating sublingual wafer product. The aim for these 

products is to improve drug absorption and reduce the dose 

required, minimise side effects and provide an alternative 

dosage form for cancer patients who cannot swallow 

medication. 

 

Selected Products 

▪ 

Wafermine 

What it is: Sublingual ketamine wafer for the treatment of 

acute moderate to severe pain 

Active compound: Racemic ketamine 

Clinical development status: Concluded End-of-Phase-2 (EOP2) 

meeting with the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) at 

end of 2019 and reached an agreement with US FDA and 

European Medicines Agency on key aspects of pivotal Phase 3 

clinical trial programme.   

During FY2021, the US FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products 

granted the Company orphan drug designation for the 

treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) using 

ketamine.  

 

▪ 

Medicinal Cannabis 

Xativa, a sublingual cannabidiol (CBD) wafer  

Hypera, a sublingual tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) wafer 

Hytiva, a sublingual CBD:THC combination wafer 

Active compound: CBD and THC are the two prominent 

cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant 

Potential indications: Promising research suggests that CBD 

and THC may help with chronic pain, certain inflammatory and 

motor diseases, appetite, anxiety and inflammatory bowel 

disease, among others. 

 

Sublingual delivery of CBD and THC: Both CBD and THC are 

known to have poor oral bioavailability. As a result, taking 

cannabis sublingually has the benefits of a faster onset of action 

and higher bioavailability. WaferiX, being a validated sublingual 

wafer, provides a more elegant and convenient way to 

administer these cannabinoids, giving users a better 

experience. 

Clinical development status: Xativa is supplied through Special 

Access Scheme and Authorised Prescriber pathways in 

Australia. Xativa is currently prescribed by doctors for a wide 

variety of conditions including treating anxiety, relieving pain, 

reducing inflammation, and improving sleep quality, among 

other conditions, to patients who are not effectively treated 

with other drugs.  

Xativa is being supplied to CMOS and CACOS studies in Australia 

with Applied Cannabis Research which aims to collect data from 

more than 20,000 patients nationwide within five years. During 

FY2021, Xativa was included in the ARTG list of drugs approved 

for export from Australia.  

Nutraceutical products 

We believe that our WaferiX drug delivery platform is suitable for 

the development of other products that incorporate active 

pharmacological compounds. We strive to combine innovative 

formulations and delivery systems to produce next-generation 

nutraceuticals which bring visible and perceptible change to 

improve our customers' health on a cellular level. 

▪ 

LumeniX &amp; RadianiX 

What it is: Sublingual glutathione wafer for fair and healthy skin  

 

Active compound: glutathione 

 

LumeniX is a skin brightening formula designed to lighten and 

beautify the skin. Glutathione, which is the key ingredient, 

reduces skin hyperpigmentation and gives a fairer complexion. 

It also has the benefit of being an important antioxidant that 

protects the liver. LumeniX is formulated with patented 

WaferiX sublingual technology for an enhanced bioavailability 

of glutathione. 

 

▪ 

SL-NAD+ 

What it is: Sublingual NAD+ wafer 

 

Active compound: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 

 

SL-NAD+™ contains pure NAD+. Known as the molecule of 

youth, NAD+ combats aging, supports energy generation, and 

activates sirtuins (antiaging genes). For the first time ever, our 

patented sublingual delivery technology, WaferiX®, ensures 

direct delivery of pure and intact NAD+ into the bloodstream, 

without the need for invasive intravenous drips or injections.
