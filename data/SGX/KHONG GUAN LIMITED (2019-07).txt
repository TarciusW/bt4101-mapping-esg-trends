Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2019   -   1 

Message from the Board of Directors 

 

We are pleased to present Khong Guan Limited’s (KGL) Sustainability Report for our financial 

year ended 31 July 2019 (the “Report”). This Report is set out on a “comply or explain” basis in 

accordance with Rule 711B and Practice Note 7.6 of the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Manual on Continuing Listing Obligations.  KGL has chosen 

the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework as it is the most established international 

sustainability reporting standard and in respect of the extent to which such framework is applied, 

this Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI reporting guidelines, at “Core” 

option. Corresponding to GRI’s emphasis on materiality, the Report highlights the key 

environmental, social and governance related initiatives carried out by KGL throughout a 12-

month period, from 1 August 2018 to 31 July 2019. 

 

In defining our reporting content, we applied the GRI principles by considering the KGL Group’s 

activities, impacts as well as expectations and interests of our stakeholders. We observe the 

following four principles: materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability index and 

completeness. For reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, comparability, 

accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability.  

 

The ESG data and information provided have not been verified by an independent third party. 

Data has been obtained from reports generated from internal accounting systems and we have 

relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy. 

 

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as this will 

enable us to improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments and 

suggestions to enquiries@kg.com.sg 

 

 

 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2019   -   2 

Board Statement on Sustainability 

 

KGL recognizes the importance of sustainability and we have a Sustainability Committee that 

leads sustainability efforts throughout the group. The Sustainability Committee reports directly to 

the Board which considers sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determines 

the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and oversees the 

management and monitoring of these factors. 

 

The Group is always adapting to key stakeholders’ concerns, closing any potential gaps and 

capitalizing on any given opportunity. KGL’s board is positively committed to support the 

management in upholding governance and sustainability practices to achieve long-term success 

and value for all our stakeholders. 

 

 

Sustainability Governance 

 

At KGL we believe strong governance is the key to a sustainable business. Throughout the 

2019 financial year, we continued to comply with the Singapore Exchange (SGX) Code of 

Corporate Governance. Please refer to the Financial Statements for further details. 

 

As part of our commitments together with our subsidiaries and associates, our products and 

services meet all the requirements of our customers and the regulatory bodies of the countries 

being Malaysia and Singapore, we operate in. We work towards having all our products meet all 

the environmental and safety standards that are expected of us. 

 

The Group has procedures, especially in KGL’s 30% associate, United Malayan Flour (UMF), in 

place to enforce good labour practices in all our operations. We also provide many training 

opportunities for continuous employee development. The results are a loyal workforce, many of 

whom have been with us for decades, as well as the quality and delivery of our products and 

services. We strongly believe that in the long run, enforcing good labour practices will have a 

positive impact on our economic performance. We value our relationships with our clients and 

the wider community in which we operate and it is these relationships that helped us through 

challenging times in the past.

About our Business 

 

The Group, which comprises KGL and its subsidiaries possess a thriving trading and distribution 

business in Malaysia dealing in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products and food 

ingredients. These are operated through holdings in our subsidiaries Tong Guan Food Products 

Sdn Bhd (TGF) and Swee Hin Chan Company Sdn Bhd (SHC). In addition, our 30% equity held 

associate, United Malayan Flour (1996) Sdn Bhd (UMF) is a diversified group mainly dealing in 

wheat flour, oatmeal, pulses, cooking oils and cereals  

 

This report focuses on KGL’s subsidiaries SHC and TGF as well as our associate, UMF; and in 

turn, UMF’s subsidiary, Federal Oat Mills (FOM). Together, these business units contribute to 

the majority of our economic activity and/or financial results.  Please refer to the group chart 

below showing the relationships of the subsidiaries and its associates.

The Group has a diversified portfolio of products and exports to over 30 countries worldwide. 

 

SHC is an established and renowned importer and distributor of high-quality flour and starches. 

Steeped in tradition yet enterprising, SHC has built a proven track record of delivering high-

quality flour and starch products with value pricing and reliable service. 

 

Our wheat flour and starch products are halal certified by Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malalysia 

(JAKIM). JAKIM is the agency responsible for the Islamic affairs including halal certification of 

products required by Shariah laws in Malaysia. Today, SHC’s starch business is one of the 

market leaders in Malaysia. 

 

TGF was incorporated in March 1973, and commenced business as an importer and distributor 

of flour and biscuits. It has been entrusted with the responsibility of marketing our wide range of 

products for the state of Sabah. 

 

Today, TGF has grown into a full-fledged trading house that markets and distributes consumer 

products, such as foodstuffs and household products, from a variety of renowned brands 

throughout the entire state of Sabah. Specifically, the range of products includes biscuits, 

snacks &amp; candies, canned food, beverages, household, oral and personal care items produced 

by leading international manufacturers such as Khong Guan, Ayam Brand, Mentos, Captain 

Oats and Tai Sun.  A large sales force that services more than 3,000 retail outlets supports the 

branch offices in all major towns of Sabah. This dedicated sales force ensures that our 

branches are able to operate smoothly and effectively. 

 

TGF has been importing and distributing products from renowned brands for over 40 years in 

Sabah, from cities to small towns and villages through outlets such as supermarkets, mini-

markets, retail shops, hotels, modern food and beverage outlets, coffee shops and roadside 

stalls. Our distribution strength has helped our principal partners’ brands to reach many corners 

of Sabah. 

 

The Group and all its subsidiaries have always focused on product safety and compliance with 

local laws and regulations to bring our consumers quality products. We have also long focused 

on developing our human resources to ensure sustainable economic performance. Today, these 

values serve us well as we proudly present our Report.

Management Approach 

 

In preparation for this Report, in June 2019, the Group carried out an annual thought exercise 

with the senior staff and external stakeholders at KGL, TGF and SHC to determine what values 

each entity finds important today, visualize these values and then map them against new 

sustainability targets that we will establish on a going forward basis.  For FY2019, we have 

identified socioeconomic compliance as the key material factor:

Our sustainability team is made up of representatives from each main subsidiary of the Group. 

The Group has constituted a Sustainability Committee with one sustainability officer from each 

of its subsidiaries: SHC and TGF and two sustainability officers from KGL itself to further refine 

and develop our sustainability efforts. In addition, UMF works closely with KGL on its 

sustainability initiatives and efforts.  Please see Diagram 3 for the “Composition of Sustainability

endeavors. We view stakeholder engagement as a continual process. We engage with our 

stakeholders in a variety of formal and informal settings from the annual general meeting to 

ongoing dialogue with our partners and suppliers on how to improve our products and supply 

chains.  We listen to feedback from our consumers regarding our products, including those 

under FOM, a subsidiary of UMF.  Our operations as well as those under our associate, UMF, 

continually engage with relevant authorities to ensure we stay abreast of any concerns and legal 

developments. We also listen to our employees and engage with industry trade groups in our

Market Presence 

 

SHC operates a network of distributors and manufacturers for starches, wheat flour and food 

products in Malaysia. 

 

The key strength of TGF is the strength of our distribution network across all major towns in 

Sabah. We supply and deliver a wide range of basic food products such as flour, cooking oil, 

dairy products and enable our customers to enjoy the ease of having a single supply source for 

the majority of their food products. Building on this strength, TGF continues to expand upon the 

range of products we carry. 

 

UMF serves a wide clientele base from small-medium enterprises to large-scale multinational 

manufacturers through an extensive distribution network that spans the Peninsular and East 

Malaysia, as well as Singapore and Thailand.  

 

Environmental 

 

Energy and Water 

 

Being a stakeholder in the environment in which we operate in, the Group will continue to 

monitor electricity and water usage to ensure they do not vary greatly from the previous year. 

Currently the electricity and water usage costs are not deemed material in our business and, 

barring unforeseen circumstances, are not expected to have any significant increases in the 

foreseeable future.

Figure 1, “Length of Service of KGL Employees”, shows that many of our employees have 

offered significant and loyal services to the Group for many years, with a significant number 

having stayed with us for more than 21 years.  Employee turnover rate has been low, less than 

1% in FY2019, which is not significantly different from FY2018.  This bears testament to the 

efficacy of our employment policy, which espouses the ideals of “family friendly” working 

conditions.  We believe that our employees are happy with the prospect of life-long employment 

at the Group where we treat them as part of the family.  

 

Figure 1A, “Length of Service of UMF Employees”, shows a similar situation for UMF. 

 

 

Figure 2, below compares the gender composition of the Group, in FY2018 and FY2019.  About 

70% of employees are male and the balance, female.

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Training and Education 

 

The Group has internal processes to ensure risks are minimized and that all potential hazards 

are identified and precautions are taken. 

 

The KGL group of companies have formal management meetings at least every quarter 

together with the health and safety committee in order to update workplace safety protocols. If 

there are new products or equipment to be launched or purchased,  as the case may be, more 

management meetings will be held. 










 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2019   -   14 

 

UMF conducts safety training programmes annually. These include safety personal protective 

equipment (PPE) training and fire drills. In addition, we have off-site training for our staff in more 

specialised areas such as planning for chemical handling and confined space operations. 

 

 

Access management 

 

Access to the Group’s facilities and offices is granted via an access card system with visitors 

requiring visit permits. The access control system will only provide cards to new employees after 

job confirmation with the Group. New employees prior to formal job confirmation will be 

registered as visitors. 

 

 

Ill-health related to work 

 

The Group documents all workplace-related health-related incidents along with a medical report. 

The Safety Committee will study how to avoid a recurrence of an incident and if deemed 

necessary, updated safety guidelines will be drafted by the Safety Committee for further 

dissemination and training. 

 

Management strives to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is at the top of our 

priorities at every level of the Group. KGL and all its subsidiaries abide by government and 

industry health and safety regulations. We have adequate training for the workforce so that they 

may carry out their duties safely and confidently. 

 

Environmental matters are of course one of the issues KGL takes most seriously and the Group 

remains committed to minimizing our environmental impact in all areas of the Group’s 

operations while preserving and enhancing the quality of life for employees, customers and the 

communities in which we operate. 

 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

 

The Group has a non-discriminatory and equal opportunity employment hiring policy and will 

continue to monitor compliance with the policy carefully going forward. 

 

 

Labour Practices and Grievance Mechanisms 

 

The Group has a clear labour grievance procedure. Any affected staff can raise concerns with 

their Head of Department (HOD) and the HOD will forward the matter to management if 

required. 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2019   -   15 

 

All employees are subject to an annual performance review and are given constructive feedback 

for their future development. 

 

 

Child Labour &amp; Forced or Compulsory Labour 

 

We do not tolerate the use of child labour, nor exploitation of children, in any of our operations 

and facilities. Child labour, as defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 

Convention is “work by children under the age of 12; work by children under the age of 15 that 

prevents school attendance; and work by children under of age of 18 that is hazardous to the 

physical or mental health of the child”. 

 

We shall not employ children that fall into the definition as stipulated by ILO Convention. 

 

We do not conduct business with partners who do not share our views on zero tolerance for 

child labour. 

 

The Group is committed to ensuring that there is no forced or compulsory labour in any part of 

our business and in our supply chain partners. We are committed to ethical and responsible 

dealings in our business relationships. Going forward to strengthen adherence to our policy 

against child labour or exploitation of children. 

 

 

 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2019   -   16 

Indigenous Rights 

 

We do not discriminate and hiring is based on merits of the candidates. We will closely monitor 

compliance with the aforesaid hiring policy. 

 

 

Anti-corruption Policies and Procedures 

 

We shall not engage in bribery or any form of financial crime. We must never offer, promise or 

give bribes in connection with our business and we must never ask for or accept bribes. At KGL, 

we have company policies that all employees are made aware of the anti-corruption policies and 

procedures. 

 

Material Factor 

 

Regulatory Compliance 

Throughout FY2019, there have been no incident of non-compliance with the socioeconomic 

goals, laws and regulations we have identified as relevant to the Group, which are described in 

more detail throughout this report. 

 

Practices to manage regulatory compliance 

Laws and regulations relevant to our operations are mainly Companies Act (Chapter 50), Listing 

Rules of the Singapore Exchange.  The Group believes in instilling its employees with a culture 

of compliance and a high standard of ethics in carrying out their duties.  This would mitigate any 

non-compliance as we understand good governance would allow the Group to manage its risks 

and opportunities, and deliver sustainable returns or value for our stakeholders. 

 

Employees  

All employees are briefed on the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, and the Whistle-

blowing policy during the orientation and induction programme. 

 

KGL and its subsidiaries receive regular updates from relevant authorities on changes to 

regulations, which are relevant to its operations. KGL receives regular updates from relevant 

authorities on changes to regulations. Staff members may also attend seminars to familiarise 

themselves with any such updates. 

 

 

 

 


 

Khong Guan Limited Sustainability Report 2019   -   17 

Developed and implemented a Board Assurance Framework with an 

Enterprise Risk Management Framework  

The Group regularly review its operations to identify significant risks it faces, the potential 

impact and likelihood of such risks, and the effective action plans undertaken to mitigate those 

risks. 

 

Results of Monitoring Effectiveness

in relation to significant risks, including financial, operational, compliance-related controls, as 

well as the risk management system and found them to be adequate and effective as at 31 July
