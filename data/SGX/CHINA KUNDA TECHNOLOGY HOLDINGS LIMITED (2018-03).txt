THE REPORT


China Kunda positions ourselves at the heart of sustainability as we believe that 

having sustainable growth acts as the groundwork for creating long-term value in our 

business. 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) conducts a regular review, assessment and 

feedback process on critical Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics which 

were previously identified through a materiality assessment by senior management 

and core staff, and verified by independent sustainability consultants. This process 

of identification, assessment, monitoring and documentation of material risks and 

corresponding internal controls ensures that these key sustainability matters (as 

listed on page 13) are incorporated into the Group’s long-term strategic formulation, 

allowing the Board to focus on developing policies and setting feasible targets and 

action plans, in order to be accountable to our stakeholders. Additionally, the Audit 

Committee visits the domestic operations each year to formally review and approve 

and verify the Company’s sustainability reporting, acting as a form of internal 

assurance. 

The objective is to strike the right balance between financial, social and environmental 

developments and to safeguard our stakeholders’ interests.  We achieve that by 

upholding good governance, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations, 

creating a conducive working environment for our employees and striving for 

competitive edge via innovation and R&amp;D. 

Going forward, as China Kunda grows our businesses, we will continue to conduct our 

business and interact with stakeholders in a transparent and sustainable manner.

Geographical Location

China Kunda currently has one manufacturing site in Shenzhen, China, which is 

the area for this year’s scope of reporting. In FY2018, our Group decided to cease 

the production of automobile components at our Beijing manufacturing facility. This 

is mainly due to strict air pollution control measures implemented by the Beijing 

Municipal Government, and the relocation of our key customer, Beijing Hyundai, to 

Cangzhou and Chongqing.

Our Group adheres to the highest standards of corporate governance, constructing 

a strong foundation for delivering sustainable value to all stakeholders. Under our 

Enterprise Risk management (“ERM”) Framework, the Board, with the support from 

audit committee, oversees the system of risks management and internal controls. 

They are supported by the Senior Management which governs the process of risk 

assessment, risk management and risk monitoring, with assistance from the external 

advisors. The Senior Management also monitors the daily operations and internal 

management procedures of the Group. All concerns are then reported to the Board 

for a quarterly risk assessment review to make improvements on the current plans.

Sustainability Governance 

To address sustainability risk, the management team headed by our Chief Executive 

Officer, monitors the sustainability performance and initiatives at various operating 

units. Under the management team, the Heads of Department are responsible for

Materiality Assessment

To determine the core material matters for our inaugural Sustainability Report, we 

sought the guidance from independent sustainability consultants to conduct our 

first materiality assessment. These material matters take into account the Economic, 

Environmental, Social and Governance (EESG) impacts to our business. The outline of 

our materiality assessment is summarized in Figure 6 below.

Figure 6: China Kunda’s four steps of materiality assessment 

Step One:

identification

Step Two: 

Priortisation

Step Three: 

Validation

Step Four:

Review

The results of the materiality assessment include perspectives of both internal and 

external stakeholders and are presented in Figure 7. Through this process, four 

material matters were identified according to their importance to our business.

Regulatory Compliance

At China Kunda, we ensure conformity to highest of standards to safeguard the 

interests of our stakeholders. To achieve this, we promote the active roles of employees 

in ensuring compliance. All employees are required to sign a declaration form upon 

the commencement of their jobs to acknowledge their agreement to abide by the 

rules outlined in the Employee Handbook. These rules cover issues such as workplace 

conduct and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Actions will be taken on 

those who neglect the stated rules. For first time offender, a notice will be issued and 

a self-reflection is required from the employee. Subsequently, repeat offenders will 

receive severe penalties or even dismissal from their job.

We treat the matter of non-compliance seriously and encourage our stakeholders to 

raise all material concerns through our reporting channel. The process of grievance 

handling is as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: China Kunda’s Grievance Handling Process

In the previous reporting year, we had one case of environmental non-compliance in 

our silk-screen workshop. Following up with the feedback, we have since upgraded our 

manufacturing facilities and improved on the work process to ensure environmental 

compliance.

Innovation and R&amp;D

With the increase in market demand and strong competition from the industry 

competitors, innovation and R&amp;D is pertinent to sustain a competitive edge. At China 

Kunda, we drive towards the goal of being an independent innovator, deploying 

cutting-edge technology to optimize our manufacturing processes. We also conduct 

stringent testing on our existing products and garnered customer feedbacks for 

continuous improvement. 

Our Innovation Incentive Policy3 was implemented to reward departments that initiate 

and develop innovative projects. All projects are approved by our Core team and 

Technical Director on an annual basis. Since implementation, the policy has resulted in 

various new product designs; such as phone battery covers and electronic cigarettes 

using UV transfer technology and colour plating technology. Approved projects are 

eligible for a ¥1,500 reward per project and patent projects are eligible for a ¥2,000 

reward per project.

In FY2018, we have invested HK$1,498,000 in 92 projects, yielding 1 newly registered

Material Use

Apart from developing new technologies, resource management is also crucial to 

the sustainability of our business. At China Kunda, we strive to reduce our ecological 

footprint in the environment by managing our resources wisely. In our efforts to do 

so, we make it a regular practice to keep track of our material consumption. 

Figure 11: Total weight of key non-renewable materials used

In 2018, the sum of non-renewable materials consumption decreased by 8.4% from 

622,664 kg to 570,065 kg, due to the reduction in usage of our plastic sheet and pellet. 

On the other hand, there was a slight increase in usage of paint and protective film 

from 13,927kg to 15,276kg and 139,260kg to 157,800kg respectively. This is largely 

attributed to the change in our engineering process and our product portfolio. 

At China Kunda, we have taken the initiative to reuse cardboard packing materials by 

increasing the total number of reclaimed cardboard from 2.2% to 3.8%. Our overall 

usage of the cardboard has also decreased from 19,348 pieces to 16,396 pieces. 

By monitoring our materials used, we were able to improve our sustainability efforts 

and optimise our manufacturing processes. An incentive system is in place to award 

employees based on their performance in managing the company’s resources. This is 

evaluated based on their ability to reduce overall material cost ratio.

Case study: Double-sided Injection Moulding Production Process

China Kunda has always sought new ways to optimise the production process and the 

double sided injection moulding production process is our latest invention. 

The production process begins by employing a four-color printing to obtain a front film 

and Keshi -color printing to obtain a back film. A customised shape is acquired through 

the cutting and shaping of the two films which are then placed in an injection mould to 

be filled with transparent engineering material. A nozzle cut is then performed on the 

solidified mould. The resulting product will then be sent for examining and packaging 

thereafter.

We observed an increase in product yield rate by 20% and a decrease in product 

deformation by 50%, resulting in the overall reduction of material wastage.

Training and Advancement

We believe a strong workforce plays a big role in our pursuit of building a sustainable 

business; hence at China Kunda, we focused on providing proper training for all 

employees. New hires are required to attend mandatory workshops conducted by the 

Human Resource Department to integrate them into our company culture seamlessly. 

These workshops also include details on production safety, mechanical operation and 

product quality requirements. Employee performance assessments are carried out 

regularly. Following the assessment, career planning sessions are planned to align 

employees’ performance with the future plans of the company. China Kunda also 

provides subsidies to our employees who seek to upgrade their skills. 

Figure 12: Employee training hours

In 2018, we saw a decrease in training hours for both managerial and non-managerial 

roles, clocking 86.7 hours and 11.7 hours each respectively. It was because there has 

been no significant movement in the workforce. The training provided previously 

are considered still relevant and re-training is not required. The training hours 

for managerial roles are also longer than those for non-managerial roles as more 

managerial skill courses have been arranged.
