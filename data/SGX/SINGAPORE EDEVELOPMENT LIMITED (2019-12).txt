Board Statement 

Dear Stakeholders,  

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board” or “Directors”) of Singapore eDevelopment 

Limited (“SeD” or “the Group”), we are pleased to present to you the third Sustainability 

Report (“SR”) of our Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). 

At SeD, we recognize that sustainability issues form an integral part of our operations and 

strategies, and we strive to drive our operations in the direction in which we can 

contribute positively to all our stakeholders.  

The report provides an avenue for us to keep our stakeholders informed about our 

sustainability performance in an accountable and transparent manner. It will also 

highlight the Group’s strategies, policies, practices, performances, and targets, for the 

period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”), in relation to the economic, 

environmental, social and governance factors as stated in the GRI Standards.  

This report draws on the internationally recognized framework, the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting Standards. After conducting a materiality 

review and assessment with our external consultants, we have identified eight (8) 

indicators that matter most to our business, and to both internal and external stakeholders.  

These material issues have been taken into account through our four sustainability 

strategies – Business Integrity, Economic Performance, Environmental Sustainability and 

Human Capital.

Board Statement 

Business Integrity 

We do not tolerate any form of corruption or fraud within the Group. Business integrity and 

corporate governance is an important core value of SeD. 

The Board is strongly committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance. 

In addition to complying with the recommendations of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018, policies have also been established to address business conduct 

expected of all employees. Our whistleblowing policy provides avenues for staff to raise 

concerns about suspected reportable conduct which may adversely affect the Group. 

We are happy to share that there was no incident of corruption for FY2019.  

 

Economic Performance  

SeD believes in the creation of long-term economic value and a stable economic 

performance of the Group. In addition to the Group’s financial performance, SeD also 

focuses on the indirect impact of our infrastructure investments on the stakeholders and 

the economy.  

 

Environmental Sustainability 

SeD is committed to minimizing our environmental impact and is working towards 

reducing our energy footprint. Together with our staff, we have succeeded in reducing 

the electricity consumption in FY2019 through conscious efforts to save electricity 

whenever we can.  

 

Human Capital 

Employees are highly valued as they are a key to the contribution of SeD’s growth and 

success. In addition, our gender ratio of employees has improved slightly as compared 

to last year.  

 

Looking Ahead 

SeD’s Board will continue to oversee the management and monitoring of the economic, 

environment and social concerns material to the sustainability of our business.  

We appreciate having all our stakeholders on this journey together with us, to build a 

more sustainable future.

Our Approach to Sustainability  

 

Materiality Review Process 102-46 102-47 

We applied the GRI reporting principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, the sustainability 

context, materiality and completeness – in defining the report content by considering the 

Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of our stakeholders. 

In determining the material topics relevant to FY2019, SeD performed an internal strategy 

review which included a relook at our business strategy, business model and key 

stakeholders and processes to identify the Group’s significant economic, environmental 

and social impacts.  

We reflected on significant economic, environmental and social impacts to determine 

aspects that are material to the organization as they are integral to SeD’s success of 

building a sustainable future for all of our stakeholders.  

We identified the following eight (8) indicators during the review conducted. The 

materiality assessment was subsequently endorsed by the Sustainability Executive 

Reporting Committee.

Business Integrity 102-16 205-2 205-3 

SeD is committed to achieving and maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance and business integrity 

within the Group. 

 

By having a high standard of corporate governance, it helps to ensure the stability and 

sustainability of the Group’s performance, protect the interests of shareholders of the 

Group and enhance long-term shareholders’ value and returns. 

The Group has substantially complied with the recommendations of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018 (“Code”) to outline the corporate governance practices 

adopted by the Group in our Corporate Governance Report.  

 

Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures  

Our whistleblowing policy was set up with the purpose to encourage the reporting in good 

faith of suspected reportable conduct by establishing clearly defined processes. It allows 

the staff of the Group and any other persons to raise concerns.   

The objectives of the whistle-blower protection policy are to: 

• 

Provide for the mechanisms by which whistle-blowers may report Reportable Conduct; 

• 

Enable the Group to effectively deal with reports from whistle-blowers, in a way that 

will protect the identity of the whistle-blowers and persons who participate in 

investigations initiated under this policy, and provide for the secure storage of the 

information provided; 

• 

Establish the policies for protecting whistle-blowers and persons who participate in 

investigations initiated under this policy, against reprisal by any person internal or 

external to the Group; and provide for an appropriate infrastructure for receiving, 

investigating and taking corrective or remedial action in relation to such reports. 

SeD has designated the company’s secretary as the Receiving Officer, who reports 

directly to the Audit and Risk Management Committee Chairman on all matters arising 

under this policy.

Economic Performance 

By adopting responsible business practices and embedding 

sustainability in our business, SeD believes it can create long 

term economic value and contribute to a stable economic 

performance of the Group.  

 

Our Performance 201-1 

The Group’s revenue has increased by S$5.4 million or 20% from S$26.9 million from FY2018 

to S$32.3 million in FY2019 due to contributions of revenue from the property development 

project  located in Frederick County, Maryland USA (“Ballenger Run”), the property 

development project located in Houston, Texas (“Black Oak”) and the revenue from the 

sale of biomedical products. 

Total operating expenses decreased by $0.9 million or 11% from $8 million in FY2018 to $7.1 

million in FY2019. This is mainly due to cost savings achieved through the streamlining of 

our corporate expenditure. 

For the full details of the Group’s economic performance, kindly refer to our Annual Report 

2019. 

 

Indirect Economic Impacts 203-1 

Besides the direct economic value being generated, SeD also focuses on the indirect 

impact our infrastructure investments can have on the stakeholders and the economy. 

Our investment in the community is shown by designing highways, streets, roads, or 

common driveways guided by the following principles: 

• 

Design for opportunities to create interconnections between adjoining parcels. 

• 

Provide for safety, efficiency, and convenience of all users of the transportation 

system. 

• 

Be suitably located and designed/improved to accommodate prospective traffic, 

emergency service vehicles, and road maintenance equipment. 

Transportation systems and parking areas are intended to be adequate to serve the 

proposed use in addition to existing uses by providing safe and efficient circulation, and 

design consideration that maximizes connections with surrounding land uses and 

accommodates public transit facilities. 

During our development for the Ballenger Run project, SeD agreed that it would convey 

a plot of land to the Frederick County Board of Education (“BOE”). The plot of land was 

conveyed with no monetary consideration for a public-school site totaling a minimum of 

13+/- acres, to serve the project and the surrounding regions. 


 

 

 

 

 11 

 

Economic Performance 

In addition, we work closely with various parties to understand the most recent market 

demand. One such project involves the rezoning and construction of a multi-family 

continuing care retirement community (“CCRC”). We have completed the rezoning 

CCRC and have commenced its construction to hold approximately 36 age-restricted 

villa lots. 

 

Procurement Practices 204-1 

By supporting local suppliers, SeD can indirectly attract additional investment to the local 

economy. It can also help to supply, support a steady local economy, and sustain 

community relations. 

All the contractors we engage for the Ballenger Run and Black Oak Project are based in 

the USA. These contractors hire locals for the construction work and generally source their 

materials locally.

Environment 

With the growing awareness and importance of sustainability 

in 

Singapore, 

SeD 

is 

committed 

to 

minimising 

our 

environmental impact by focusing on reducing our energy 

footprint. 

 

Energy Consumption 302-1 

The consumption of electricity is being monitored on a monthly basis to measure the 

success of the initiatives that are implemented. We are happy to share that we have 

been able to reduce the overall electricity consumption of SeD in FY2019 as compared 

to FY2018.  

 

 

 

In FY2019, our Singapore office at Suntec Tower consumed a total of 5,339 kWh, a 

decrease of 237 kWh as compared to FY2018. This is attributable to the collective efforts 

of staff who are conscious of the importance of saving energy and, through reminders, 

practice good energy-saving habits. 

 

The decrease was due to our staff having the knowledge, being reminded and aware of 

the importance of reducing their electricity consumption.  

 

Our Houston office reported a total consumption of 6,929 kWh, a decrease of 1,677 kWh 

as compared to FY2018. The decrease was due to constant reminders to staff to save 

energy.

Reduction of Energy Consumption 302-4 

The actions taken to reduce energy consumption include using LED lights and constantly 

reminding staff to be mindful of the need to save electricity (e.g. switching off their 

computer at the end of the day or switching off the lights in each room when they are 

not in use). 

While the Group is not able to promise a specific level of energy reduction, we will monitor 

our energy consumption and make plans to reduce our energy consumption levels 

through the implementation of other energy-saving measures.

Social 

Employees are a crucial asset to SeD as they play a 

significant role in ensuring a high level of efficiency and 

achieving greater output.  

Employment 102-7 102-8 401-1 

 

Employee headcount as at 31 December 2019 decreased by 3 personnel from 20 in 

FY2018 to 17 In F2019. Being a global group, we have employees of different nationalities

in FY2019. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition to the Group’s employees, SeD also outsources the development and project 

management activities to third-party contractors and consultants.  

The gender distribution of our staff has improved in FY2019. The proportion of male staff to 

their female counterparts is 53% to 47% compared to 60% (Male) to 40% (Female) in 

FY2018.   

 

In terms of age distribution, the majority of our employees remain to be between the ages 

of 40 – 49 (29% of the total headcount).
