4. CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

Delivering health and wellness to communities in which we operate is the focus of our initiatives to 

contribute to the society. In 2018, we continued with our heritage of providing Tiger Balm products to 

those in need.  

  

We believe that no one should be constrained from leading an active life, and sport is a force for 

wellbeing and empowerment. Since 2015, Haw Par has been supporting athletes from Singapore 

Disability Sports Council (SDSC). Going beyond sponsorship of broad based competitions, Haw Par 

introduced a Sports Bursary this year to help financially-marginalised athletes to sustain their sports 

development, enabling more to live healthier and active lives. In 2018, Haw Par received a Certificate 

of Recognition for its contribution to disability sports in Singapore jointly issued by the International 

Paralympics Committee, Singapore National Paralympic Council and Singapore Disability Sports 

Council. 

  

We recognise that healthy communities do largely depend on a healthy planet, which is in turn 

dependent on healthy ecosystems with rich biodiversity. Haw Par is a supporter of the United Nations 

Decade on Biodiversity 2011-2020 and our Blue Mission at Underwater World Pattaya aims to inspire, 

educate, conserve. As the tiger and leopard, listed among the most endangered species on Earth, are 

the namesakes of Haw Par and our company founders, we have been sponsoring the Malayan Tiger 

Exhibit and the Leopard Exhibit at the Night Safari and the Singapore Zoo since 1995 and 1986 

respectively.    

 

The United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 to achieve sustainable 

development for all by 2030. Haw Par contributes to five of the goals.

that were 

screened for 

compliance with 

local labour law 

 Supplier Code of Conduct aims to integrate our sustainability principles across our 

supply chain, and aims to positively influence the environmental, social and 

governance performance of our suppliers. 

 A vendor assessment is carried out for all contract manufacturers and suppliers 

based on product specifications and defined criteria. 

 Products are tested by qualified and competent laboratories. 

 Once our key suppliers meet Haw Par’s quality standards and regulatory 

requirements such as GMP certification for drug licence or ISO, they are subject to 

Haw Par audits. 

 We continually engage critical suppliers to remain updated on approved supplies 

of raw materials (our largest suppliers are in Asia).  

 In line with Haw Par’s policy, supplier audits are scheduled every three years for 

our key suppliers. 

 Authorities of a few countries like China and the U.S. such as the Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA) visited and audited our raw material suppliers.
