REDUCING OUR 

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 

We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint by minimising our energy 

and water consumption and managing waste from our operations in a responsible 

manner. We see this as a necessity to remain competitive in resource-constrained 

economy faced with the challenge of climate change. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 

Why material 

Our industry is energy intensive with our production sites, offices and warehouses being 

the key sources of energy consumption. Some of the processes that we use in our 

operations, such as welding, can use a lot of energy. Lowering our consumption can help 

reduce our operational costs and align our efforts towards global and national efforts to 

curb emissions and climate change. 

Management approach 

We are an ISO 14001:2015 certified organisation and our adherence to this standard 

highlights our precautionary approach to environmental risks. Our energy management 

efforts are guided by our environmental policy, which requires us to control 

environmental risks, develop environmental programs, promote best practices and 

develop awareness in managers, supervisors and workers.  

Performance 

In FY 2019, we carried out a few initiatives to reduce our energy consumption.  

To date, a major proportion of the lighting in the workshop and office building (59%) 

consists of energy efficient options (e.g. fluorescent/LED). We continually pursue end-of-

life lighting replacements with energy efficient alternatives.  

Disciplined usage of high-powered electrical equipment (e.g. welding machines, 

generators, compressors) in the workshop is now enforced by incorporating the 

behavioural requirement as a standard operating procedure for workshop activities. This 

includes switching off electrical supply to the equipment during break time, or after work 

completion. 

While we have taken a number of steps to reduce our energy consumption, we can often 

be constrained by the projects we undertake during the year and the total consumption 


16 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

can be work-load reliant. Our 

performance 

for 

FY 

2019 

is 

highlighted in the chart below, 

showing our electricity4 and diesel5 

consumption, which amounted to a 

total of 27,108 GJ during the year. 

Significant 

increase 

in 

diesel 

consumption 

was 

predominantly 

due to increase in site construction 

activities. As a reference, total man-

hours worked in FY2019 is almost 3 

times that of FY2018. 

Despite that, the increase in energy 

consumption was relatively modest 

at 114%.  

Furthermore, 

we 

achieved 

a 

reduction in office &amp; workshop 

electricity consumption by 10%. 

 

Targets 

We achieved our target to reduce office &amp; workshop electricity consumption by 5% in FY 

2019. 

By end FY 2020, we aim to increase the proportion of energy efficient lighting used in our 

office &amp; workshop to 65%

WATER CONSUMPTION 

Why material 

Water security is a rising global concern and of particular relevance to Singapore. Acute 

water shortages, which are already visible across large parts of Asia and globally, have 

started disrupting industrial operations. At Hiap Seng, we rely on water usage primarily 

for the hydro and load testing processes in projects, and for office use. We are conscious 

of the risks relating to water, and recognise the economic, social and environmental 

benefits from a strategic approach to water management.  

Management approach 

We strive to use alternate water sources, such as seawater, for testing processes whenever 

feasible to minimize consumption of utility water. 

Furthermore, our environmental policy encourages the use of water savings equipment 

and processes across Hiap Seng’s operations. Employees are sensitised on issues relating 

to water scarcity and advised to reduce water consumption on an active basis. 

Performance 

FY2019, we managed to reduce 

our office and workshop water 

consumption by 7%.  

Despite this, overall water 

consumption increased due to 

2 major project site activities 

where testing was carried out 

prior to commissioning.  

Similar to energy consumption, 

the amount of water we use is 

largely 

dependent 

on 

the 

number 

of 

projects 

undertaken, especially due to 

hydro 

and 

load 

testing 

activities at the end of the 

construction work.

Municipal water supplies (potable water) remained as the dominant source of water for 

our operations in FY 2019.  

 

We continue to explore the possibilities and maximize usage of alternative, more eco-

friendly water sources (as compared to potable water) whenever feasible, such as the 

usage of recycled industrial wastewater in one of our site project site commissioning 

activity. 

Targets 

Although our overall water consumption has increased due to project demands, we are 

pleased to have achieved our target to reduce office water consumption by 5% in FY 2019. 

For FY2020, we aim to maintain the current level of water consumption in the office and 

workshop, excluding water consumption used for testing activities.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

Why material 

Raw materials that go into our products, such as metal, are getting scarcer and more 

expensive. We recognise that in order to remain competitive, we will need to embrace 

concepts of a circular economy by increasing our efforts to reduce, recycle and reuse and 

thereby minimising our dependence on virgin materials.  

Management approach 

Our environmental policy guides our waste reduction and management processes 

including training to employees. We practice the hierarchy of waste management: 

Reduce, Reduce and Recycle. We engage only reliable waste treatment specialist to 

recover any remaining wastes. 

In order to reduce waste, we work towards optimising our procurement process and 

avoiding purchase of any excess raw materials.  

We embrace the usage of advanced software 

programs during engineering and fabrication 

that helps to maximum the use of raw materials. 

We use our integrated management system as a 

direction to handle hazardous waste that is 

generated as by-product of our operations, 

ensuring that they not inadvertently released to 

the environment without proper treatment. We 

continue to only work with reliable and 

responsible waste treatment specialists to 

dispose of both hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste. 

Performance 

Total amount of non-hazardous waste disposed in FY 2019 saw a slight increase by 17% to 

a total of 436MT. This is in line with the amount of engineering and construction work 

activities carried out. 







Reduce 

Reuse

20 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

An increase in proportion of waste that was either reused or recycled (including the form 

of compost)6 partially mitigated the impact of this increase. Our waste disposal vendor 

controls disposal methods7. 

 

The amount of hazardous waste disposed in FY 2019 was negligible, largely contributed 

to by fact that our activities in FY19 did not require chemical cleaning. Nevertheless, we 

recognize this to be an exception, and continue to expect to handle hazardous waste as 

part of our operations. 

Targets 

We achieved our target of not releasing any contaminating fluids or toxic waste into the 

environment.  

We indefinitely deferred our target of developing an environmental education program 

concerning proper e-waste management. E-waste currently consists only of a very small 

portion of our operations, and proper disposal of e-waste is currently well managed by the 

IT and logistics team. As such, we expected minimal benefits in implementing a company-

wide education program.  

For FY 2020, we reaffirm our aim of ensuring zero release of contaminating fluids or toxic 

waste into the environment during our operations. 

 

 

6 The data for non-hazardous waste disposal method is provided by our waste disposal vendor 

7 According to our vendor, all materials are recycled/reused to the maximum extent. Remainders are disposed of in 

accordance to material type: Concrete &amp; sand – land fill, paper, plastic &amp; metal – incineration, timber - compost

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

Why material 

Attracting and retaining the right talent is becoming challenging in our industry. High 

turnover rates can affect the bottom line through higher training costs and may impact 

knowledge continuity. Furthermore, given that foreign workers represent a significant 

portion of our workforce and are our direct workforce, we need to ensure that they are 

managed and treated fairly, equally and in compliance with local regulations.   

Management approach 

We address this material area through a few key considerations: (i) fair labour practices; 

(ii) talent attraction; (iii) training and development and; (iv) benefits and well-being.  

Fair labour practice 

Our human capital practices in Singapore are aligned with the ‘Tripartite Alliance for Fair 

and Progressive Employment Practices’ that promote fair and equitable employment 

practices. 

We recruit foreign workers through reputable agencies based on project requirement and 

closely ensure compliance to legal regulations (e.g. Employment of Foreign Manpower 

Act). The well-being of our foreign workers is important to us. For the workers we ensure 

they are housed in adequate dormitory facilities, provide them 3 meals a day, and arrange 

for additional amenities such as air-conditioned transport. 

Talent attraction 

We want to employ future leaders and attracting the right talent is key to our long-term 

success. Currently we rely on public recruitment channels and through referrals. We 

continue to explore internship programmes with reputable universities with the aim to 

offer positions to outstanding performers. 

Training and development 

Our workers go through all mandatory trainings and at times specialised trainings 

required by our customers. Foreign workers attend skills enhancement trainings. 

We encourage and offer grants to our managers and supervisors to enrol for optional 

training programs to update skills and knowledge in areas of their work. To enhance cross-

skill learning, we also offer opportunities for staff to enrol in programs that are not directly 

in their line of work.  

 

 


23 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

Well-being and benefits 

Incentives and benefits are another medium to drive employee satisfaction and boost their 

morale. We reimburse payments on medical, dental, corporate travel, hospital and 

surgical insurances. In addition, we support our employees during periods of joy and grief 

through our marriage and compassionate leave arrangements. We like to celebrate the 

success of the organisation with our employees. Project completion celebrations, 

company anniversary lunches, festival celebrations are some of the ways we express our 

gratitude towards our people.

Performance 

Total 

training 

hours 

provided 

to 

all 

employees amounted to more than 28,000 

hours; a significant increase by 60% from FY 

2018. 

Average training per female employee 

decreased, largely due less training hours 

attended by female employees. 

Conversely, average training per male 

employee increased by 20%. This is 

attributable to an increase in number of male 

production 

workers 

employed, 

whom 

typically receives the highest average 

training hours per employee amongst the 

different employee groups10. 

Across different employee categories, average training hours maintained relatively 

similar. Production workers continue to receive the most amount of training hours due to 

job and regulatory requirements. 

 

10 Our male employees include our production staff that undergo a number of mandatory trainings, while our female 

employees are mainly office staff. Hence, the average training received for males is much higher.

Through the exit interviews conducted 

with 

departing 

employees, 

we 

are 

satisfied that the company’s employment 

practices is not a root cause of most of the 

reasons for departures. 

We continue to observe for any trends in turnover rates within each employee category, 

to ensure that our employment practices remain equitable and attractive to all our 

employees.  

 

 

12 We calculate our employee turnover by diving the number of employee turnover in each category, by the average 

number of employees of that category over the entire financial year. This way, we have an employee turnover that is specific 

to each category (age or gender), and will allow us to monitor for higher turnover rates in those specific brackets.

The female to male average remuneration ratio shifted closer towards parity in all 

employee groups, a fair reflection of the company’s employment practices. The company 

continues to practice a merit-based remuneration policy. 

Targets 

In FY 2019, we launched a web-based internal communication system that is available to 

employees13. This is one of the ongoing initiative to enhance our workplace, making it an 

easier, safer or smarter for our employees. 

For FY 2020, we reaffirm our target to implement at least 1 initiative to enhance our 

workplace for our employees. 

 

 

 

13 Employees that are provided access to our information technology network can utilize the communication tool.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (OHS) 

Why material 

The engineering and construction industry is vulnerable to the risk of occupational health 

and safety. Our employees work in conditions that possess inherent accident risks and we 

see their protection as our prime duty. Any OHS incident will inadvertently result in 

negative impacts to our business operation, both tangibly and intangibly. 

Management approach 

We are OHSAS 18001:2007 certified and accredited with bizSAFE Star and bizSAFE Partner 

status by the Workplace Safety and Health Council Singapore (WHSC), a testament to our 

commitment to implement the highest standards of workplace safety.  

Occupational health and safety is a key focus area of focus for us and one we monitor 

closely through our Integrated Management System (IMS). Our Health and Safety, together 

with our Drug and Alcohol policies, guide our employees in maintaining a safe work 

environment. All employees must go through training on these policies. 

Contractor’s workers carry out a portion of our work, such as sub-contracted project work. 

We are careful about our selection of contractors and are responsible for the safety and 

protection of the contractors’ workers on our sites. A contractor performing work on behalf 

of Hiap Seng is required to execute their OHS activities in adherence to our IMS policies.  

Our risk management starts from the risk assessment stage. Our activities, products and 

services are assessed for their relevant hazards that may pose risk to employees, visitors 

and contractors. In view of the past incidents and the current control methods, these 

hazards are evaluated in terms of their severity and likelihood of happening, determining 

the risk level. Identified activities and hazards are recorded in a risk assessment form. 

Operations and activities that are associated with the identified risk are considered in 

setting the risk control action plan including the objectives and targets. Any changes in 

the activities and facilities are evaluated and control measures are updated accordingly. 

An annual review of the risk assessment form is performed. 

Some work activities pose a risk of resulting in high consequence injuries. Examples 

include pneumatic tests and lifting operations. These are identified based on risk 

assessments, or regulatory requirements. Hierarchy of controls are implemented to 

eliminate or minimize risks, including the use of a permit-to-work system for the high-risk 

activities. Procedures are also developed and used for such activities, ensuring 

appropriate risk mitigations are in place. 


29 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

We strongly inculcate safety behaviours at grassroots level. Safety coordinators conduct 

daily toolbox talks to share any incident and discuss any high-risk activities that may be 

coming up. Regular monthly safety committee meetings are conducted, where workgroup 

supervisors represent the workers under their management. At any point in time, 

employees and workers are encouraged to highlight any significant changes to their 

working conditions, so that a review of the risks and implementation of appropriate 

mitigations can be done timely. They are also given the right to refuse work if the work 

condition is deemed unsafe. As part of our IMS, employees are consulted on matters 

concerning OHS, such as performing risk assessments and procedure development or 

updates.  

Our workers’ occupational health is also considered in the overall risk management. 

Procedures help to facilitate safe and healthy workplaces when exposure to inherent, 

hazardous risks are unavoidable. Noise-monitoring, respiratory protection and radiation 

protection are the few examples that emphases on occupational health. Due to the 

laborious nature of work common to our industry, our workers are taught how to identify 

signs of fatigue, and implement treatment options according to the specific work 

environment they are in. 

We value the benefits of working with contractors and suppliers that have good OHS 

management systems, as it may not be possible to enforce direct control in all situations. 

As a bizSAFE Partner, we are encourage our contractors to participate in the bizSAFE 

program14. 

 

 

 

14 Participation of contractors in the bizSAFE program is managed through Hiap Seng procurement specifications (e.g. 

vendor assessment criteria)

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

Performance 

Our total recordable injury rate (TRIR) in FY 

2019 improved significantly to 0.2415.  

Similar to FY 2018, our employees and 

worker/contractors incurred 11 recordable 

injuries, with the total amount of man-hours 

worked increasing to 9.04 million16; almost 3 

times of that in FY 2018.  

The injuries generally consisted of back 

and ankle injuries, trip and falls, and cuts 

to the fingers. Nevertheless, we are 

pleased 

to 

achieve 

zero 

high 

consequence injuries or fatalities in FY 

2019. 

There was also an increase in first aid 

injuries and near miss cases reported in 

FY 2019.  

We continue to take a positive view 

towards reporting of near miss cases, and 

encourage reporting of such cases as 

they offer valuable learning for the rest of 

the 

organization. 

It 

also 

supports 

identification of any systemic OHS trends 

that may later result in injuries that are 

more serious. 

 

15 Our injury rate is calculated based on 200,000 hours. Currently we do not segregate injuries by male and female or by 

employees and workers/contractors. 

16 The figures do not include office-based employees, as their work hours are not directly measured. Nevertheless, risks in 

the office environment is still managed under our IMS (e.g. risk assessment, incident reporting). We will continually assess 

the inclusion of this information in future reports.

Targets 

In FY 2019, we reconsidered placing a target on the number of near miss cases reported 

to avoid unintentionally discouraging reporting of such incidents. 

Instead, we realigned our emphasis on OHS performance by focusing on the total 

recordable injury rate, as it is a balanced indicator of the result of our OHS management 

system. It also takes the variance in amount of work done into consideration. 

In FY2020, we aim to achieve the following: 

1. Achieve a TRIR of ≤ 0.3 

2. Successful renewal of our bizSAFE Star accreditation

LEADING OUR  

MARKETPLACE  

In today’s challenging times, it is crucial for organisations to manage issues pertaining 

to governance. Delivering superior quality while maintaining high standards of 

regulatory compliance and oversight over the supply chain is key to be a distinguished 

player in the market   

PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY 

Why material 

Product quality and safety issues are particularly important in engineering and 

construction related projects for the sectors where we operate. We serve large multi-

national clients and have spent years building the relationships that make us a vendor of 

choice. Exceeding on quality has been fundamental in bringing us to where we are. Any 

lapses can result in significant damage to our reputation and customer base. 

Management approach 

We strive to maintain high product and service quality and are guided by the ISO 

9001:2015 quality management system that is implemented as part of our integrated 

management system 

Our quality policy, which forms part of our IMS helps establish the processes to implement 

this system effectively. The policy provides guidance on the various attributes that 

contribute to quality including design, procurement, fabrication, inspection, testing and 

feedback.  This policy is defined and reviewed by top management to ensure that it 

reflects the nature and scale of products and services quality. The policy is communicated 

to all employees through IMS briefings, formal and informal meetings and training, 

including on-the-job training for new staff. We hold all employees, subcontractors and 

suppliers responsible to support the implementation of the policy. 

Performance 

There were no cases of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of our 

products and services in FY 2019. This a reflection of the rigour of the quality we emphasize 

in the products and services we provide to our clients. 

Targets 

Our target is to continue to incorporate quality and safety considerations in our projects in 

FY 2020, and maintain compliance without any safety incidents. 


33 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN 

Why material 

We have an extensive supply chain ranging from contractors, material and services 

providers, equipment and transport vendors. Annually, we work with more than 200 

unique suppliers, with total orders in excess of S$35m equivalent. 

We recognise that engaging responsible suppliers can help in reducing our sustainability 

impacts and compliance risks. Our customers request greater transparency down their 

value chain and we can facilitate that through responsible procurement. Furthermore, 

procurement through local suppliers helps us to both achieve positive impacts by growing 

the domestic economy, and reduce our environment footprint. 

Management approach 

We evaluate all our suppliers based on a set of criteria and their ability to meet our 

organisational requirements. In order to ensure rigour in supplier selection, our 

previously approved suppliers need to go through a re-evaluation cycle on frequent basis. 

Especially in the areas of health and safety, we only engage bizSAFE certified suppliers.  

Performance 

In FY 2019, 57.1% of procurement 

expenditure 

was 

from 

local 

suppliers17. 

The decrease was generally due to 

non-availability 

of 

high 

value 

materials and equipment by local 

suppliers, according to the project 

requirements. Direct procurement 

from overseas suppliers were the 

only available option.

Targets 

In FY 2019, we achieved both our targets: Exclusively engaging suppliers that have been 

qualified based on our internal performance evaluation, and maintaining majority in 

country (by value) procurement of goods and services. 

For FY 2020, we will maintain our target for a majority of our goods and services to be 

procured from local suppliers. 

100% engagement of internally approved suppliers is currently established to be well 

managed by our processes. 

In the longer term, we continue to aim to expand our supplier assessment and implement 

additional considerations (e.g. environmental, social, productivity) in the near future, as 

part of ongoing improvements to our procurement processes. 

 

 


35 

Hiap Seng Engineering Limited 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

Why material 

As a listed entity, we are subject to a number of regulatory compliance requirements 

pertaining to occupational health and safety, labour, environmental compliance, finance 

and markets. The various regulatory bodies that oversee our operations include the 

Ministry of Manpower, National Environment Agency and SGX among others.  

Adherence to these requirements defines our social, environmental and economic license 

to operate.  

Management approach 

Our IMS highlights all regulatory risks and lays out the roles, objectives and processes to 

ensure compliance. Our employees are given access to and training on the legal and other 

requirements to which we subscribe.  

Changes to the requirements are highlighted and communicated on a regular basis. 

Performance 

We are pleased to report that the company did not have any legal or regulatory non-

compliances in the social and economic areas in FY 2019. 

Targets 

We aim to maintain full compliance to all regulations in the areas we operate in for FY 2020.
