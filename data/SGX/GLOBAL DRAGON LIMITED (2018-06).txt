SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 

GRI 102-11, 102-18 

 

Sustainability is a vital part of the Group’s corporate strategy for achieving long-term growth. 

The values we create for our people, the environment and society at large very much determine 

our financial performance.  

 

The Group is headed by a board of directors (the “Board”), which is entrusted to lead, supervise 

and oversee the Company, with the fundamental principle to act in the best interests of the 

Company. The Board comprises five (5) members, three (3) of whom are Independent 

Directors and two (2) are Executive Directors. None of the Independent Directors has served 

the Company for more than nine (9) years from his/her date of first appointment to the Board. 

 

The Board regularly reviews the Group’s strategic business plans, assesses key risks, 

operational and financial performance of the Group to enable the Group to meet its objectives. 

The Board has the overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining a framework of good 

corporate governance in the Group, including the risk management systems and internal 

controls to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets.  

 

Apart from its statutory duties and responsibilities, the Board oversees the business affairs and 

dealings of the Group, determines the Group’s corporate strategies and sets its directions and 

goals. It also monitors and evaluates the Group’s operations and financial performance, 

establishes targets for the management of the Company, which comprises the Executive 

Chairman, Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) 

(collectively, the “Management”) and monitors the achievement of these targets.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

GRI 201-1 

 

For FY2018, the Group operated two reportable business segments, comprising the property 

development segment and property investment segment in a single principal geographical 

segment in Singapore, which form the Group’s strategic business units. The strategic business 

units each offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they are 

located in different geographical areas and require different marketing strategies. For each 

strategic business unit, the Group’s Executive Chairman reviews internal management reports 

at least on a monthly basis. 

 

The following summary describes the operations of each of the Group’s reportable business 

segments: 

(a)  “Property investment” segment relates to holding of investment properties to earn rentals 

and for capital appreciation; and 

(b)  “Property development” segment relates to development of residential and commercial 

properties. 

 

Performance is measured based on segment profit for the year, as included in the internal 

management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s Executive Chairman. Segment profit is 

used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most 

relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments. For more information on our financial 

performance in FY2018, please refer to the Annual Report 2018. 

 

As at 30 June 2018, the Group’s property investment portfolio consists of 25 units of the 999-

leasehold prime office located in Singapore’s Central Business District and the Group’s 

property development portfolio in Singapore is valued at a total GDV in excess of S$90 million. 

The Group will continue to seek an optimal mix and capital allocation between our property 

development segment and property investment segment and balance our assets portfolio for 

sustainable growth.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

GRI 102-8, 102-41, 401-2, 401-3, 404-1, 404-2, 404-3 

 

The Group pledges to create a workplace with mutual respect, fairness and equality for our 

employees.  

 

The Group acknowledges that the success of the Group rests upon the quality and dedication 

of our employees. The Group is supportive of diversity in cultures, nationalities, age group and 

gender, while at the same time, are aware of the need to support local communities, including 

hiring post-retirement employees above 62 years old. The remuneration packages for 

employees are determined based on performance, service, seniority, experience and scope of 

responsibility. As at 30 June 2018, 25% of our workforce are women at our headquarters. 

 

The Group also believes in full-time and permanent employment as this will give employees a 

sense of belonging and will allow employees to fully develop their careers at the Group. As at 

30 June 2018, the Group does not have any part-time and temporary employee. 

 

The Group reviews its employee handbook which covers all information that employees need, 

including work ethics, working hours, remuneration, training, performance review, employee 

share option scheme, insurance, leave and benefits regularly so that employees are always clear 

on the Group’s policies. As at 30 June 2018, the Group has conducted annual performance and 

career development review for all employees of the Group. Although parental leave is 

implemented within the Group, no employee has claimed the parental leave during FY2018.  

 

For staff development, the Group provides opportunities to employees for continuous learning 

and skills improvement. Employees are encouraged to attend training courses relating to soft 

skills and technical skills to improve themselves with the updated industry practices and 

regulations as well as relevant professional courses. The Group’s average training hours which 

include structured and unstructured training was 6 hours for FY2018. The Group will 

endeavour to further improve on this in the coming years. 

 

The Group will strive towards our goals of having a more diverse and inclusive workforce, 

with people from all nationalities, age groups, gender and all walks of life. To the best of the 

Group’s knowledge, there are no employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in 

FY2018.

SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLY CHAIN &amp; QUALITY MANAGEMENT 

GRI 102-9, 307-1, 416-2 

 

Through this Report, the Group hopes to identify opportunities for improvement and explore 

ways to improve sustainable practices across all aspects of our businesses. For supply chain 

sustainability management, the Group has implemented the vendor assessment and selection 

criteria to mitigate and prevent negative impacts resulting from our supply chain. All 

contractors and suppliers are reviewed and selected based on performance, workplace health 

and safety, environmental and social criteria. New contractors are assessed based on their track 

records and workplace health and safety practices before awarding the contracts. The Group 

strives to foster positive business relationships with business partners who are responsible and 

committed in their works. 

 

During the construction period, the Group requires all contractors to adhere to Workplace 

Safety and Health as required by Building &amp; Construction Authority (“BCA”). The Group 

conducts onsite inspection and attends site meetings regularly to ensure that the construction 

sites are in compliance with relevant construction rules and regulations. There had been no 

incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations and no workplace health 

and safety incident at our project sites during FY2018. 

 

 

 

TRANSPARENT GOVERNANCE &amp; ANTI-CORRUPTION 

GRI 102-16, 205-3 

 

The Group has implemented the whistle-blowing policy since 2006. The policy aims to provide 

an avenue for employees and external parties to raise concerns about misconducts in the Group 

and at the same time assure them that they will be protected from victimisation for whistle-

blowing in good faith. The Company’s employees and any external parties may, in confidence, 

raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters 

by submitting a whistle-blowing report to whistleblow@globaldragon.com.sg. There have 

been no incidents pertaining to whistle-blowing for FY2018 and the Group will strive to 

maintain this clean record. 

 

In addition, the Group adheres to the strong stance against any form of corruption within the 

Group. In the event that there is incident of corruption reported, the Group will conduct 

investigation, review and implement effective mitigating measures to prevent such recurrence. 

There was no reported incident of corruption for FY2018.
