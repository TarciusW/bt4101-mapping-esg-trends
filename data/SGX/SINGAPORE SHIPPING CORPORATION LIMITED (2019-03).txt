BOARD STATEMENT  

 

Dear Stakeholders,  

The Board is pleased to present Singapore Shipping Corporation’s (“SSC”) sustainability report for 2019. 

Our 2019 sustainability report is issued in accordance with the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited’s (“SGX-ST”) rules for sustainability reporting for all Singapore-listed companies. The report covers 

how the Group incorporates elements of sustainability in the core of its operational strategies, with reference 

to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2016). 

In this report, we outline our position, commitments and future plans on environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) issues that our stakeholders attach to our industry and in their decision-making 

process. We are fully committed to sustainable growth, and look forward to managing our operations while 

advancing labor standards, our zero tolerance for corruption and the protection of the environment.  

Based on a materiality assessment conducted in 2019, the management has recognised and retained the 

ten ESG factors that are material to the business from 2018. They are: Anti-Corruption, Regulatory 

Compliance, Occupational Health and Safety, Quality of Assets and Services, Employee Wellbeing and 

Engagement, Training and Career Development, Data Security and Customer Privacy, Effluents and Waste 

Management, Energy Consumption and Associated Green House Gas Emissions, and Local Community 

Investment &amp; Development.  

The Board has endorsed these ten ESG factors with the Sustainability Steering Committee’s (comprising 

of the Group’s management that reports directly to the Board) support, and further to last year’s progress 

on our sustainability efforts, continues to revise and supervise the management of sustainability-related 

risks and opportunities in these areas as well as the Group’s performance and targets for the upcoming 

year.  

The Group puts the safety of our employees and cargo onboard our vessels as our utmost priority. In 

addition to regularly updating and implementing strict safety standards and procedures, we actively 

collaborate with our partners to ensure we can deliver a holistic programme while fully meets our customers’ 

needs. We are pleased to maintain our clean record for regulatory and environmental compliance in FY 

2019.  

We will continue to regularly communicate our yearly sustainability progress, successes and challenges 

transparently with all of our stakeholders. We welcome any feedback you may have on our sustainability 

efforts.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

SSC’s FY2019 materiality assessment was conducted in consultation with key personnel from all aspects 

of our operations. 10 material matters were identified and prioritised from the perspective of both external 

and internal stakeholders according to their importance and relevance to our business and operations. 

Given that our core business operations did not change from FY2018, we have adopted the same 10 

material matters that were identified last year.

ESG ASSESSMENT 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

Given the negative implications of corruption, SSC aims to maintain its zero tolerance for corruption in the 

maritime industry through both multi-stakeholder collaboration and having proper checks and balances. 

This will translate into operational efficiencies, since bribery and “facilitation payments” are parasitic costs 

to our businesses that cannot be tolerated.  

To achieve this commitment, we have clear communication and collaboration between our clients, business 

partners and our employees of SSC’s stance and support for our crew and staff in avoiding any such 

payments. We also ensure that our external stakeholders are aware and clear of SSC’s anti-corruption 

policies and practices.  

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 12 | P a g e 

 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT  

The management of effluents and waste from our operations is of concern to SSC as mishandling could 

adversely affect our operations and damage our clients’ trust in us. We take every measure to do our part 

to minimise our operations’ impact on the environment. We believe that our business operations should not 

come at the expense of the environment and we are constantly seeking new ways to be more sustainable. 

 

Policies and Practices   

SSC’s vessels are compliant with the IMO Ballast Water 

Management Convention, which requires ocean faring vessels 

to have proper treatment procedures and plans to ensure that the 

ballast water, which is required to maintain safe and efficient 

modern shipping operations, is properly discharged. This is to 

reduce and control the pollution of marine environment through 

the accidental introduction of new or alien species to a particular 

marine environment, which may cause significant and harmful 

changes to the environment.  

In accordance with the International Convention on Oil 

Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-Operation, SSC’s 

vessels are equipped with emergency plans and measures in the 

unlikely event of an accidental pollution incident while on the high 

seas. Vessels are further equipped with incident report forms 

which go over and above what is required by the IMO to report 

any incident of pollution and the actions to combat, and prevent 

further incidents, from occurring.  

SSC’s vessels also have fixed procedures for minimising, 

collecting, storing, processing and disposing of garbage. This is 

part of our obligations under Annex V of the International 

Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. We 

also have a strict prohibition of the discharge of any and all 

garbage into the sea, except as provided under Annex V of the 

Convention.

Some of the key statistics of our effluent and waste management efforts are set out below.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 14 | P a g e 

 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ASSOCIATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS  

Although international shipping is the most efficient mode of mass transport and only contributes modestly 

to overall carbon dioxide emissions, SSC recognises that we must play our part to further improve our 

energy efficiency and effective emission control. This will allow us to become more competitive by 

increasing our cost efficiencies. We set out a few examples of our recent efforts at improving this aspect of 

our sustainability initiatives.   

 

Policies and Practices 

In accordance with international standards, SSC has progressively 

implemented data collection systems in our vessels and marine 

operations so that we can monitor fuel oil and energy consumption. This 

is part of our ship energy efficiency management plan, which contains 

a description of the manner in which such data is collected. This allows 

us to make incremental steps to improve our energy efficiency and 

reduce GHG emissions.  

Through the 4-step process laid out in our internal energy management 

policy, we continuously seek new ways to improve our ship energy 

management. Recent key features of the energy management policy 

that have been identified after consultation with our stakeholders for 

further consideration and adoption include: 

 

Hull Monitoring and Maintenance;  

 

Propulsion system maintenance; 

 

Optimised ship and cargo management process; 

 

Records and feedback to shipowners;  

 

Waste Heat Recovery Methods; and 

 

Weather Routing.  

These features will be considered independently for each of our vessels 

since all our ships operate in different environs and conditions. The 

primary objective of these considerations is to improve overall operating 

efficiency of our vessels in the long term by implementing correct and 

optimised methods of energy and fuel conservation.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 






 

 

 

 

 15 | P a g e 

 

Save for our ship management arm, SSC’s main form of fuel consumption is gasoline or diesel oil. We 

disclose below some of the key statistics relating to our Company’s overall energy consumption. Our fuel 

consumption and carbon emissions have increased primarily due to the changes in our vessels’ travel 

patterns in FY2019.  

Scope 1 covers all direct GHG emissions of tonnes of CO2 equivalent by the Group from fuel consumption 

of our ship and calculated using the emission factor approach1.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  

Evolving international and regional environmental policies are driving stricter requirements for vessel 

efficiency and environmental performance. Due to the global nature of the maritime industry in which SSC 

plies its trade, our vessels are subject to the requirements of international regulatory bodies such as the 

International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as well as other local shipping port, coastal authorities, flag-state 

administrations and other regional governing bodies.  

Therefore, to ensure that SSC can continue to operate confidently and securely all around the world, we 

emphasize regulatory compliance and adhering strictly to the relevant laws and regulations. We set out 

below recent developments in our key policies and practices that allow us to maintain our high standards 

of our products and services.  

 

Policies and Practices  

Our Human Resources department has updated Singapore 

employees’ pay structure to align itself with recent changes to the 

Singapore Employment Act, specifically entitlements to overtime 

pay.   

SSC is also committed to ensuring the safety of our operations which 

is achieved through a comprehensive Risk Assessment process that 

is undertaken before and after all operations. This includes a detailed 

checklist which sets out the specifics of the steps that our operations 

teams undertake to ensure safety and quality of our services, and 

that that our operations meet the requirements of the International 

Ship Management Code. This detailed Risk Assessment procedure 

takes a top-down approach, requiring the participation of operational 

general managers, team leaders, members and all other members 

involved in the operations to ensure that everyone is well aware of 

the correct procedures and processes.   

Both internal and external audits (by, for example, Lloyd’s Register) 

continue to be carried out on a regular basis as part of the checks 

and balances put in place to guarantee compliance with the SSC’s 

processes and practices designed to achieve 100% regulatory 

compliance.  

 

For FY 2019, SSC has maintained its zero-incident record with no breaches of safety or environmental 

regulations or any major safety incidents across our portfolio. SSC continues to strictly adhere to 

international environmental laws such as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from 

Ships Convention. To this end, our ships have maintained their certification for, among others, the 

International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate, the International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate and 

the International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate.

EMPLOYEE STATISTICS  

SSC treats all of our employees fairly, and provide them a safe and healthy working environment. We are 

committed to fostering constructive and productive working relationships between management, employees 

and all employee representatives. We also seek to inculcate an embracing culture where employees from 

all walks of lives can contribute to our growth, to their fullest. We reiterate our talent management approach 

that is firmly based on meritocracy, and that no one should be discriminated against because of their 

gender, race or religion.  

We are proud to announce that SSC’s permanent employee demographics have continued to be closely 

aligned with industry standards, having an employee strength of 91 in FY2019. Due to the nature of our 

industry, we continue to be supported by a significant proportion of temporary workers. We set out our 

employee statistics below.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  

SSC is committed to embracing high standards of workplace, safety and health practices. We believe that 

our employees can only work and excel with confidence when we provide them with a safe and inclusive 

working environment.  

  

Our Commitment to our Occupational Health and Safety Laws  

The Group contributes to our employees’ central provident fund 

schemes, and has recently renewed our insurance medical benefits 

such as the hospitalisation &amp; surgical plan for all of our local staff. 

We 

continue 

to 

remain 

updated 

and 

aligned 

with 

all 

recommendations and guidelines issued by the Ministry of 

Manpower of Singapore to ensure that our employees are properly 

protected.  

In addition to the Ministry of Manpower, the maritime industry’s 

operations are guided by the Maritime Port of Authority of 

Singapore and all of the port authorities of the flag states where we 

operate. As such, our operations are audited and heavily 

scrutinised by appointed safety officers, to ensure our working 

environment is conductive and compliant with all practice and safety 

procedures we have set out. 

We have also been progressively increasing awareness for high-

risk health issues as well as enhancing safety measures at 

worksites. We have a standard internal reporting process which 

documents and thoroughly investigates any unlikely injuries or 

illnesses from start to end. This will allow for proper after incident 

assessment so that management can implement preventive 

measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.   

We are pleased to report that there were no major work health 

safety incidents reported for FY2019, allowing us to accomplish our 

target of zero workplace accidents for the year. In addition, SSC 

has maintained a clean record of zero man-hour loss.  






 

 

 

 

 19 | P a g e 

 

TRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT 

Since our Group is labour-intensive and we employ a large number of employees, there is a heavy focus 

on human resource related policies and improving our workforce so that they can exercise their potential 

to their fullest.  

We continue to set aside a fund for our employees to attend courses and seminars to improve their personal 

and work skills, which our employees are encouraged to make use of. Our employees also undergo regular 

performance feedback and guidance during the course of their employment to allow their supervisors to 

highlight areas for improvement and to commend employees where they have excelled.  

For example, to facilitate effective communications between management and employees, we hold in 

regular monthly management meetings where operations matters are discussed in detail for every aspect 

of the office, including information technology and legal matters. We also hold informal small group 

meetings so that management can understand employees’ concerns and grievances.  

In FY2019, we increased our permanent employee staff headcount by 7.2%. During the year, approximately 

75% of the workforce attended training sessions and our employees received at least 42 service training 

hours per employee, including on-site and vocational training.   

 

EMPLOYEE WELLBEING AND ENGAGEMENT 

SLC believes that work can have a strong positive impact on our employees’ physical and psychological 

health. We do our best to involve our employees from all levels in the decision-making processes for the 

Group, and also with positive wellness programs that help to foster a sense of community in the workplace, 

to develop team bonding and good social workplace habits.  

We do this by encouraging our staff to actively participate in activities organised by our recreational 

committee, such as movie screenings, charity runs, team-bonding sessions and festive year-end 

celebrations. Concessions and discounts are provided by the Group to further encourage all staff to 

participate. For example, to create awareness among our employees regarding the importance of health 

and wellness, in August 2019, the Company coordinated an interactive session where we engaged third 

party chiropractic consultants to examine and consult our employees on potential spinal and back issues.   

Similar to FY 2018, we continue to maintain 100% of our full-time employees that have served a full year 

participated in at least one performance or work appraisal during FY2019.

DATA SECURITY AND CUSTOMER PRIVACY 

In line with the Group’s obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, in June 2019, the Group 

issued a comprehensive revised Personal data Protection Policy, which reflects the requirements under the 

Act, regulate how the Group processes personal data of the Group’s employees, officers, shareholders, 

customers and suppliers.  

Among other things, this revised policy provides specific guidelines on the manner in which our employees 

ought to act when handling personal data in the course of business, and to ensure they are informed and 

aware of the steps SLC should take in collecting, using and disclosing personal data. To ensure continuing 

compliance with this internal policy, compliance is subject to internal audit and reporting requirements, 

through which SLC is required to obtain confirmation on an annual basis from data intermediaries and 

internal departments that no breach relating to personal data has occurred over the audit period.  

We are proud to announce that for FY 2019, we have not received any complaints or suffered any breaches 

of our clients’ personal data.
