Chairman’s Welcome Message

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the annual report of Halcyon Agri 

Corporation Limited (“Halcyon Agri”) for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”).

FY2021 was an extraordinary year. The global economy 

grew by 5.9%, gradually recovering from the impacts 

brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 

year, the global logistics disruption and fluctuation of 

commodity prices including natural rubber, have brought 

challenges to the rubber plantations, smallholder 

farmers, producers, and downstream tyre companies.

As the world-leading natural rubber franchise, Halcyon 

Agri has a unique vantage point to the global supply 

and demand dynamics through our global network. 

In FY2021, we have effectively executed our business 

strategy in accordance with our Pillar of 360° Excellence, 

to seize market opportunities and in turn achieved much 

improved results, both financially and operationally. The 

Group registered a net profit of US$17.0 million in FY2021, 

from a net loss of US$60.6 million in FY2020.

Our sales volume increased 15.7% year-on-year (“YoY”), 

to 1,372,241 mT in FY2021. Our revenue surged 44.0% 

YoY to US$2.45 billion while our gross profit increased 

from US$101.6 million in FY2020 to US$162.9 million in 

FY2021, on the back of higher volume and better margins. 

We registered EBITDA of US$69.3 million in FY2021, from 

US$1.8 million reported in the prior year.

Building on Customer Excellence, we have further 

strengthened our position as a preferred natural rubber 

supplier as we collaborated closely with customers 

to support their supply chain management and have 

effectively optimised our global production capacity. 

Our production volume was 869,699 mT, an increase of 

10% from 787,762 mT in FY2020. Despite the global supply 

chain disruption, our strategically located factories around 

the world enabled us to serve our customers in a timely 

and cost-effective manner. This is the foundation to build a 

strong and lasting relationship with our customers.

We constantly embrace innovative solutions. In March 

2021, our pioneer digitalisation initiative, HeveaConnect, 

has secured a US$1.5 million investment from Singapore 

Exchange. This has effectively boosted HeveaConnect’s 

industry traction, facilitated the onboarding of producers 

and major global tyre customers, which accelerated 

industry digitalisation along the natural rubber supply 

chain based on sustainable business practices.

Sustainable development is core tenet of our business. 

We continuously strengthen the quality of HeveaPro 

sustainable rubber and strive to create green and low-

carbon competitive advantages. 

各位股东、客户以及合作伙伴：

大家好。

欢迎您阅读合盛集团2021年度报告。

2021年是极其不平凡的一年，全球经济从新冠肺炎疫

情的巨大冲击中逐步艰难恢复，GDP实现了5.9%的增

长–尤其中国，在沉着应对百年未有之变局和新冠疫

情挑战之际，实现了8.1%的GDP增长。在今年，全球

供应链中断包括天然橡胶在内的大宗商品价格大幅波

年6,060万美元的净亏损。

合盛集团2021财年销量同比增长15.7%，达到1,372,241

及摊销前利润（“EBITDA”）为6,932万美元，较上一

年有显著的增长。

我们强化“客户导向”，贴近市场，聚焦内涵式发展，

充分优化提升集团的全球生产能力。本集团2021财年

的生产量为869,699吨，比2020财年的787,762吨增加了

10.0%。尽管全球供应链中断，本集团位于世界各地的

工厂为集团赋予了战略性的优势，使我们能够为客户

提供即时和节约成本的服务，为牢固持久的客户关系

奠定了良好基础。

我们坚信“持续创新”，不断创新发展思路。集团

HeveaConnect的行业吸引力，促进了生产商和全球重

Our sustainability track record has been recognised by 

reputable organisations, including:

1. Ranked as the most transparent rubber producing 

company in 2021 SPOTT assessment, by the 

Zoological Society of London; 

2. Awarded EcoVadis Gold Medal (2020); 

3. As a member of the Global Platform for Sustainable 

Natural Rubber (“GPSNR”), we have fully aligned our 

Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy to 

the policy framework of GPSNR.

We continue to establish meaningful relationships with 

our partners in realising mutual growth.

In April 2021, we have completed a significant long-term 

financing of US$300 million. This reflects the continued 

trust in our business model. Our balance sheet structure 

is effectively strengthened and this enabled us to 

navigate the challenges in the post-pandemic economy 

and capture market opportunities which may arise. 

Sinochem, our major shareholder has also provided 

strong support in our value creation initiatives.

Looking ahead in FY2022, the macroeconomic outlook 

remains optimistic despite uncertainties surrounding 

the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 

pandemic, and the impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

2022 GDP growth estimates by the Organization for 

Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) 

and International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) stand at 4.5% 

and 4.4% respectively, while China’s 2022 GDP growth 

estimate is 5.5%. Other than the GDP growth, the near 

term demand for natural rubber could be boosted by 

the progressive reopening measures by countries 

around the world. We maintain our view that the long-

term supply and demand dynamics of natural rubber 

remain favourable to us.

In FY2022, we will continue to pursue excellence to 

achieve sustainable growth, following our prior year’s 

motto of “Innovate, Sustain, Succeed”. We spare no 

effort to continue our positive momentum to enhance 

our business strategy, focusing on our innovation, in 

seizing market opportunities to further augment our 

business and generate sustainable profits, ultimately 

creating value for our shareholders, employees and 

society.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my 

deepest gratitude to all shareholders, customers, 

bankers and business partners for your support to 

Halcyon Agri during the year. Also, I would like to extend 

my heartfelt appreciation to the management team 

and all employees for your relentless commitment and 

hard work. With our combined efforts, I look forward to 

our continued success in FY2022.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review 

Halcyon Agri at a Glance

Dear Stakeholders, 

It is no doubt that 2021 was a challenging year. As the 

world is recovering from the aftermath effects of COVID-19 

in 2020, the sharp rebound in demand has thrown almost 

every facet of global supply chain into a tailspin, spurring 

port congestion, shipment delays and causing shortages 

of almost everything. The emergence of new COVID-19 

variants has also affected the pace of economic recovery. 

As a result, global economy, including the commodity 

market, continued to be volatile throughout the year.

Exceptional 

times 

call 

for 

exceptional 

measures. 

Halcyon Agri’s global team has been stepping up the 

efforts to formulate the optimal solutions that best 

serve our customers amid the surge in demand and 

logistical challenges, and turns valuable resources and 

relationships into tangible results that create value for 

the Company’s stakeholders. 

Being a world-leading natural rubber producer, we 

have a unique vantage point to the global supply and 

demand dynamics. Leveraging on our global integration 

capabilities and regional footprint with strategically 

located factories, we have mobilised our global resources 

effectively to provide value-added services and high-

quality products to our customers in a timely and cost-

effective manner.

This has allowed the Group to build and grow our strength 

and resilience, despite the adversities. 

Vision and Pillar of 360° Excellence

During the year, we have formalised the Group’s Vision 

Statement to state our ultimate goal as a responsible 

organisation and be a leading corporate citizen. 

Halcyon Agri’s performance in 2021 is a testament of our 

successful implementation of the four key features in Our 

Pillar of 360° Excellence, being Customer Excellence, 

Operational Excellence, Financial Excellence and 

Corporate Excellence.

Customer Excellence – We capitalised on our global 

presence and have further strengthened our position as 

a preferred natural rubber supplier. Our global presence 

and vertical capabilities meant that we can meet our 

customers’ sourcing and logistic needs on a timely basis, 

which is especially critical amid global shipping logjam. 

These competitive advantages have placed us in pole 

position to benefit from the strong demand recovery 

in both tyre and non-tyre sectors. As of 2021, Halcyon 

Agri produces and/or distributes 10% of natural rubber 

consumed globally.

Operational Excellence – Our global operations have 

striven to maximise operating efficiency to enhance 

our competitiveness. In doing so, we have strategically 

deployed our global resources to ensure our factory 

generate higher contribution margins, and improve the 

fixed costs absorption rate. At the same time, we also 

dived deep into our processes to identify opportunities 

for improvement, and refine them accordingly. As a result 

of the team’s relentless efforts, cost efficiencies have 

improved amid the 10% increase in the Group’s global 

production volumes to 869,699 mT in FY2021. Separately, 

the improvements introduced to the plantation business 

and operational process in 2021 have also produced 

better results, as evidenced by the increase in tapping 

efficiency and higher yields.

Financial Excellence – With strong support from 

institutional stakeholders and our major shareholder, 

Sinochem, our stronger capital footing has allowed us 

to capitalise on market opportunities to generate better 

financial returns. Our capital allocation tactic is consistent 

with Operational Excellence, where we allocate capital to 

business unit based on its merits and potential returns. 

This is especially crucial in a volatile market environment. 

Our capital management strategy has seen our working 

capital days reduced from 114 days in 2020 to 86 days 

in 2021. We have also made good progress on our 

deleveraging plan throughout 2021, and it is one of the 

top priorities of my management team for 2022.

Corporate Excellence – We aim to achieve sustainable 

and profitable organic growth through sustainability, 

innovation and strong execution.

 

As we strive to deliver sustainable profits, we also aim 

to establish ourselves as a leading corporate citizen – 

To generate sustainable returns to our shareholders, to 

reward our dedicated employees fairly and meaningfully, 

and to ensure that small communities can prosper in this 

global competitive environment.

OUR VISION is to be the leading 

natural rubber global franchise, 

leveraging our globally integrated 

platform in advocating for ESG 

practices across the supply chain, 

and effecting meaningful change in 

the industry.

A leading provider of specialist polymers for industrial and non-tyre applications, CMC Group operates a wide storefront 

covering in-house plantation rubber and concentrated latex, as well as third-party sourced natural and synthetic rubber, 

in both dry and liquid forms. CMC comprises of two units: CMC Plantations (CMCP) and CMC International (CMCI). 

Each business unit has different characteristics and profit drivers. Effective FY2021, the financial reporting segment has 

been modified to provide better clarity on the operation of each business.

CMC Plantations (CMCP)

With over 31,400 ha planted in Cameroon and 7,000 ha planted in Malaysia, CMCP is the owner of one of the largest 

commercially owned and operated rubber plantations. However, CMCP’s average tree profile is largely immature. The 

plantation business is a long-term investment as each planted rubber tree takes an average of five to seven years before 

yielding the first drop of latex, and will go on to be productive for the next 30 years. As the plantation overheads are 

mostly fixed in nature, the time passage will lead to the ramping up of plantation yields and improving the absorption 

of fixed costs.

Moving forward, as the immature areas come on stream and the yields of the younger trees strengthen, the plantation 

output is expected to at least double in the next five years, and reach 55,000 mT of output by 2030. As the unit costs are 

reduced with a larger volume base, unit profits will increase. There is further upside profit potential when factoring in 

the cyclical recovery in rubber prices.

CMC International (CMCI)

Being a fulfillment platform, CMCI operates commercial and distribution platforms with global third-party procurement 

capability. CMCI is the distribution arm for our plantation outputs, which allows us to capture the whole supply chain 

margin from the tree all the way to the customers’ door. It is also a stockist and merchandiser, equipped with storage 

capability that supports the customers requirements by providing a full suite of logistics and technical services. The 

distribution margins are used to support the development and maintenance costs of our plantations. 

Digitalisation Initiatives

On top of the above two major business segments, Halcyon Agri also invests in the digital transformation of the natural 

rubber supply chain, the most prominent initiative being HeveaConnect. HeveaConnect is a digital marketplace for 

sustainably produced natural rubber, and is at the forefront of the digitalisation of the natural rubber industry. Digital 

transformation allows for data transparency, which will strengthen the integrity of product sustainability, and enhances 

trust along supply chain.

Board of Directors

Chief Executive Officer’s Review

Reflecting upon our focus in previous year, which is 

“Innovate, Sustain, Succeed”, I’m proud to say that we 

have achieved our 2021 aspirations. However, the work 

does not stop here. Our ambition is to build on our strong 

foundation, to scale greater heights which is - “Towards 

Excellence and Sustained Growth”.

Outlook for FY2022

Macro-economic outlook is expected to remain upbeat, 

with 2022 GDP growth estimates by OECD and IMF stands 

at 4.5% and 4.4% respectively. It is also foreseen that 

the recent spike in crude oil prices might spark a switch 

from the usage of synthetic rubber to natural rubber 

amongst the downstream players, to the extent it is 

interchangeable.

However, the pace and momentum of the demand 

recovery could be disrupted by a number of headwind 

factors: (i) potential new variants of COVID-19; (ii) ongoing 

global supply chain constraints and logistics disruptions; 

(iii) the development of Russia-Ukraine conflict; (iv) 

stagflation in the developed countries; and (v) the 

volatility of global forex rates.

Amidst the overall upbeat view, we remain cautiously 

optimistic towards 2022.

While there might be a myriad of short and medium term 

factors which might affect the natural rubber industry 

in near future, Halcyon Agri as a natural rubber supply 

chain manager, focuses on long-term industry prospects.

2021 natural rubber consumption returned to pre-

COVID levels, and is expected to grow at 3% per annum 

moving forward, in line with the long-term GDP growth 

projections. However, these figures may have been 

conservative, as it might not have considered the effects 

of the emerging trends such as heightened sustainability 

requirement, electrification of vehicles and healthcare 

evolution. 

1 Source: World Rubber Industry Outlook, IRSG.

On the other hand, over the past seven years, the new 

rubber planting areas have been declining, presumably 

due 

to 

prolonged 

low-price 

environment, 

which 

disincentivises the smallholder farmers to remain in 

the rubber industry. For context, natural rubber is a 

smallholder-centric product, thus price movement has 

direct impact to their livelihood.

The other pertinent fact is the gestation period of rubber 

trees, which is about five to seven years after the trees 

are planted. Even we are to engage in mass planting of 

rubber trees right now, the trees are not going to be 

productive anytime soon. Hence, the growth rate of the 

supply might not catch up with the growth in demand in 

the near future.

Concluding thoughts

Heading into 2022, we spare no effort to maintain 

positive growth momentum and achieve 360° Excellence. 

We will continue to capitalise on market opportunities to 

further augment our business, and generate sustainable 

profits. We also aim to speed up our deleveraging plan, to 

improve our liquidity and capital structure.

I want to state our continuing support and determination 

to realise the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals and United Nations’ Global Compact (UNGC) 

principles on human rights, labour, environment and 

anti-corruption for all our stakeholders.

In closing, I would like to commend the efforts of the 

members of Halcyon Agri family for their unwavering 

dedication and commitment in ensuring that the Group 

is moving ahead in unison towards the right direction. 

I also would like to extend my sincerest appreciation to 

our Board of Directors, our financiers, our commercial 

partners and all other stakeholders for your steadfast 

support. With your continued faith and trust in Halcyon 

Agri, I am excited to take on 2022.

Rubber Market Notes

Senior Management



OVERVIEW FOR 2021

After the global upheaval suffered in 2020 due to 

COVID-19, 2021 started upbeat. A release of pent up 

demand following gradual easing of lockdown measures 

since the second half of 2020, and massive stimulus by 

central banks around the world, has spurred a strong 

economic recovery throughout the most part of 2021. 

However, it was somewhat dampened by the uncertainties 

created by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and 

the uneven pace of vaccination rollout globally.

The current global logistics infrastructure was insufficient 

to cater for the sudden surge in demand driven by flushed 

liquidity, which clogged up the container flows and supply 

chains, sending global freight rates skyrocketing. The 

signs were all there - the six-day blockage of Suez Canal 

by Ever Given in March 2021 merely brought the issue to 

global attention. 

Linking this back to the natural rubber industry, while 

the surge in freight rates did not affect our profitability 

directly as we sell mostly on Freight-on-Board (“FOB”) 

basis to our customers, the shipment delays due to 

container shortage has resulted in a marginal increase in 

the inventory holding costs.

All in all, despite the challenges, global natural rubber 

consumption in 2021 has increased 9.4% to 13.8 million 

mT1 to continue its growth path pre-COVID.

On the other hand, the supply of natural rubber was 

affected throughout the year by recurring COVID-19 

lockdowns imposed by governments, which affected 

the overall tapping rates and factory operating rates. 

The continuing cross-border controls and movement 

restrictions have left the harvesting and processing 

sectors undermanned for long periods – this is especially 

prevalent for Indonesia and Malaysia.

Stage 1 — Due to the pandemic, the strong demand 

for field latex has driven prices up, causing the spread 

between dry rubber and latex to increase. Concurrently, 

the warning signs of the logistics disruption has fuelled 

expectations that the deliverable contracts will be much 

than anticipated, which is normally taken as a bullish 

signal. As a result, fund money flowed into the SHFE WF 

contracts, sending it to a 3.5-year high. 

Stage 2 — The excess capacity for nitrile latex, due to an 

over-investment at the onset of the pandemic, as well 

as the improvement in overseas rubber imports have 

caused the SHFE WF contract prices enter into correction 

territory. As a result, the global natural rubber prices 

were sluggish during the period.

Stage 3 — Two pronounced factors caused the prices to 

be on a range-moving pattern: (i) On a macro level, the 

rumoured interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve 

has placed a downward pressure on the commodities 

industry; (ii) On a micro level, the continued disruption 

of supply chain infrastructure has caused a shortage of 

natural rubber, and the domestic players had to draw 

down from the stockpile to fulfil the demand recovery. 

The range-moving patterns holds through the first two 

months of 2022.

One of the key topics, if not the most, in the natural 

rubber industry in 2021, surrounds China’s destocking of 

its natural rubber stockpile. For context, natural rubber is 

one of the strategic materials for China, and it is by far the 

largest natural rubber consuming nation. Hence, it is not 

unexpected that the country keeps a comparatively high 

natural rubber stockpile.

The below chart summarises the movement of the 

Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) WF main contracts 

throughout the year. This is an indicator that a majority 

of natural rubber participants observe, mainly due to 

two factors: (i) China is world’s largest natural rubber 

consuming nation; (ii) SHFE WF is the most liquid rubber 

futures and often influences the movement of related 

rubber futures in Singapore (SICOM) and Japan (TOCOM).

Despite the stable operating rates in factories and the 

logistical congestion situation, China is exporting more 

tyres than ever, an indication of the strong automotive 

demand globally. Hence, China is drawing down from 

inventories to fulfil the surging demand, which caused 

overall stock level to continue dropping. They are now 

running on much lower stock reserves - equivalent to one 

month of domestic consumption as of now, more than 

halved from a year-ago period. 

The recent increase in inventory balances to-date in 2022 

could be a signal for the beginning of China’s restocking 

exercise. However, as the usual sources which sell to 

China have diverted their products to the international 

markets, the remaining available supply might be 

insufficient to fulfill the restocking requirement of China.

OUTLOOK FOR 2022

What to expect from natural rubber in 2022? While 

difficult to nail down, judging from the trends, we suspect 

there will be stock depletion at both ends, origin and end-

user. This is caused by the longer lead time from tree to 

product. As such, the inventory management policies of 

the businesses in destination markets have become “just-

in-case”, instead of “just-in-time”. 

It is anticipated that the further stepping up of economic 

reopening measures will boost the demand for the 

natural rubber, and the lifting of movement restriction 

means that more tappers will be able to return to work, 

providing some uplift to the supply. However, the supply 

recovery is expected to be gradual due to persistent 

supply chain constraint and labour shortages.

The most recent Russia-Ukraine conflict has driven a 

substantial increase in crude oil prices, with Russia being 

the world’s second largest exporter of the commodity. 

As a result, synthetic rubber (styrene-butadiene rubber, 

nitrile etc) prices have spiked in tandem. This prompted 

the international tyre makers to switch where possible 

their formulas to use more natural rubber as compared 

to synthetic rubber, in order to contain the overall cost 

increase. Demand from Europe and United States tyre-

makers remains relatively strong in 2022.

Separately, the evolution in healthcare industry post-

pandemic will also drive the consumption of natural 

rubber, particularly latex-grades, which are typically used 

in protective materials such as gloves, masks and tubes.

Overall, we anticipate the aforementioned factors will 

keep the natural rubber prices buoyed for 2022. Long-

term supply-demand dynamics remain favourable.

Two words epitomise the Group’s FY2021 financial 

performance: Strong Recovery. Amid the gradual recovery 

of global economy and supply chain disruption in FY2021, 

the Group has taken active steps in navigating the 

challenges and capture market opportunities to achieve 

a substantial improvement in results. At the same time, 

the Group further strengthened its strategic foothold and 

capital structure to capture future opportunities.

• US$17.0 million net profit. Despite the global supply 

chain disruption, the Group’s globally integrated 

operations enabled us to serve the customers in a 

timely and cost-effective manner, which facilitates the 

margin expansion. Plantation losses have narrowed as 

well due to higher yields from maturing plantations, 

realisation of latex premium in selling prices, and 

conscious cost management. The Group reported a 

net profit of US$17.0 million, from a US$60.6million 

net loss in FY2020.

• Effective working capital management. Amid 

the prevailing operating environment, maintaining 

sufficient operating liquidity is critical to maintain the 

Group’s competitiveness. The Group has exercised 

prudence in capital allocation and working capital 

management, and achieved a reduction in working 

capital days from 114 days in FY2020 to 86 days in 

FY2021.

• Unlocking value of non-core assets. Our ongoing 

deleveraging plan has also yielded positive results. The 

successful disposal of certain non-core assets raised 

US$7.4 million in FY2021, with remaining amounts be 

received in FY2022 upon completion of the disposal 

transactions. The Group continues to focus on 

opportunistic disposal of the portfolio of non-core 

assets to unlock its value, and realise cash to reduce 

our group-wide gearing.

• Completion of a significant long-term financing 

of US$300 million with a syndicate of Chinese 

banks. The successful refinancing of incumbent loan 

has strengthened the Group’s capital structure and 

improve our operating liquidity.

• Maximise shareholders’ value. On March 2021, 

HeveaConnect Pte. Ltd. has secured a US$1.5 million 

investment from Singapore Exchange. As part of the 

transaction, the Group ceded its controlling stake by 

transferring c.15% of its stake to HeveaConnect Equity 

Trust. This move is in line with our strategic direction 

to own a non-controlling stake in a substantially more 

valuable company. The de-consolidation at a sizeable 

uplift in enterprise value since our initial investment 

resulted in a US$7.6 million of gain of deemed disposal. 

• Enhanced the transparency of our business 

reporting. In cognisance of drastically different 

business models of the plantation and distribution 

operations, the Group has improvised its segmental 

reporting to segregate the financial results of CMC 

Plantations and CMC International in FY2021. We 

believe that this change provides further clarity on the 

profit drivers of our business improves transparency of 

financial disclosure, and at the same time, highlight the 

efforts of our plantation team in improving the results. 

Up until FY2020, both segments are consolidated 

under CMC Group.

Financial Highlights

Financial Highlights



























































Net Financing Cost

Working capital financing costs comprise entirely the 

interest expenses incurred for the funding of the Group’s 

working capital turnover. Meanwhile, fixed capital 

financing costs represent the net costs from structural 

financing facilities that include term debt interests as well 

as financing income.

Net financing costs decreased by 23.2% from US$25.4 

million in FY2020 to US$19.5 million in FY2021, driven by 

the lower global benchmark interest rates, as well as the 

availability of perpetual securities, for which its annual 

distribution of US$7.6 million is categorised as an equity 

outflow. However, this was set off by higher utilisation of 

short term facilities to fund working capital investments, 

due to higher prices and improved demand.

CMC Plantations (CMCP)

Majority of CMCP’s plantations are currently in gestation 

phase and continued investments are required to 

nurture the plantations to reach maturity. During 

FY2021, CMCP recorded a biological asset fair value 

uplift of US$6.8 million as compared to US$3.5 million in 

FY2020 which reflects an improved value of the Group’s 

investment in the plantations. Excluding the said fair 

value gain, the operating loss has narrowed down to 

US$13.3 million in FY2021 from US$32.1 million in 

FY2020 despite the increase in the operating costs from 

the increase in mature areas due to better profitability 

from higher selling prices and better yields.

CMC International (CMCI)

CMCI tapped on its effective supply chain management 

strategies and entrenched customer relationships amid 

the global supply chain disruption, and recorded a 

marginal increase in sales volume. Gross profit more than 

doubled from FY2020, driven by the surge in demand 

for domestically stocked natural rubber and latex. As a 

result, operating profits surged to US$26.8 million in 

FY2021, from breakeven in FY2020.

Corporate

The segment covers the key administrative and support 

functions of Group. Operating losses decreased from 

US$16.4 million in FY2020 to US$8.5 million in FY2021, 

mainly due to higher issuance costs of reported securities 

and the syndicated financing, from a perpetual lower base 

in FY2020. The Group continues to seek cost efficiency 

amid a challenging operating environment.

Sales Volume

Sales volume increased c.16% from FY2020 to FY2021, as 

the Group captured opportunities along the downstream

(13.7)

 

The Group’s net assets have reduced from US$749.1 million in December 2020 to US$724.2 million in December 2021. 

The key reason of the reduction is due to the translation loss from foreign operations and distribution to perpetual 

securities holders, set off by the net profit for the year. 

The Group continues to maintain a stable funding base, where financing tenors are matched, cash balances are 

unencumbered and fixed assets are sustainably financed.

Working capital funding efficiency increased to 83.1%, mainly driven by utilisation of higher working capital loans at 

year end, in line with the increase in rubber prices and high volumes to meet the demands in 2022.

Fixed asset gearing decreased from 50.3% in December 2020 to 45.2% in December 2021, mainly due to increase in 

asset base due to continuous investment into immature upkeep across our plantation platform.

Operating cash flows

Operating cash flows before working capital changes 

increased from US$28.0 million in 2020 to US$40.4 

million in FY2021, reflecting cash-generating capabilities 

of the Group’s core operations. Due to the effect of 

higher prices and stronger demand, the cash flows from 

operations have to be reinvested into working capital, 

and further supplemented by short term loans. However, 

the Group’s effective working capital cycle management 

has contained the increase in net cash used in operating 

activities at US$33.6 million for FY2021. 

Investing cash flows

Net cash used in investing activities have decreased, from 

US$38.6 million in FY2020 to US$18.7 million in FY2021, 

due to lower capital expenditures as well as the proceeds 

from disposal of non-core assets of US$7.3 million. For 

context, included within the net cash flow used in investing 

activities are capital expenditures of US$28.1 million and 

US$34.4 million in FY2021 and FY2020 respectively.

Financing cash flows

Net cash generated from financing activities has 

increased from US$26.4 million in the previous year to 

US$41.8 million in the current year, mainly due to net 

proceeds from borrowings of US$85.1 million to support 

the group’s working capital requirements, as explained 

above. It should be noted that net working capital is self-

liquidating in nature, and the proceeds from liquidation 

of working capital will be used to repay the short-term 

loans after around 90 days of cash conversion cycle.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT

Treasury management

Treasury management is carried out by the business 

units, and coordinated by group treasury, in accordance 

with established policies and guidelines. Policies and 

guidelines have been regularly updated to take into 

account changes in the operating environment. Working 

capital requirements and capital expenditures are funded 

by a mix of short-term and long- term loans.

We closely monitor relevant emerging regulations, 

which may potentially impact the way that we obtain our 

finances or introduce any operating constraints. We are 

kept updated of the latest development in debt markets 

and to arrange new financing as opportunities arise. Our 

consistent approach has helped us in building a strong 

working relationship with the bankers.

Cash and cash equivalents, as well as undrawn committed 

facilities, are available for drawdown at short notice.  

Financing profile

Halcyon has access to different sources of financing. We 

decide on the financing approach that is best suited for 

our prevailing business needs, bearing in mind the risk 

of concentration. Hence, we have a diversified source of 

financing and borrow on both secured and unsecured 

basis.

As of 31 December 2021, the Group had total bank 

borrowings of US$1,086.9 million, comprising:

Working capital loans of US$601.8 million (55%): These 

are mainly related to the financing of working capital 

turn, in which the cash conversion cycle typically takes a 

lead time of c.90 days. 

Term loans of US$485.1 million (45%): These loans 

typically bear a repayment tenor of more than one year, 

and drawn to finance our investments into factory assets 

and plantations. 

 

Capital management

In managing our capital structure, we aim to find the 

right balance between shareholders’ funds and external 

borrowings in order to maximise shareholder returns.

In achieving the optimal capital structure, we may either 

renew and refinance existing borrowings, obtain new 

borrowings, or deleverage by way of equity issuance, 

capital raise at subsidiaries level, as well as opportunistic 

disposal of non-core assets.

Having access to flexible and cost-effective financing 

allows us to quickly respond to opportunities. In our view, 

the Group has adequate sources of financing to meet 

our business requirement in the foreseeable future. 

We also use a combination of short-term and long-term 

debts in financing our operations, depending on the 

cash flow profile of the prevailing investments. Most of 

our drawdowns are in US dollars, being the underlying 

currency of natural rubber trades.

HALCYON RUBBER COMPANY (HRC)

As the pre-eminent supplier of natural rubber to the 

global fraternity, HRC has 35 factories located across 

major rubber origins, and produce sustainable natural 

rubber under the proprietary HeveaPro brand. Its global 

scale and reach places it at the pole position to reap 

benefits from the demand recovery following the global 

easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. 

On top of that, HRC also have distribution units at 

strategic locations to facilitate the distribution of both 

HeveaPro and third-party products. Together with its 

distribution volumes, to which mainly targeted to China 

market, HRC achieved a combined sales volume of 1.06 

million mT across its global operations.

As demand recovery gains momentum over 2021, sales 

volume returned to pre-pandemic levels. The strong 

influx of orders has pushed the rubber prices to a higher 

level during the year. Notwithstanding the bullish factors, 

the natural rubber industry has been facing certain 

headwinds during the year:

• Supply chain disruption: The COVID-19 pandemic 

triggered global manufacturing slowdown, which 

affected global economic activity. As the world swung 

back to higher levels of economic activity in late 2020 

at a pace that the global freight transport system 

could not cope with, supply chains were disrupted 

and resulted in a worldwide logistics logjam. This had 

a pronounced and ongoing impact to the transit time 

and freight cost.

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of the natural rubber to global mobility and transportation 

(tyres), to household and healthcare applications (gloves, tubes etc). Natural rubber is essentially needed in every 

aspect of our day-to-day lives. 

Natural rubber in its raw form, is in liquid latex harvested from rubber trees, Hevea brasiliensis. These are then put 

through a series conversion processes, by mid-stream processers like Halcyon Agri, to facilitate the production into end 

products that is used by the consumers. Halcyon Agri’s integrated global network gives us control over the entire value 

chain.

In this section, we share a bit more insights in our global operations which played a major part in ensuring the timely 

production and delivery of this critical raw material to its users.

• Manpower shortage: The trend that smallholders 

leave rubber farming and switch to crops with better 

returns or engages in non-agricultural activities, has 

led to a surge in demand for foreign workers for 

rubber tapping. The border restrictions imposed in the 

countries where the Group operates, have worsened 

the longstanding manpower crunch in the rubber 

tapping activities, and exacerbated supply scarcity. 

• COVID-19 effects: The production activities of both 

ours and our customers’ factories were heavily 

disrupted by recurring shutdown orders during 2021, 

as part of lockdowns imposed by local governments 

to curb the spike in COVID-19 infections. However, the 

situation has improved towards the end of the year 

following the increase in vaccination rates, as well as 

the government’s commitment to step up the opening 

of economy.

Demand: Market Review

International market: The reopening measures in 

United States and Europe have boosted the demand 

for private cars due to safety considerations. The surge 

in both OEM2 and replacement tyres have resulted in 

international tyremakers ramping up their production 

volumes, and seen their manufacturing plants running at 

full capacity.  Out of the 1.06 million mT sold by HRC in 

2021, a sizeable portion has been sold to international 

tyre makers, which boasts household tyre brands such 

as Bridgestone, Michelin, Goodyear and Continental 

amongst others. The strong downstream demand, 

coupled with supply chain pressure (such as high 

freight costs, delivery delays, high material prices), have 

prompted the tyre majors to increase their selling prices 

multiple times over the past 12 months.

China market: The Chinese tyremakers faced similar 

situation as their international counterparts during 2021.

However, the effect is less pronounced as the tyremakers 

are drawing down the natural rubber inventories from 

their bonded warehouses, to supplement the lack of 

imports. That said, inventory build up has been observed 

at factories due to the lack of containers shipping the 

tyres to the regular consumption market. The sky-high

preventive maintenance windows

freight costs situation has rendered the China-produced 

tyres, which are historically cheaper, to be no longer 

competitive. To give an analogy, one TEU (twenty-foot 

equivalent unit container) with 24 mT load capacity 

shipping TSR3 is more cost-competitive than shipping 

tyres of equivalent weight. 

It is worth noting that substantial majority of the natural 

rubber produced globally, about 85-90%, comes from 

smallholder farmers, for which the price elasticity is 

less apparent as it ties to their livelihood. As such, our 

processing margins would very much dependent on raw 

material availability regardless of price levels, as well as 

the realised selling prices. 

As a rubber processor, our selling prices are mainly 

dictated by futures prices (SICOM, SHFE or INE4), which 

may not reflect the true cost of production in producing 

countries. This is especially true in Indonesia, whereby 

the raw material prices diverged from the traditional 

SICOM futures prices. As a result, our LTC prices, which 

is usually benchmarked against average SICOM prices of 

preceding month, suffered. On the other hand, during 

the year, we see that spot physical prices achieved almost 

US$180 above SICOM level on a per mT basis, which is 

a rare instance. Such anomaly indicates serious supply 

condition in Indonesia.

Indonesia being the second largest natural rubber 

producing nation, is now at crossroads with respect of 

its future place in the natural rubber landscape, with 

persistently low rubber prices in the past ten years, 

caused underinvestment in maintaining the existing 

rubber plantation areas, and a decline in future supply.  

If this situation persists, we foresee there might be a 

tipping point in the domestic landscape, whereby smaller 

producers will be phased out gradually due to financial 

weakness, until a point where raw materials availability 

in Indonesia eventually be matched with production 

capacity, reaching an equilibrium.

In Thailand, as certain producers faced financial 

pressures and lost competitiveness, competition for raw 

materials are now less intense, which facilitated better 

processing margins. At the same time, with the slowdown 

in buying from China due to aforementioned factors, the 

Thai rubber producers are able to channel their products 

to the international market, which normally commands a 

higher sales premium.

Ivory Coast is an up and coming region with the potential 

to be one of the top natural rubber origins in near future. 

As of 2021, they are already the world’s fourth largest 

natural rubber producing nation, after Thailand, Indonesia 

and Vietnam. Close proximity to Europe and United 

States accords the nation with logistical advantage, as 

the shipping costs from Africa is considerably cheaper as 

compared to shipping from Asia. Furthermore, the local 

government’s efforts in promoting rubber planting as a 

source of stable income, has led to an abundance of raw 

materials now, which offers a lot of growth opportunities.

Our global presence meant that we are poised to 

capitalise on opportunities by bringing raw materials from 

one country to another to improve production levels (e.g. 

our factories in Southeast Asia can import raw materials 

from neighbouring countries or West/Central Africa, as 

and when opportunities arise). This allows us to manage 

our group-wide raw material intake costs, increase our 

factories utilisation and optimise our production costs 

globally.

Key Priorities 

The key priorities moving ahead encompass the following: 

Quality, Efficiency and Sustainability. 

Quality is our way of life, as we continue to embrace 

HeveaPro Industrial Standards as guiding principles for 

production of sustainable natural rubber. Simultaneously, 

HRC prioritises efficiency by consistently benchmarking 

the efficiency of our operations, not only with our 

competitors, but also amongst intra-group factories, to 

identify opportunities for improvement. Finally, in line 

with the Halcyon Agri Group’s principle that sustainability 

being a core business tenet, HRC will continue to enhance 

its ESG capability and performance.

HRC Group with 35 factories strategically located across 5 countries, produces 

high quality natural rubber for our customers, which is one of the key 

strengths for Halcyon Agri. With our business closely related to smallholders 

in developing countries, we believe ESG is an area of importance in the 

future to ensure smallholders have sustainable income and every natural 

rubber producer have sustainable profits, while ensuring that society and 

environment are being protected.

CMC INTERNATIONAL (CMCI)

CMCI has long prided itself on its entrenched position in 

key sourcing markets.  Equipped with a globally diversified 

distribution team and logistical assets, CMCI was well 

positioned to operate in this challenging environment. 

Procurement offices in Southeast Asia capitalised on 

the strong relationships with Halcyon Agri’s group-

wide factories and third-party producers to successfully 

procure natural rubber from over 20 origins, despite a 

global scarcity of raw material. The three largest sources 

of supply in 2021 were Thailand (27%), Indonesia (18%) 

and Vietnam (15%).

Distribution offices spanning China, Europe and North 

America, with representatives in Africa and South 

America distributed 310,000 mT of natural rubber and 

latex to over 700 destinations. Our just-in-case strategy 

of holding rubber and latex, facilitated through our global 

network of warehouses and tank instillations, allowed for 

quick delivery to customers who had not anticipated the 

higher demand. 

While bottlenecks in the supply chain squeezed supply, 

our local distribution offices worked as a global team, in 

managing the global order books, and sharing inventories 

to minimise any delays to customers.  Our ability to 

provide value-added services has enabled us to serve our 

customers more effectively.

Overall, 96,000 mT of latex, 193,000 mT of natural rubber 

and 20,000 mT of synthetic rubber was distributed mostly 

to EMEA countries (42%) and North America (30%). A 

majority of these materials was used in the automotive 

and consumer goods industries, while 35,000 mT (11%) 

were delivered for the manufacturing of gloves and other 

medical supplies.

CMC PLANTATIONS (CMCP)

CMC Plantations’ combined population of over 50,000 

people made 2021’s priority to safeguard our people 

from 

COVID-19 

infections. 

Large-scale 

awareness 

campaigns and vaccination drives were coordinated 

across our plantations, with encouraging results. The 

entire workforce in our Malaysian plantations have been 

fully vaccinated, while our Cameroonian plantations 

managed to achieve an employee vaccination rate three 

times that of the national rate. 

Despite the restrictive measures in response to COVID-19, 

CMC Plantations had a successful operational year. 

Export targets and imports of critical materials across the 

plantations were not affected despite the global freight 

disruption. 

In Cameroon, Sudcam’s total production was 2,401 mT for 

2021. This is an increase of 80% from 2020 due to tapping 

commencement in 1,175 hectares of newly matured 

areas, complemented with a higher-than-expected 

yield due to efficient tapping process. 2021 was the 

first full year of the new Sudcam centrifuge factory with 

first exports of 1,385 mT shipped to Europe and North 

America. The factory boasts advanced sustainability 

technologies including a zero effluent water treatment 

and solar panels that supplies green energy. The factory 

was also awarded the ISO 9001 quality management 

certification. 

Hevecam’s field production of 15,848 tonnes was an 

increase of 16% over 2020 due to an additional 650 

hectares newly matured areas being harvested, and 

an overall improvement in operational efficiency. The 

commercial decision to maximise latex production has 

resulted in higher revenue and profits due to latex market 

premiums. Total exports rose to 21,141 mT following 

higher production coupled with a 59% increase in third-

party purchases from smallholders and other plantations 

to maximise factory utilisation. Hevecam expects to 

apply for FSC certification over the next twelve months. 

The certification, which promotes environmentally 

appropriate, 

socially 

beneficial 

and 

economically 

viable management of the world’s forests will cover 

approximately 15,000 hectares of Hevecam’s planted 

land. At peak production, it is forecast that Hevecam will 

produce up to 27,000 mT of FSC certified rubber annually. 

In JFL, our Malaysian plantation, fresh fruit bunches 

production increased to 9,666 mT, up 16% from 2020. 

This was the result of more areas coming into maturity. 

JFL’s rubber trees are still immature although this is on 

schedule to start tapping in 2023. Our management team 

was proud to deliver the successful MSPO certification 

for all three JFL oil palm estates of Lebir, Ulu Nenggiri 

and Laloh. At the same time, the plantation was able to 

reduce its chemical usage by over 35% per hectare year 

on year. 

Communities engagement was prioritised across the 

plantations in 2021. JFL partnered with a local NGO to 

develop a stakeholder engagement plan that ensures 

inclusivity of its surrounding communities. Additionally, 

Hevecam and Sudcam in Cameroon continued their 

5-year Social Action Plans with the surrounding local and 

indigenous communities. This community engagement 

programme, led by local NGOs, includes access to 

water, medical care, educational support, protection 

of biodiversity, access to energy, as well as access to 

housing.

The successful pilot year of the Cameroon Outgrower 

Programme saw 160 smallholder farmers financed 

resulting in 200 hectares planted. Over the coming 

years, the programme will provide micro financing to 

13,000 smallholder families to reforest 27,000 hectares 

of current fallow or low yielding land with rubber and 

other cash crops. Agroforestry techniques will be applied 

to plant cash crops to provide immediate income until 

the core crop of rubber matures. The first fundraising 

tranche is expected to close in the next month, securing 

the first five years of planting.



Keeping our large workforce and supporting communities safe and healthy during 

the COVID-19 pandemic continued to be our main priority. Despite the challenges, 

the Corrie MacColl Plantations team worked hard in optimising our operations to 

successfully open new production area, begin commercial operations at our Sudcam 

latex factory, and advance our sustainability program. I am very pleased that we 

achieved these key milestones in such a challenging year.

a quarterly basis of macro-environmental developments and any impact arising with regard to the following key risks 

of the Group.

OUR APPROACH TO TAX

We are committed to ensure compliance with the law and relevant statutory compliance obligations.

We target to achieve optimal tax position for the Halcyon Agri Group – which does not always mean the lowest tax 

result possible in every transition, but rather an equitable one.

We respect and comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate which we knew or ought reasonably to have known.

We will not enter into artificial arrangements in order to artificially transfer profits from one business location to 

another in order to avoid taxation.

We support simple and competitive tax rules and stand by the principle that the taxing rights of countries should 

commensurate with where the economic activity occurs so as to support economic growth and job creation.

The Group Chief Financial Officer has overall responsibility for tax matters and is responsible for ongoing tax compliance 

and management of tax risks and exposures.

Governance and Sustainability

Halcyon Agri Corporate Report 2021 

Book 1: Strategy and Sustainability 30

Halcyon Agri firmly believes that upholding the highest 

standards of corporate governance practices is critical to 

ensure sustainable growth and success of the Group. We 

are committed to enforce best practices and all material 

principles of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018, as 

well as all other applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

Through progressive and proactive engagement with 

our stakeholders, including the regulators, governments, 

industry leaders and industry associations across 

jurisdictions where we have presence, we understand 

stakeholders’ perceptions and expectations, which are 

the key to create and maintain meaningful and mutually 

beneficial relationships.

The Company ranked among top 7% (34 out of 519 

companies) of companies listed on the Singapore 

Exchange 

in 

the 

Singapore 

Governance 

and 

Transparency Index 2021. It has been placed on the 

SGX Fast Track programme since 2019. This programme 

was launched by Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX 

RegCo) and aims to affirm listed companies that have 

been publicly recognised for high corporate governance 

standards and have maintained a good compliance 

track record. Companies under this programme will 

receive prioritised clearance on selected corporate action 

submissions to SGX RegCo.

Board Responsibility

The Board has overall responsibility for the company’s 

sustainability vision. Under the Board’s leadership, six 

key capitals: financial, manufacturing, intellectual, human, 

social and natural capital are allocated in the best 

interests of shareholders and key stakeholders. 

The Board identifies and considers all relevant 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors 

when reviewing the Group’s strategy, risk management, 

and business plans. It ensures that ESG factors (including 

climate-related issues) that are material to the Group’s 

long-term goal and viability are integrated into its overall 

business strategy. The Board reviewed the evaluation 

carried out by the Sustainability Department in 2021, 

and has identified Quality Excellence as one of the 

Group’s key ESG factors. Its decision is in line with the 

Group’s mission to be a leading sustainable supply 

chain manager that delivering high quality products and 

providing exceptional services, through the extensive 

quality management systems which have been 

implemented across the Group’s business operations. 

The Board establishes and maintains a sound risk 

management framework and adequate internal 

controls, setting risk appetite to achieve an appropriate 

balance between risk and the Group’s performance. 

When necessary, the Board would engage professional 

services to identify impacts, risks, and opportunities, 

as well as to conduct comprehensive studies on issues 

or concerns relating to the Group’s operations and 

business, including but not limited to climate-related 

risks and opportunities. The Board welcomes the 

recent amendments to the sustainability reporting 

for financial years commencing 2022 introduced by 

Singapore Exchange and believes that providing climate 

reporting on a ‘comply or explain’ basis improve the 

quality of sustainability disclosures. It will ensure the 

Group is prepared to combat the risk and consequences 

of climate change, and enhance its business climate 

resilience. 

Reporting and Assurance

Ultimately, the Board has overall responsibility for the 

Company’s ESG strategy, reporting and determining the 

approach management takes in addressing sustainability 

matters. As part of the initiatives and approaches to 

maintain and enhance trust with stakeholders, the 

Group has been subscribing to external review including 

EcoVadis1, certifying its business practices against 

international quality, health, safety and environment 

(“QHSE”) management systems, and implementing 

industry-tailored HeveaPro Industrial Standards. The 

Board will remain attentive to expectations for its 

sustainability disclosures, and will consider external 

assurance on its sustainability reports when appropriate. 

Composition and Competence

The Board adopts an inclusive decision-making approach 

to balance the needs and interests of the Company’s 

material stakeholders. It has a written Policy on Board 

Diversity which endorses and promotes the inclusion 

of different perspectives and ideas. Aligned with the 

regulator’s effort to working towards increasing the 

representation of female on boards, the Board has 

recently reviewed and updated its policy and set a target 

of 10% of female representation on Board by 2022. 

To ensure the directors of listed entities receive a 

baseline and common understanding of sustainability 

matters, 

Singapore 

Exchange 

has 

mandated 

sustainability training for all directors after the 

conclusion of its consultation launched in August 2021. 

The Company has since arranged for all its Board 

members to undergo training on sustainability matters, 

the Environmental, Social and Governance Essentials 

programme organised by the Singapore Institute of 

Directors in May 2022, which is the first training course 

following the new listing rule effective from 1 January 

2022.

Sustainability Management

With the support from the Board, the CEO supervises 

the management of material ESG issues and integrates 

them into the day-to-day management and operations 

of the Group. The CEO capitalises on the expertise of its 

management team and delegates sustainability related 

duties to the appropriate team members. For instance, 

the Managing Director – HRC Group leads and represents

the Group’s interests in industry-led sustainability 

discussions, including engagement with GPSNR. The 

CEO – Corrie MacColl Plantations, on the other hand, 

proactively maintains strategic relationships with key 

civil society groups and NGOs. Together, they champion 

the sustainability agenda of each business segment with 

the support from CEO and the Board, to achieve group-

wide sustainability targets. In 2021, they became senior 

sponsors to the participation of QHSE and Sustainability 

Departments in a global program by the UN Global 

Compact. The program were on setting Sustainable 

Development Goals (“SDG”) and Climate Ambitions, and 

serve as key step in assessing climate-related risks and 

opportunities for the Group. 

The Sustainability Department formed in 2019 comprises 

dedicated team members to support, unite and reconcile 

the sustainability agenda of the different business 

segments across the organisation. To strengthen 

the Group’s implementation of HeveaPro Social 

Responsibility standards, the department established 

a network of Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) 

Coordinators at each of the Group’s key operating areas. 

The CSR Coordinators are responsible for driving the 

Company’s social responsibility standards and practices 

in their operations and work alongside key functions 

such as (“QHSE”) and Human Resources (“HR”) teams, to 

ensure a holistic and harmonised sustainability approach 

across the Group.

Policies, Standards and Compliance

The Group has put in place a number of policies, 

standards, and systems for raising concerns as part of a 

strong ethics and compliance function. Our employees 

are required to adhere to, and comply with the Group’s 

policies and embrace high standards of ethical business 

conduct.

As one of the world’s largest supplier of natural rubber 

and the owner of sizeable plantations, Halcyon Agri 

understands its role and obligation in minimising impact 

to the environment while continuing to meet the growing 

demand for a critical natural resource. In August 2021, 

the Group successfully aligned its sustainability policies, 

especially the Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply 

Chain Policy (“SNRSCP”) with the of Global Platform of 

Sustainable Natural Rubber (“GPSNR”) Policy Framework. 

The Framework, a set of over 20 commitments approved 

by the GPSNR General Assembly in 2020, articulates 

expectations of every member for the sustainable 

development of the natural rubber industry.

On the other hand, our Sustainable Sourcing Policy 

articulates our requirements to suppliers. Established 

in 2019, the policy embraces our commitments to the 

SNRSCP. As we work very closely with raw material 

sources, we understand the complexities and challenges 

faced by our suppliers. Further details of this policy are 

elaborated in the succeeding sections relating to supply 

chain engagement.

Other key policies of the Group, including but not limited 

to anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy, human rights 

and ethical business practice, anti-harassment, as 

well as environment, health and safety are embedded 

into a Global Employees Policies handbook which 

is communicated to every employee through our 

mandatory induction programmes.

To supplement the implementation of the Group’s 

policies, open door policies and whistleblowing 

framework are also in place to provide employees and/

or third parties a trusted avenue to share their questions, 

concerns, suggestions or complaints and to ensure that 

their concern are addressed in the most appropriate 

manner.

Halcyon Agri’s Whistleblowing Policy provides the 

mechanism for reporting concerns involving unethical 

or unlawful behaviour relating to Halcyon Agri, its 

employees, vendors, customers and other relevant 

stakeholders. All concerns raised including those 

reported anonymously, will be handled in strict 

confidence, treated fairly and assessed independently. 

The mechanism also commits to protecting the 

whistleblower against reprisal and harassment. All 

reports are filed directly to the Audit Committee.

Ethics and Anti-Corruption

In 2021, we maintained a laudable record of zero 

confirmed incidents of corruption involving our 

employees. The Group continues to improve its ethics 

training practices and ensure all sites have proactive 

anti-corruption mechanisms in place. Supporting these 

efforts, HeveaPro Social Responsibility standards provide 

the Group with essential baselines and performance 

indicators to enable continuous improvement plans.

Guided by our Group’s policies and practices, we are 

heartened to report zero non-compliance to labour-

related laws and regulations for 2021. We are committed 

to maintain full compliance in the years ahead.

Understand and PREVENT

The HeveaPro Quality Standard is now owned by HeveaConnect. It was designed by Halcyon Agri based on a risk-

based approach. Prevention is emphasised to reduce the risk of non-conforming quality from occurring. After going 

through several revisions, measures which are prevention-oriented continue to form the majority checkpoints of the 

standards, currently representing 53% or 247 out of 465 checkpoints. Performance wise, year-on-year improvement 

is observed notwithstanding a 20% substantial increase in the number of checkpoints from 204 in 2018 to the 247 

checkpoints currently.

Monitor and measure to DETECT

More than 40% of the checkpoints are detection-oriented. Number of detection checkpoints has increased 

significantly from 142 in 2018 to 196 in 2021. The standard amplifies early detection mechanisms to prevent costly 

mistakes, especially those could have an impact on the downstream supply chain operations. As shown in the 2021 

audit results, the quality detection system is well implemented in our factories. The slight drop in 2020 overall score 

was attributed to the expansion of scope with 55 new checkpoints added to the detection system, and it was the 

adjustment period for the factories to become familiar with the new measures.

The HeveaPro Industrial &amp; Quality Standards being one of the core attributes of HeveaPro2 was designed with 

the objective of modernising the quality management system in the natural rubber processing industry through 

introduction of known international quality management principles and practices. The HeveaPro Quality Standard 

also has some performance expectations intentionally set at a high-level, to stimulate the target to move away from 

the conventional manual process for product quality controls, to the adoption of technology and advanced quality 

techniques.

To achieve this objective, the design of the HeveaPro Quality Standard with a comprehensive checklist, and has 

taken into consideration three key pillars of quality management, they are:

Learn and RECOVER

5% or 22 checkpoints under the standard are focused on recovery. In the event that both prevention and detection 

have failed and a quality issue occurs, either happen within our processes or affecting our customers, the HeveaPro 

system mandated a swift response from the factory to undertake comprehensive review and implement remedial 

actions to recover from the setback. The system also requires factory to record lessons learned from each incident 

and integrate them into a broader scope. To make more effective use of accident database and strengthen the 

overall system, lesson learned from incidents would be referred to when reviewing the prevention or detection 

procedures. Conformance to the requirement on Recovery has improved steadily from 94.18% in 2018 to 97.73% in 

2021.

Working Conditions

The Group is committed to fair working conditions by 

ensuring workplaces are free of discrimination, forced 

labour and child labour; upholding the right of workers 

to wages, and their right to freedom of association and 

collective bargaining.

Our employment practices prohibit any form of 

discrimination on the bases of age, colour, gender, race 

or religion. Discriminatory questions such as asking 

female applicants whether they are pregnant or intend 

to become pregnant are banned. Employees are granted 

maternity or paternity leave in accordance with local 

statutory requirements.

In the past three years, we witnessed a slight but steady 

increase in female representation across the Group. 

Female representation in senior management increased 

to 9.5% in 2021 compared to 8.4% in previous year.

It is our group policy to prohibit employment of underage 

workers (typically, below the age of 18). Through our 

management systems, we have mechanisms in place to 

check and verify the age of applicants in a confidential 

manner as part of our recruitment procedures.

As a standard practice, living quarters of our plantation 

and processing factory workers must comply with the 

local government labour codes and regulations. Electricity 

and waste collection bins are provided in these facilities 

and they are regularly maintained. Residential areas also 

have access to washing facilities and drinking water either 

through public water utilities or groundwater boreholes. 

For the latter, local EHS teams conduct groundwater 

quality tests to ensure safety of users and compliance 

to local water quality regulations. Consumption of water 

and electricity is monitored to ensure transparency to 

all users of housing facilities. Pest control monitoring 

activities are also done periodically to prevent the risk 

of vector-borne diseases infecting the workers and their 

families.

The Group adheres to the policy of equal employment 

opportunity and diversity. The Group ensures that its 

workers are remunerated not less than the minimum 

wage level imposed by respective regulatory authorities 

in the countries we operate in. 

We confirm a 1:1 ratio on staff entry level wages with 

legislated minimum wages. The ratio excludes benefits-

in-kind to employees for which when monetised, these 

can account for a modest percentage of their total 

compensation. Furthermore, the ratio applies both to 

male and female staff.

The Group is supportive of workers’ freedom of 

association and right to collective bargaining, as 

expressed under the Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply 

Chain Policy (“SNRSCP”). We have operations in China 

and Thailand where their respective governments to-

date have not ratified ILO 875 or 986. Despite this fact, 

we moved ahead of local laws and require our sites to 

encourage our workers to set up associations.

Collective agreements are widely practised across our 

plantations in Malaysia and Cameroon. For processing 

segment, HeveaPro Social Responsibility standards 

check for evidence on workers’ right to freedom of 

association and collective bargaining. To ensure this 

right is closely safeguarded, one of the important roles 

of CSR Coordinators is to help the factories to enhance 

existing procedures, and address any gaps identified 

from internal audits.

Workplace Health and Safety Management 

System

Our commitment to health and safety is embedded in 

our Sustainable Natural Rubber Supply Chain Policy 

(SNRSCP), and all our employees are covered by an 

occupational health and safety management system. 

The main system adopted by the Group is HeveaPro 

Industrial Standards on Environment, Health and 

Safety (HeveaPro EHS). With over 600 checkpoints, the 

HeveaPro EHS standard is specially designed for the 

rubber processing related activities.

In 2021, over 30 processing factories of the Group 

apply the HeveaPro EHS standard while several 

factories are ISO45001 certified. The Group applies its 

expertise of the Group across the value chain together 

with investment in technology, to produce the highest 

quality natural latex in a sustainable way. The in-house 

EHS management system for our plantation operations 

- LatexPro, is benchmarked against international 

standards and best practices. The LatexPro system 

guarantees the highest standard in quality assurance 

by applying these principles: Quality of Raw material, 

Quality of Process and Quality of management.

Hazards and Controls

All Halcyon Agri operating sites are required to conduct 

comprehensive Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment 

and Risk Control (HIRARC) activities in its operations. 

Adoption of these processes would be validated 

through annual internal and external HeveaPro audits. 

Findings are reported promptly to senior management 

for review to ensure continuous improvement in line 

with our SNRSCP commitments.

HeveaPro EHS standards aim to adopt best practices, 

going above and beyond basic regulatory requirement 

for periodic HIRARC records review. It requires the 

Group factories to review and update their HIRARC 

records on an annual basis. 

Incident reporting and investigation are mandatory in 

our operations. As a practice, workers are empowered 

to immediately discontinue their tasks at hand should 

they identify existing or potential unsafe activities. 

Workers who report such incidents are protected 

against reprisals as mandated by our group-wide 

whistleblowing mechanism. Other controls in place 

include physical controls and practices. Examples 

include installation and maintenance of emergency 

stop buttons on key machineries and, setting up of 

fire suppression equipment and safety and emergency 

signages throughout factory floor. Practices include 

regular inspection of personal protective equipment 

(PPE) to ensure they meet standards before issuing to 

workers, adoption of Permit-to-Work (PTW) system and 

Lock Out Tag Out procedures to control hazardous 

energy and protect workers from harm.

Health Services and Promotion

The health and wellbeing of all our workers, and of 

those who work on our sites, are paramount and is our 

top priority. We believe in preventive health and safety 

measures. Apart from annual staff health screening 

programme, we also conduct periodic evaluation on 

air quality, heat and noise at our sites, to ensure the 

working environment protecting workers’ health and 

promoting their wellbeing.

There are medical facilities within short distance of 

our sites for which timely health support would be 

available should there be workplace incidences. Access 

to health services is a requirement under the HeveaPro 

EHS standards. In 2021, amid the global pandemic, we 

tested a remote auditing program for HeveaPro audits 

for two of our factories in Indonesia during the wake 

of the pandemic. Annual audits continued to be carried 

out despite the challenges post by the pandemic, to 

ensure our product quality and operating standards 

remain intact and unaffected by COVID-19 disruptions.

Worker Engagement and Training

Despite most local regulations requiring only health 

and safety committees, our group policy mandated 

environment, health and safety (EHS) committees in all 

our operations. Meetings of the EHS committee, which 

represents all workers are held at least bi-annually and 

chaired by a competent employee. The EHS committee’s 

charters documented its procedures as well as the roles 

and responsibilities of members. Activities and decisions 

of the EHS committee are communicated to workers 

either physically, through notice board, and/or email 

circulars.

To complement this, EHS campaigns are held at least 

quarterly to reinforce and inculcate safe behaviours 

amongst our workers. Our campaigns in 2021 continued 

to be limited to virtual communications due to 

movement restrictions and safe management measures 

that are in place amid COVID-19 pandemic.

The scope of TÜV SÜD audit also includes verifying 

activities of EHS committee, its roles and responsibilities 

and ensuring workers are represented. HeveaPro 

EHS standards also require establishment of an 

environmental committee.

Training hours per worker in 2021 averaged at 2.61 

hours per worker with most hours spent in first aid 

training. We continue conducting training activities on 

various topics including emergency preparedness, fire 

prevention and EHS induction. The EHS briefings were 

especially relevant to step up safe distancing measures 

and screening activities for contractors and suppliers 

that visited our sites. We will continue to refine our 

training practices through needs assessment to ensure 

our workers remain vigilant about compliance with 

workplace health and safety measures.

Halcyon Agri actively manages the eco-efficiency and 

climate change aspects via its environmental management 

systems which are implemented throughout our 

operations. The monitoring of the system’s efficiency is 

enabled by applying the HeveaPro Environment, Health 

and Safety industrial standards and ISO14001. We are 

on track to obtain ISO14001 certification for the eight 

operating sites by end of 2025.

We continuously measure and monitor our performance 

in managing water resources, inputs and impacts, and 

strive to achieve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions. 

Resource Consumption

Water

Over 80% of our water consumption are related to 

our rubber processing activities. This is because a 

large volume of water are required to remove physical 

impurities from rubber to meet quality requirements. As 

most of our factories are located in urban or semi-urban 

areas, and with the looming threat of climate change to 

our communities, it is crucial for us to manage our water 

resources responsibly.

Our processing sites draw water primarily from surface 

water bodies and discharge them back to the same 

source. Surface water consumption is supplemented 

by drawing from local water utilities where available. 

Through our onsite teams, we actively track our water 

consumption in our processing sites as frequently as 

possible, and at least on a shift basis.

In our plantations, the main water sources include 

surface water and groundwater. These sources are used 

for field operations and domestic consumption. Water-

related impacts are identified through environmental 

impact assessments mandated by laws applicable to our 

operations. They are subsequently managed through 

local government- approved environmental management 

plans. In all countries where we operate, our processing 

operations with wastewater treatment facilities must 

meet the specific effluent quality standards imposed by 

the relevant regulatory authorities. We are also required 

to monitor groundwater quality, and surface water 

quality, and report these to the local authorities.

Building on Halcyon Agri’s partnership with Alliance 

for Water Stewardship at processing sites, we have 

initiated the sustainable water management certification 

for our Cameroon and Malaysia plantations in 2020. 

Hevecam has secured AWS Gold certification while JFL 

has successfully registered for AWS certification in 2021. 

These third-party certifications, which are beyond the 

regulatory requirement, demonstrates our commitment 

to consume natural resources responsibly, and help us 

in monitoring the sustainability criteria of the Deutsche 

Bank sustainability-linked loan secured by Corrie MacColl 

in 2020.

Water Withdrawal, Volumes and Sources

Using World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk 

Atlas (https://www.wri.org/aqueduct), we confirm that all 

our processing and plantations are located in areas with 

&lt;10% water stress.

Chemicals and Effluents

For plantations, we use mainly solid-state fertilisers, while fungicides, herbicides and pesticides are primarily in liquid 

form for application across our estates. A list of fertilisers and pesticides used at our plantations are presented in the 

table below. Their composition remains unchanged from previous year.

For processing operations, chemicals in solid and liquid forms (mainly Ammonia, formic acid and Deorub solutions) 

are used in crumb rubber and latex production. Ammonia is used for latex preservation while formic acid aids in latex 

coagulation. Deorub application helps to mitigate odour in processing sites.

Solid form of hydrated lime, hydroxylamine sulphate and caustic soda are the major chemicals use at our processing 

sites. Hydrated lime prevents rubber crumbs from sticking together. Hydroxylamine sulphate is added to TSR grades 

requiring constant viscosity while caustic soda is generally used in cleaning of equipment.

Effluent performance of our Cameroonian and Ivorian operations remain a priority in 2021. Local teams continued with 

desludging efforts, applied enhancements in drainage, anaerobic and aerobic processes, and stepped up operational 

controls. Moving forward, the Group will continue monitoring progress closely, conduct on site investigations and 

identify root causes. Through these enhanced efforts, the Group is optimistic of resolving this issue.





Energy Consumption

Natural rubber production is energy intensive. To maintain operational continuity, we consume multiple energy sources 

where it is locally accessible and reliable. 

Electricity consumption is measured through metered connections from the national grid. Site teams measure fuel 

consumption through duly-calibrated meters and weighing scales and reported to our Halcyon Data Centre. Our largest 

energy source is from purchased electricity, which comprises approximately 38% of the energy requirements across 

the years. 

The next significant contribution comes from natural gas used primarily for drying process at our factories. With 

access to biomass (palm kernel) in Indonesia, we steadily increased its application for our dry process infrastructure, 

supplementing fuel and gas consumption over time. In 2021, biomass consumption accounted for approximately 9% 

of our total energy needs, a figure held since 2018. Our liquid fuels, mainly diesel, are used for dryers and on-site 

generators either for back up purpose or as main electricity source at off-grid locations. Across our plantations, the 

primary energy source is liquid fuels (mainly diesel and petrol). 

Overall, we have maintained an energy intensity of between 1.7 and 1.8 GJ of energy consumed per mT of natural 

rubber produced in the last four years. As for plantations, we report an energy intensity of 3.38 GJ of energy consumed 

per hectare of cultivated area.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Climate change and global warming remain the key concern across our supply chain. We are committed in reducing our 

emissions over the long term. Our greenhouse gas emissions calculations applied the guidance from The Greenhouse 

Gas Protocol4. Fuel emission factors for each reported year were taken from the UK Government GHG Conversion 

factors for Company Reporting5 while grid emission factors were obtained primarily from the Institute for Global 

Environmental Strategies (IGES) List of Grid Emission Factors and Trucost. The largest contribution to total emissions 

comes from our Scope 2 emissions (purchased electricity) with an average of up to 70% across the years. Scope 1 

emissions (direct emissions) account for about 30% in 2021. In late 2021, we commissioned a project to conduct a 

complete greenhouse gas emissions inventory of the Group. The project will help us define our baseline year and 

prepare us for setting science-based targets in future. 

GHG emissions intensity trend improved steadily over the years. Our 2021 performance resulted in a 0.205 tCO2e 

per tonne of product from our processing factories. As for plantations, our performance resulted in 265 tCO2e per 

hectare of cultivated area in 2021. Our 2021 performance 0.074 tCO2e per USD ‘000 of annual revenue. We will continue 

exploring initiatives to help bring down our greenhouse gas emissions over time. Initiatives such as dryer retrofitting 

is one option as it not only provides efficiency gains but also operational flexibility due to its ability to combust natural 

gas or biomass alongside or as a replacement to liquid fuels.

Renewable Energy

Our factories consume a significant amount of electricity in the processing of natural rubber. In early 2021, our factory in 

Kedah, Malaysia saw an opportunity to shift a portion of its electricity needs to renewable energy sources, in particular, 

solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The project aims to reduce the factory’s carbon footprint and mitigate the increasing 

cost of grid-sourced electricity. With support from government schemes that support renewable energy adoption, the 

team commenced a detailed technical and finance study to look into the viability of solar PV project for the factory. The 

study has proved the feasibility of PV system and a competitive bidding process was commenced soon after. With a 

contractor chosen, the factory proceeded with the installation and commissioning of solar panels with a capacity of 232 

kW by year end. The use of solar power is expected to offset 219 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum, as well as help 

the factory save an estimated US$40,000 from electricity costs annually. 

The solar power project in Malaysia is currently the second factory in the Group to adopt solar power technology. The 

first was our new Sudcam factory in Cameroon. It started operations in early 2021 with 100kW solar panels installed to 

support their auxiliary lighting requirements. 

Through these initial successes, the Group hopes to widely adopt renewable energy technology in its other factories in 

the years ahead.

Stakeholder Engagement

Our key stakeholders are those who have a considerable influence on our business, and whom our business has a 

significant impact on socially and economically. Ethically and ecologically sustainable business practices are fundamental 

to the Company’s strategy for long-term growth. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is critical to determining, 

assessing and managing key risks and issues. As such, the Company has arrangements in place to identify and engage 

with the material stakeholder groups, including employees and those working across the supply chain.

We identified our key stakeholder groups based on the influence they have (or potentially have) on our organisation as 

well as the impact, whether positive or negative, our decisions and actions have on their own activities and decision-

making. This approach took into account the principles and guidance contained in the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement 

Standard 2015 released by AccountAbility6. The table below summarises our key stakeholder groups, our methods of 

engagement, and key topics raised from the stakeholder consultation on ESG factors carried out in 2020 and remain 

applicable in 2021.

Book 1: Strategy and Sustainability

Industry Engagement

Halcyon Agri recognises that partnerships and close 

cooperation amongst all supply chain stakeholders are 

crucial to creating a sustainable business and shaping 

the future of natural rubber industry. As stated in the 

sustainability policy, we are committed to maintaining 

inclusive and participatory dialogue with key 

stakeholders and supporting multi-stakeholder planning 

and development efforts. We focus on four key areas 

of stakeholder participation: engaging the industry, 

building relationships with smallholder farmers, 

partnering with our suppliers and promote traceable 

and transparent supply chain.

HeveaConnect

To inspire meaningful change in the natural rubber 

industry, Halcyon Agri founded HeveaConnect in 2018 

with the ambition to digitalise the traditional natural 

rubber supply chain and fulfil the growing demand for 

sustainably sourced and responsibly produced natural 

rubber from consumers. Through HeveaConnect digital 

marketplace, natural rubber producers and consumers 

are able to track pricing and supply information and 

transact directly the digital platform, promoting greater 

price transparency in the rubber industry. Since it was 

launched in April 2019, HeveaConnect has successfully 

matched over 450,000 mT of natural rubber for global 

tyre majors including some of our key customers, with 

gross sales value exceeding US$750 million.

HeveaConnect has received strong support from 

investors. The presence of Singapore Exchange (SGX), 

which invested in the Company in March 2021, along 

with early investors such as DBS Bank Ltd. and ITOCHU 

Corporation has effectively boosted HeveaConnect’s 

industry traction, facilitated onboarding of producers 

and customers alike, and accelerated its efforts 

to digitalise the industry and promote sustainable 

business practices along the supply chain. Cognisant 

that the industry participation is crucial for such a 

platform, Halcyon Agri has relinquished its controlling 

stake in HeveaConnect by transferring a portion 

of its shares into HeveaConnect Equity Trust. This 

also enables HeveaConnect to leverage on the data 

governance expertise of SGX from an exchange 

perspective. HeveaConnect takes an inclusive approach 

and hopes to collaborate with more producers so they 

can benefit from the trading platform’s data centre and 

data acquisition tools. In December 2021, HeveaConnect 

welcomed the premium tyre manufacturer, Continental 

onto its digital trading platform. Continental will handle 

a portion of its natural rubber purchasing through the 

platform to support transparency in the natural rubber 

supply chain.

Global Platform for Sustainable Natural 

Rubber (GPSNR)



Halcyon Agri supports GPSNR’s vision of a fair, equitable 

and environmentally sound natural rubber value 

chain. The multi-stakeholder initiative represents 

approximately half of global natural rubber volume 

and is represented by participants from every phase 

of natural rubber value chain, which comprises 

smallholder producers, producers, processors &amp; traders, 

civil society, tyre &amp; car makers and other product 

makers, as well as financial institutions. Halcyon Agri 

continued supporting GPSNR’s efforts in 2021 through 

representation in working groups and participation 

in consultation activities, namely GPSNR Reporting 

Requirements and Implementation Guidance.

In August 2021, the Group successfully aligned 

its sustainability policy with the GPSNR Policy 

Framework. At that time, only a handful of processors 

and producers have successfully aligned as the 

commitments are highly ambitious for the members. 

Through continuous dialogue with GPSNR Secretariat 

and civil society, we secured their acceptance and 

eventually, our revised Natural Rubber Supply Chain 

Policy (SNRSCP) was approved by Halcyon Agri’s Board.

(CCCMC)



In late 2021, the benchmarking exercise between CCCMC’s 

Sustainable Natural Rubber Guidance with HeveaPro 

Industrial Standards and international guidelines was 

completed. The Group intends to use the findings of 

such exercise to improve its implementation of HeveaPro 

standards.

Smallholder Farmers and Suppliers

The world uses 14 million mT of natural rubber every year. 

85%-90% of that global supply is produced by at least six 

million subsistence farmer households in developing 

economies. Halcyon Agri sources approximately 74% of 

natural rubber raw material from smallholder farmers, 

24% from third party distributors of finished goods while 

the remaining 2% is from company-owned plantations. We 

are acutely aware of the importance of the smallholders 

to the rubber industry, and are continuously engaging 

them to better understand their needs and concerns. Our 

sourcing activities cover multiple countries in Asia, West 

and Central Africa and South America.

Rubberway® in Palembang, Indonesia

Rubberway® is a technological solution that maps and 

assesses practices and risks regarding environmental 

issues, social affairs, and corporate social responsibility 

governance throughout the natural rubber industry, and 

along the natural rubber value chain10. 

In 2021, Halcyon Agri continued with its deployment of 

Rubberway® in Palembang, Indonesia. Through survey 

interviews with smallholder farmers, the initiative will 

help to better understand socio-environmental profile of 

upstream natural rubber supply chain in Palembang.

Our field teams interviewed over 2,000 smallholder 

farmers in 2021. As a matter of protocol, farmers are 

assured of protection of their data privacy and are 

briefed on the purpose of the survey. Prior to holding 

interviews, our field teams procured written permission 

of village heads and adhered strictly to safe distancing 

and hygiene practices throughout the exercise. To 

ensure the safety and security of our field teams, they are 

directly supervised and monitored by factory teams and 

CSR Coordinator-in-charge.

Cameroon Outgrower Programme

The programme aims to empower approximately 13,000 

smallholder farmers by offering livelihood support 

through an intercropping model and partnering on 

ecological conservation. The 15-year planting programme 

aims to produce sustainably farmed and traceable rubber 

from 27,000 hectares of degraded and low-yielding 

farmers. Updates and more information is available in the 

website: https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/sustainability/

Supplier Engagement

Corrie MacColl Group (CMC)

CMC communicated its Sustainable Sourcing Policy to 

its business partners to inform them of the company’s 

standards expectations. Continuing the collaboration 

with Rainforest Alliance an international NGO, CMC 

moved into the second phase with the release of an 

Implementation Manual and Strategic Actions Guide. 

Strategic actions will be implemented over a five-year 

period. Following distribution of the manual to CMC’s 

top 20 suppliers in early 2021, suppliers are expected to 

report on their progress from 2022. CMC hopes to work 

closely with its business partners to implement pragmatic 

and appropriate actions in driving the sustainable 

development of the industry. More information is 

available in the website:

Halcyon Rubber Company (HRC)

HRC’s key customers are tyre majors. The business 

segment sources mainly from independent smallholder 

farmers. Under the HeveaPro Industrial Standards 

regime, our processing factories are regularly audited 

on supplier engagement practices. Among the criteria 

reviewed are:

• adoption of an impartial and transparent supplier 

selection criteria;

• communication of our policies and code of conduct to 

suppliers; and

• verification of the identity of sellers, the volumes 

they sell and origin of raw material delivered to our 

factories.

In September 2021, HRC signed an MOU with Pact, Inc., 

prime contractor for USAID Green Invest Asia for the 

latter to extend technical assistance in reducing GHG 

emissions from its supply chain and increase investment 

in sustainable rubber in Southeast Asia. As first step, the 

collaboration will conduct a complete GHG emissions 

inventory of HRC’s supply chain especially Scope 3 

emissions from its suppliers and upstream activities. 

The project is expected to be finished by 2022 with 

aid of specialist consultants. This exercise will also be 

extended across key subsidiaries such as plantations 

and distribution to obtain a complete group-wide carbon 

footprint. Through this initiative, the Group hopes to pave 

the way for setting science-based targets and help reduce 

its impact on climate change.

As a responsible and accountable company, Halcyon Agri recognises the need to balance economic profitability and 

social equity, while protecting the environment and maintaining strict compliance to laws and regulations in areas 

where we operate. We approach this important responsibility in three key ways: Protect natural capital through good 

agricultural practices, policies and processes; Use our resources and influence to impact the community in positive 

ways; and create value and build relationships with the community through outreach activities. 

Protecting Ecosystems

The Group has responsibility over land area of close to 110,000 ha across Cameroon, Malaysia and Ivory Coast. 

Approximately 61% of our total land concessions are set aside for conservation. These include High Carbon Stock (HCS) 

and High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, a 25,000-hectare Community Forest established by Halcyon Agri within the 

Sudcam concession, and agroforest and primary forest land designated by the Ivorian government for conservation.

As a standard practice, our plantation teams conduct regular patrols of the concessions to prevent deforestation 

and illegal activities. To strengthen ground surveillance activities, Corrie MacColl engaged the services of MapHubs 

to conduct landscapes monitoring and verify our no deforestation status. Comparing maps in 2019 with 2021, the 

independent satellite imagery service confirmed that Corrie MacColl has upheld its commitment to no deforestation 

over this period. More information about monitoring our no deforestation commitment is available in the website: 

https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/monitoring-our-no-deforestation-commitment/.

Biodiversity Values

Hevecam and Sudcam concessions are located in the Southern region of Cameroon. Hevecam’s Niete concession 

is located on the edge of Campo Ma’an National Park, an area known for its rich biological diversity. From BirdLife 

International’s database8, a total of 200 species of birds have been recorded from the National Park, and more than 

another 100 from adjacent buffer zones. Non-aviary threatened species include mammals such as Loxondonta africana 

(EN), common in the south-west of the park, and primates including Mandrillus sphinx, Colobus satanas (VU) and Gorilla 

gorilla (EN).

Sudcam concession, through the Dja river, shares approximately 33 kilometers of natural boundary with the Dja 

biosphere reserve, a UNESCO world heritage site since 1987. The Dja reserve is habitat to a wide variety of primates 

which include the western lowland gorilla, red-capped mangabey, black and white colobus monkey and chimpanzee. 

Other mammals in the reserve include elephant, bongo, buffalo, leopard, warthog, giant forest hog and pangolin. 

Among the resident bird population are Bates’s weaver, found only in Southern Cameroon and reptile inhabitants 

including python, lizard and two species of crocodile-both of which are threatened.9

JFL’s land concession is located in Kelantan, a rural state in the north eastern part of Malaysia. The Lebir concession in 

particular is located in the Lebir Forest Reserve, a habitat known to be the home of endangered species such as the 

Malayan tiger.

Summary list of threatened species which can be or potentially be found in Halcyon Agri’s land concessions are as 

below. The list has been updated up to the date of this report’s publication.10

Conservation Practices

Halcyon Agri, through Corrie MacColl Plantations, maintains and adheres to its plantation management guidelines for all 

its land concessions. These plans integrate biodiversity management which cover the following activities: (i) Integrated 

pest management (IPM), (ii) Landscape monitoring, and (iii) Protection of waterways through buffer zones.

Integrated Pest Management

Our Malaysian concessions make use of cover crops such as Puerara javanica and Centosema pubescens whose flowers 

attract beneficial insects like wasps that help control insect pest population. The plantation also introduced the use 

of Mucuna bracteata, a leguminous plant widely used in oil palm plantations in Malaysia. The plant is mainly used to 

protect land from soil erosion which makes it an effective method to maintain overall soil quality and promote nitrogen 

fixation. The legume’s physical characteristics also prevent invasion of beetles after oil palm replanting.11

In Cameroon, some cover crops such as Mucuna bracteata and Pueraria Phaseoloides are considered invasive species. 

In response to UNESCO’s report entitled “Impacts des activites agro-industrielles de Sud Cameroun Hévéa sur le site du 

patrimoine mondial de la Reserve de Faune du Dja, Cameroun”, Sudcam has committed to the removal and eradication 

of these invasive plants to protect the ecological balance.

Despite disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic from 2020, we have successfully removed 80% of these cover 

crops at our 2012 and 2013 planting areas. The process is time and labour-intensive as we committed not to use any 

chemicals that may contaminate water bodies. While we have not yet identified any alternative cover crops apart from 

these invasive plants, we remain committed to exploring other alternatives.

Apart from these biological and mechanical controls, we strive to apply responsible pesticide application in plantations. 

In line with our commitment to minimise the use of fertilisers and pesticides and prohibit the use of chemicals and 

pesticides listed under the Stockholm Convention, Rotterdam Convention and World Health Organisation (WHO) Class 

1A &amp; 1B, we apply the following standard operational practices and approaches:

• spraying of pesticides with broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides as last resort,

• application of synthetic pesticides only as required and often only at specific life cycle patterns of a pest,

• progressively increasing use of pesticides from plant-derived or naturally occurring substances, and

• taking guidance from the Sustainable Agriculture Network’s (SAN) pesticide lists following the SAN 2017 Sustainable 

Agriculture Standard.

Fire Prevention and Suppression

In line with its commitment to zero deforestation and protection of forest areas, Halcyon Agri monitors fires and plays 

an active role in mitigating its occurrence in all our concessions. Cameroon and Malaysia, being tropical countries, 

experience both rainy and dry seasons. Climate data from World Bank show average monthly temperatures and rainfall 

from 1901 up to 2016.12 

In 2021, our plantations recorded 43 fire incidents, all from our Cameroonian concessions and mostly vegetation fires. 

Of the 43 incidents, 40 occurred in the first quarter of 2021 where temperatures tend to be at their hottest and rainfall 

at one of their lowest every year. 

Our plantations have dedicated teams on the ground to monitor fires on a daily basis. As standard practice, fire incidents 

are reported to plantation heads and local authorities within 24 hours. Weather is also closely monitored through the 

weather station at Hevecam. When incidents are reported, fire-fighting teams will be deployed immediately on site to 

suppress the fire. Incident investigations are also carried out by EHS teams to determine root cause and corrective 

actions to prevent recurrence. We regularly conduct training activities to maintain preparedness of our teams against 

fires. More information is available in our website: https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/fire-monitoring-and-management/

Watercourse Buffer Zones

It is our policy to have buffer zones in watercourses in our concessions. In accordance with local regulations and forest 

management standards, these buffer zones act as riparian corridors for essential wildlife movement and promote 

stability of river banks as they could mitigate soil erosion and provide stability to meandering features of watercourses.

The width of the buffer zones (for each side of the watercourse) depends on local regulation. In our Cameroon 

plantations, buffer zones have at least 30-meter width while in Malaysia it varies between 5 and 50 meters depending 

on watercourse size.

Respecting Human Rights

Grievance Mechanism

Our grievance resolution procedure addresses concerns from stakeholders in a systematic and transparent manner, 

and is published on the corporate website. https://www.halcyonagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HAC_Grievance-

Resolution-Procedure.pdf

The process flow provides specific timelines at each stage, targets to achieve and implement agreed monitoring activities 

within a six to twelve-month period. At the time of this publication, a total of 14 cases have been reported coming 

from our plantation business with six ongoing and eight closed. The last grievance case received was in February 

2020. Grievance cases are publicly reported at Corrie MacColl’s website: https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/sustainability/

sustainability-grievances/.

Complementing the established online grievance system, our Cameroonian plantation teams, in partnership with 

APED13 for Hevecam and APIFED14 for Sudcam, also implemented oral-based grievance reporting processes. This 

ensures our procedure remains inclusive by ensuring stakeholder feedback is received regardless of literacy levels. 

More information on collaboration with APED and APIFED is available in the website:

https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/progress-across-mighty-earth-sustainability-accord/

https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/apifed-partnership/

In Malaysia, JFL team conducted stakeholder consultations as part of Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification 

in 2020. JFL continues to maintain its stakeholder engagement activities as part of its certification. More information is 

available in the website: https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/jfl-receives-mspo-for-sustainable-palm-oil/.

For our processing activities, all our factories maintain open, transparent and independent grievance mechanisms 

in place with access to remedy. In 2021, our factories reported no significant complaints or grievances from local 

communities.

Process

One potential area of grievance is odour emissions from our processing sites. We are required to closely monitor and 

mitigate the impact through active odour treatment and preventive maintenance of air scrubbers. To address the 

grievance involving our factory in Hainan, China in 2020, the factory completed the upgrading of a wet line scrubber 

system in 2021 as planned. The upgraded system mitigates the cause of odour from its factory operations. 

Another notable initiative on odour mitigation was commissioned in 2021 by Teck Bee Hang’s Thungsong branch in 

Thailand. Using biofilter technology, the eco-friendly system significantly eliminates odour in and around the factory.

As a responsible corporate citizen, we remain committed to address and rectify issues promptly and maintain a 

harmonious relationship with local community.

Land provides a universal means of livelihood. To ensure Halcyon Agri’s activities do not compromise local food 

supplies, our plantations provide market access, income generation activities and good agricultural practices to local 

communities.

Since its establishment in 1975, Hevecam has been developing a food sourcing network. The plantation provides 

market areas for local vendors to sell food to the plantation population and also provides transportation for villagers 

to visit the local (Nlongo) market.

Sudcam operates and maintains bursar shops at workers’ camps to administer distribution of essential food items. 

They also partnered with state authorities to establish and support local residents’ food crops plantations. Sudcam 

has also initiated a program of income-generating activities to combat poaching in collaboration with Dja Reserve 

managers.

Furthermore, the Cameroon Outgrower Programme, which is an initiative of Corrie MacColl, provides integrated 

farming opportunities that not only support livelihoods of local communities but also provide food crops and livestock 

rearing opportunities during the gestation period of the rubber trees. More information on the program is available 

online: https://www.corrie-maccoll.com/sustainability/rubber-smallholders/

In Palembang, Indonesia, PT Hok Tong Keramasan initiated a self-reliance program with the community in 2021. Called 

Food Independent Village or “Kampung Mandiri Pangan”, the factory donates its organic sludge to serve as an excellent 

planting medium for the local community to grow crops. The produce is shared with community members.
