albERt phuay yong hEn  

Chairman and Group CEO

Sustainability is more than just caring for and protecting 

the environment. It applies to businesses as well, and is 

essential to their long-term growth.

With a better understanding and management of 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors, 

companies will stand in good stead to grow exponentially 

and sustainably for generations to come. 

At Excelpoint, we consider sustainability an integral part 

of our core business objectives, and we have put in place 

strategies to fine-tune our policies and processes, drive 

innovation, understand and mitigate potential business 

risks and challenges, identify and implement best 

practices and opportunities, and enhance resource and 

waste management.

In our Sustainability Report 2018, I am pleased to share 

that we have achieved good outcomes:

•	

innoVation

We made great strides towards new innovations 

such as Internet of Things (“IoT”) and far-field voice 

technology (“FFVT”) in 2018. 

We set up an IoT demonstration facility at our Singapore 

headquarters to feature our technical capabilities 

alongside our principals’ cutting-edge technologies 

in three promising IoT areas – smart buildings, smart 

agriculture and smart infrastructure, showcasing our 

ability to develop advanced and applicable solutions 

for our partners. These three areas have a strong 

focus on sustainability, helping to make life easier, 

smarter and more efficient for everyone. 

We also established a strategic investment arm housed 

under PlanetSpark Pte. Ltd. The investment arm 

focuses on investing in promising innovative hardware 

start-ups with good technology and unique market 

positioning in the IoT ecosystem which require help 

to adapt their products more practically with design 

improvements to scale up and cater to their target 

market segments. Through these investments, we 

could collaborate with these technologies to enhance 

our value-added services and product offerings.

In collaboration with our partners, we began 

spearheading an extensive far-field voice technology 

(“FFVT”) project through the establishment of a far-

field audio tuning laboratory (the first in Singapore) 

and the development of viable FFVT products with local 

and global partners. The lab will serve as a standards-

based facility for local and global companies to enable 

their products with FFVT interfaces, and for FFVT

our sustainability strategy is to create long-term value for our stakeholders and shareholders by managing the 

economic, environmental and social impacts, risks, and opportunities.

matERial Esg FactoRs

Our core approach to sustainability and business strategies is to identify, prioritise and manage the material aspects of 

our business that impact the environment, society and economy most. 

Our Sustainability Management Council (see page 11 for the Council chart) reviewed the material ESG factors of our 

business operations. The focus of our Council is our stakeholders, and while we assess our sustainability impacts, 

risks and opportunities, we also regard their expectations and concerns very importantly. Our Council also looked at 

sustainability trends in our sector and reporting practices of peer companies. We then identified and prioritised the 

most significant material topics, and included them in this report.

After the review, the material topics were approved by our Board.

promoting Quality culture

We strive to set and achieve highest quality standards 

to serve our principals and customers. Building and 

supporting a quality culture is at the core of our quality 

policy. We have established a formal quality system 

in compliance with ISO 9001 standards. The quality 

management system allows us to maintain and make 

continuous improvements in our processes.

In addition, we invest in ongoing training and education 

of our employees to ensure high quality of our products 

and services. 

investing in Research and development (“R&amp;d”)

We differentiate ourselves by providing our principals and 

customers with a wide range of innovative technological 

services to shorten the entry-to-market time at a more 

competitive cost. We leverage on new technologies from 

our principals, and also integrate the strengths of different 

principals to create new and innovative applications and 

solutions.

We continuously invest in building up our R&amp;D capabilities 

to drive innovation and to create cost-effective solutions 

for our customers. We have established R&amp;D centres in 

Singapore, China and Vietnam, which are supported by 

our dedicated team of professional engineers. One of 

our key R&amp;D goals is to add value to our principals and 

customers through creating reference designs. 

Equipped with extensive experience in the connectivity 

segment, our R&amp;D team focuses on innovating new 

technologies that solve our customers’ problems. By 

keeping abreast with market trends, our R&amp;D experts 

are able to develop required technology solutions, 

working closely with our principals. Over the years, we 

have excelled in communication technologies such as 

Bluetooth, BLE, Wi-Fi, near field communication, wireless 

charging and wireless audio, which prepares us for the 

next wave of technology – the world of Internet of Things 

(“IoT”).

Embracing this exciting wave of technology, we have 

built an IoT demonstration facility to feature our in-depth 

R&amp;D and technical capabilities that combine cutting-edge 

technologies from our strategic principals into advanced 

and useful applications. This facility is a platform for 

us to showcase our competitive strengths in sensors, 

wireless connectivity and gateway modules, which can be 

implemented in applications for smart buildings, smart 

agriculture and smart infrastructure. We are continuously

We respect the privacy of our employees, principals, and 

customers, and take necessary steps to protect their 

personal data. We have implemented a Personal Data 

Protection Policy with a stringent process in place to 

ensure that data is accessed only by authorised personnel. 

We comply with applicable laws relating to personal data 

protection in countries where we operate. In Singapore, 

we abide by the Personal Data Protection Act. Our 

Personal Data Protection Policy governs the collection, 

use, disclosure and care of personal data.

our approach is to attract, retain and develop the 

best talent to serve our principals and customers 

professionally.

People will always be the focus of Excelpoint, as they play 

a very important role in the business. Throughout 2018, 

we reviewed our human resource strategies and policies 

to retain and provide better welfare to our employees, 

which included the assessment of our employee incentive 

and performance schemes, welfare benefits and also 

our engagement activities. We prioritise feedback from 

our employees and strive to improve. We also continue 

to encourage the focus on skill sets and attitudes when 

nurturing employees over gender and age. These can be 

seen from the increase in our gender and age diversities 

year on year. Moving forward, we will continuously 

evaluate these strategies, in order to achieve a more 

holistic approach to staff retention and to improve our 

attrition rate.

Our goal is to be an employer of choice in our industry. 

We strive to provide an excellent learning platform, and 

offer career growth opportunities to our employees. Our 

human resource policies ensure an inclusive and vibrant 

workplace built on mutual trust and respect. We aim to 

hire the best talent to maintain high standards of our 

services. Through training and learning opportunities, 

we develop the expertise to stay at the forefront of 

technological advancements in our sector.

Employment

As of 2018, we had a total staff strength of 752, with 

223 new employees hired. Permanent employees 

represent 60.9% of our workforce, while the remaining 

are fixed-term contract and temporary staff. 62.2% of our 

employees are based in Hong Kong and China, followed 

by Singapore at 21.7%. About 97.0% of our employees are 

locals. On average, we have a relatively young workforce 

with male and female employees aged 37.5 years and 37 

years respectively.

supporting diversity

We are committed to nurturing a workplace that advocates 

fairness, justice, respect and inclusiveness regardless 

of race, religion or nationality, as our diverse workforce 

reflects the diversity of markets and customers we serve.

Women represent 38.4% of our employees. The proportion 

of female supervisors and managers is 31.9%, while 

women hold 22.2% of senior management positions. In 

2018, women accounted for 34.5% of new hires.

managing performance

We have implemented a comprehensive and transparent 

performance management system that covers all 

our employees, who participate in an annual formal 

performance appraisal exercise. The appraisal assessment 

includes assessment of an employee’s job performance, 

growth and development, and potential and unique skills 

and talents useful for the organisation. The performance 

management process includes self-appraisal by the 

employees followed by assessment and feedback by 

their supervisors. In addition to the annual performance 

appraisal, managers hold development discussions with 

their staff throughout the year.

advocating human Rights 

We support internationally accepted norms for protecting 

human rights. Our policies ban child labour, forced or 

compulsory labour, and discrimination. We respect our 

employees’ right to freedom of association and collective 

bargaining. 

There were no reported incidents of child labour, forced 

or compulsory labour and discrimination in the reporting 

year. 

providing training 

We operate in a sector that is known for rapid technological 

advancements and continuous emergence of new 

technologies. Regular upgrading of skills is a crucial area 

for our business success. Therefore, we invest in ongoing 

training and education of our employees. In addition to 

formal training programmes, our employees receive in-

house or on-the-job trainings.

In 2018, we provided a total of 1,036 hours of training to 

our employees.

Providing	Employee	Benefits	

Our full-time employees receive competitive benefits 

in line with market practices. These include paid annual 

leave, insurance coverage, an employee share option 

scheme for our long-serving staff, medical, dental and 

specialist outpatient benefits, staggered work schedules 

for our support team, and recreational facilities. 

Engaging Employees 

Excelpoint believes that happy, engaged employees work 

harder, smarter, and better, which will maximise business 

productivity and efficiency.

practising occupational health and safety 

Our employees’ safety and health at the workplace is one 

of our top priorities, and our ultimate goal is to have a 

zero accident workplace. We are committed to managing 

and reducing safety and health risks through effective risk 

management.

In Singapore, we have obtained BizSafe Level 3 certification 

awarded by the Workplace Safety and Health Council, 

based on an audit conducted by an approved third-party 

assessor. 

We conduct a risk assessment to identify potential 

workplace safety and health risks to take preventive 

measures. We have implemented safety measures in our 

warehouse operations where tasks involve handling of 

bulky items, and established a safety committee consisting 

of representatives from all departments and our senior 

management. The committee reviews safety standards, 

systems and performances periodically. 

There were no incidents of severe or fatal workplace 

injuries in 2018.

enVironment

We are committed to minimising the environmental impact of our business operations through efficient use and 

conservation of our resources.

We always ensure that we use our electricity and energy efficiently and more effectively. We believe that every company 

can play a role in the ecosystem to save the environment. We continue to track our usage to ensure that it is within a 

reasonable range, as well as work with relevant parties to come up with initiatives throughout the year so that we can 

encourage our employees to recycle, use water wisely and be more energy efficient.

As a company engaged mainly in electronics distribution, our direct environmental impact consists of the use of 

electricity in our offices and warehouses, the use of fuel in transportation for deliveries, packaging materials, and 

general waste generated from the re-packaging of goods in our warehouses. Even though our direct environmental 

footprint is relatively small, we believe we can contribute to global goals of climate change mitigation and resource 

conservation. 

Our environmental policy is to reduce the impacts of our business activities on the environment. Our environmental 

efforts focus on finding ways to reduce energy consumption and waste. We monitor our energy use, resulting carbon 

emissions and the waste generated to review our performance regularly.

We are also supportive of industry-wide initiatives undertaken by electronics manufacturers (many of them are our 

principals or customers) to mitigate the environmental impacts.

Our R&amp;D applications include working with our principals to develop technologies that are more energy-efficient, such 

as smart lighting and smart energy.

Energy 

Our approach to energy management involves monitoring and reducing consumption. We have employee awareness 

initiatives to encourage them to turn off lights and air-conditioning in offices when they are not in use.

Our energy data in the report includes purchased electricity, diesel, and fuel. In 2018, our electricity consumption and 

electricity used per employee were 964,375 kWh and 1,282 kWh respectively. Our offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and 

China accounted for 92.7% of the total electricity used.

Our energy intensity per employee was 5.7 GJ in 2018, as compared to 5.4 GJ in the previous year.

carbon Emissions 

Reducing carbon emissions is crucial for achieving reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement to limit rising global 

temperatures to under 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 

Our carbon emissions originate from electricity consumption within our facilities and the combustion of fuels in our 

vehicles. We measure, monitor, and report our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using the GHG Protocol guidelines. We 

report our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions, and exclude fugitive emissions from refrigerant gases that 

are not material.

In 2018, our CO2 emissions from the use of electricity, diesel and petrol amounted to 619 tCO2. In 2018, our CO2 

emission intensity per employee was 0.82 tCO2, as compared to 0.81 tCO2 in the preceding year.

general waste

As a trading operation, our waste is limited to mainly packaging materials, which 

include cartons, plastic, strings, plastic wraps, wooden pallets, and paper. Our policy is 

to minimise and reuse waste where possible. We dispose our waste through licensed 

contractors.

compliance

We are committed to ensuring compliance with applicable environmental laws. There 

were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental rules or regulations in the 

reporting year.

We put aside an amount every year as part of our efforts to help the community. The three core pillars of our corporate 

social responsibility activities are Supporting Education, Forging Collaborative Partnerships, and Providing Opportunities 

for Employee Volunteering. We continue to extend our support in these three areas, as we strongly believe in “We 

Share, We Care”.

Our community initiatives focus on helping children and youths, and building the next generation of leaders.

Some of our community programmes over the past three years are listed here:

our approach is to build trusted relationships with local communities through contributions and employee 

volunteering.

• Supporting Singapore Management University since 

2014, our Excelpoint Bursary has continued into its fifth 

and final year, disbursing S$260,000 over five years for 

disadvantaged students to pursue their studies without 

financial worries.

• Since 2017, we have been funding National University 

of Singapore (“NUS”)’s Innovation &amp; Design Programme 

(“iDP”) (formely known as Innovation &amp; Design Centric 

Programme) to support students’ engineering and 

technological projects through a sponsorship of 

S$300,000 (to be disbursed over five years).

• In collaboration with Singapore Management University 

since 2014, our Excelpoint Bursary has continued into 

its fourth year, disbursing a total of S$52,000 annually 

for five years for underprivileged students who could 

thus pursue their education and passion without having 

to worry about their financial issues.

• As we strongly believe that the spirit of innovation 

and enterprise starts from young, we were pleased to 

extend our inaugural support to two reputable tertiary 

institutions: 

 – NUS’s Innovation &amp; Design Centric Programme (“iDCP”), 

where we began funding students’ projects through 

a sponsorship of S$300,000 (to be disbursed over 

five years). With this sponsorship, students would 

be able to engineer and market new ideas, products 

and technologies that could improve lives, enhance 

productivity, and create opportunities and a better 

future for Singapore.

Students from NUS’s iDCP presenting their creation, EcoCar, at the 

Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2018 in Singapore. The EcoCar project is one 

of many student projects funded by our company through iDCP.



 – Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s 

iSTEAM Robotics Programme 2017 with a sponsorship 

of S$16,800 (HK$100,000). Students would be able to 

develop experiential learning for various disciplines, 

such as science, technology, engineering, and design, 

through robotics. 

• We sponsored S$10,000 to Halogen Foundation’s 

Charity Golf Challenge 2017 event in Singapore, in 

support of the latter’s efforts to help youths in need. 

Like Halogen Foundation, we also believe in investing 

in and empowering the future of our nation. Hence, we 

participated in one of the foundation’s core programmes, 

Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, to educate 

underprivileged children aged between 15 and 19 about 

leadership and entrepreneurship. In addition, as part of 

our staff engagement initiatives, we organised a movie 

night for all our staff, and extended a sponsorship of 

S$10,000 to Halogen Foundation to arrange for a similar 

event for its staff.

• We donated S$5,000 to the UOB Heartbeat Run/Walk 

event, which is one of UOB Singapore’s key annual 

charity programmes to help raise funds for the needy.
