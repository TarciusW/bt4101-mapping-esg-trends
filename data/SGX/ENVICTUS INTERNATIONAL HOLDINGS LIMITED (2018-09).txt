Our first sustainability report has been prepared in accordance with the SGX-ST Mainboard 

Listing Rule 711(B), and in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, Core 

option, for the financial year ended 30 September 2018, which highlights the Group’s 

commitment to undertaking business in a responsible and sustainable manner. We have 

chosen to report using the GRI Standards, because it is an internationally recognised reporting 

framework that covers a comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. Moreover, the 

structured framework promotes reporting a full and balanced picture of the Group’s material 

matters and the management of its impact. This report represent the industry practice for 

tracking performance on a range of economic, environmental, social and governance

and Dairies Division in Malaysia.  

 

The statement offers an overview of the sustainability approach and initiatives made by the 

Group on how it creates economic value, protects the environment and pursues social 

development in the food and beverage sector.

to selected economic, environment, social and governance indicators that contribute to the 

sustainable development of the Group and are of interest to its internal and external 

stakeholders. The information and data disclosed in this statement were derived from internal 

reporting processes, systems and records. While the report has not undergone full external

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

 

The Group is committed to create long-term value for the stakeholders. The sustainability 

strategy is to assess and manage the most material economic, environmental, social and 

governance impacts, risk and opportunities arising from the business operations with an aim 

to support sustainable growth of the business. 

 

Materiality assessment is essential to the sustainability strategy. We performed a peer 

benchmarking assessment of sustainability-related disclosures to generate a list of potential 

material matters. Subsequently, each business and department head, deliberated and 

prioritised on the most material sustainability matters.  

 

The sustainability focus areas identified as integral to our business are outlined in the table on

ENVIRONMENT 

(i) 

ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION 

 

Energy conservation plays an important role to the environment, the ways of utilisation 

of non-renewable resources would also impact the environment. Conservation of 

electrical energy can help to lessen pollution hence the Group has taken necessary 

steps to reduce it.  

 

Pok Brothers 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for Financial Year (“FY”) 2018 

To replace current lights to LED 

lights completely by 2021 

First phase completed - Cold room lights have 

been replaced with LED lights. 

Communication and education on 

energy saving  

Sharing on energy saving during meetings  

 

Our Electricity Conservation Management Initiative: 

 

- 

Communication and education: Provides clear definition of energy efficiency to 

educate employees on their energy behaviours and start internal initiatives to 

encourage lower energy consumption. 

 

- 

Lighting: Encouraging employees to switch off lights when it is not in use, to maximise 

daylight and reduce unnecessary lighting.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1) 

Manager’s room lights and other 

application turn off during their 

absent. 

 

2) 

A position of office lights has been 

turn off during the day light. 

 

- 

Electrical inverters: Management has invested in installing electrical inverters instead 

of auto transformer starters in the new warehouse base on West Port. The electrical 

inverters would be able to reduce electrical consumption by 30%.  

 

By reducing the amount of energy consumed in facilities can cut the power costs 

significantly. The costs saving from these efficiency projects can then be used for 

other purposes. 

 

- 

Equipment: Utilise smart plugs or power management functions on electronic 

equipment, such as computers, monitors and printers.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

Waste prevention is the best way to manage waste. The Group strives to embrace 

environmental sustainability by managing environmental conservation through adopting 

“Reduce”, “Reuse” and “Recycle” (“3R”) practices. 

 

Pok Brothers 

 

In an effort to become more sustainable, we are taking appropriate measures to make 

our warehouse more eco-friendly.   

 

REDUCE the use of single-use Plastic Bags. 

 

We will replace current carrier bags used in our retail market with 

biodegradable carrier bags once our current stock depletes. 

 

 

 

REUSE packaging materials and plastic pallets in our warehouse.  

By reusing, we can reduce solid waste disposal and cost of purchasing 

packing materials.  

 

 

 

RECYCLE wooden pallets, broken pallets and other packaging materials 

to minimize solid waste. 

 

 

 

 

For continuous effort to reduce waste disposal, we will provide training and guidelines 

for all employees to better understand the principles of 3R and put it in practice. Recycle 

bins will be placed at accessible area within the facility. A 3R team will be appointed to 

ensure proper execution of 3R in our warehouse and workplace. 

 

We have recorded approximately 12 tons of solid waste disposed from our warehouse 

operations annually. Through this program, we target to recycle 25% of waste to 

compensate the negative environmental impacts resulting from the landfilling of solid 

waste. With reduction in waste, we expect a reduction in garbage disposal expenses.  

 

The success of 3R program could be used to convince stakeholders involved in waste 

management about the overall benefits of recycling and its influences on social and 

environment sustainability for promoting and strengthening recycling activities within the 

organisation. 

 

During the financial year, there are 5,724 units of wooden pallets being recycled. In 

addition, there are a total of RM18,421 was collected from recycling wooden pallets 

received from incoming shipments.

0.4% of finished goods output being recycle in 

FY2018 

 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives 

 

- 

Food waste recycle: the food waste is recycle into animal feed instead of sending 

directly to the landfill. The objective is to reduce the overall waste generation per ton 

such that it does not exceed 2% of the metric tons produced. 

 

- 

Carton waste recycle: originated from finished goods packaging from various 

sources, eg: damage carton from the line or from warehouse. We will continue to 

minimise the carton waste by putting our efforts on operational control and quality 

of carton. 0.4% of finished goods output were recycled in FY2018. 

 

- 

Plastic waste recycle: originated from production line processes. There is 0.7% 

finished goods output being recycle in financial year 2018 resulted a satisfactory 

development. We are expected to maintain the current result for FY2019.

- 

Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) - certified paper packaging: Our boxes and 

paper cups are made from FSC. This means that the paper has been sources in an 

environmentally-friendly, socially responsible and economically viable manner. 

FSC-certified products go through a “chain of custody” from the forest to the 

manufacturer to the merchant and finally to the printer. During the financial year, we 

have purchased 22.3 million pieces of FSC - certified packaging for our restaurants 

nationwide. 

 

It also requires a “management plan” that outlines the scale and intensity of logging 

and renewal operations, in addition to long-term objectives for maintaining the health 

of the forest.

producer complies with good agricultural, social and environmental practice, as 

dictated by the RSPO. During the financial year, our restaurants nationwide used 

583,000 kg of RSPO certified palm oil. 

 

- 

Biodegradable plastic bags: We give out biodegradable plastic bags instead of 

regular plastic bags at our restaurants in the Federal Territories. Biodegradable 

plastics are proven to be more environmentally-friendly, as they are able to 

breakdown more quickly when exposed to the elements. During the financial year, 

we have given out 752,000 pieces of biodegradable plastic bags at our restaurants 

in Federal Territories. The management aims to extend the usage of biodegradable 

plastic bags to our stores in other states in year 2022.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – SUPPORTING LOCAL ARTS 

 

San Francisco Coffee 

 

The group believes that independent artists and photographers produce quality artworks 

and photos. Unfortunately, these artists/photographers do not receive the deserved 

recognition for their work. San Francisco Coffee reaffirms their commitment in supporting 

the local art scene by providing avenues for these artists/photographers to showcase 

their artwork. These ranges from murals to doodles to installation and everything in 

between. Preference is given to an artist that is local to the outlet with a budget of up to 

RM10,000 per outlet. 

 

 

 

San Francisco Coffee strives to align our brand with creativity and innovation. 

Collaboration with these promising artist provides an excellent avenue for San Francisco 

Coffee to unify with the community.
