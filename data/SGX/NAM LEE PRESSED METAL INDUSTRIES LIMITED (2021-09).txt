BOARD STATEMENT  

 

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) of Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries Limited’s (“Nam Lee”, the 

“Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to present the fourth sustainability 

report for the Group’s financial year ended 30 September 2021 (“FY2021”). The Board is responsible for the 

overall direction of the Group’s operations and business development while monitoring and reviewing 

corporate governance practices across all operations.  

 

The Board believes in the importance of sustainability reporting and is responsible for considering 

sustainability of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors as part of its strategic consideration.  

 

Notwithstanding the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group remains focused on achieving its 

long-term sustainability goals by adopting a phased approach. We aim to progressively enhance our 

sustainability performance while growing our business in the long-term. 

 

The Report seeks to present accurately the practices and performances in our quest to be a sustainable and 

responsible corporate citizen. The ESG matters in this Report have been reviewed by the Board.

OUR APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

Engaging with stakeholders who are connected with the Group deepens our understanding of the evolving 

expectations and views about the Company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. 

 

We engage regularly with a range of stakeholders on topics of interest to them through multi-channels as 

summarized in the chart below. In addition to ongoing dialogue with stakeholders as part of our day-to-day 

operations, we also evaluate on an annual basis the pertinence of our identification of ESG factors taking 

into consideration how external and internal situations evolve.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS  

 

Nam Lee reviewed the relevance of the various ESG topics first identified in FY2018 based on discussions 

with our internal and external stakeholders. We refined our materiality matrix with input from senior 

management, and grouped these topics into three key Sustainability Focus Areas: 

 

1. Governance and Compliance 

2. Environmental Stewardship  

3. Employee Management 

 

We expanded the use of relevant GRI standards to report on the practices and performance of material 

topics.

SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS  

 

Governance and Compliance  

 

To ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the high standards that Nam Lee sets for 

itself, Nam Lee adopted internal rules to govern the Company and processes for monitoring compliance 

with external and internal rules by all business units and functions in the Company.  

 

Dealing in securities 

The Company’s code of conduct regarding dealings in the securities of the Company by Directors and 

officers in the Group is based on Listing Rule 1207(19). 

 

The Company issues reminders to all Directors and officers informing them that they are not permitted to 

deal in the Company’s shares during the period commencing one month before the announcement of the 

Company’s half-year financial statements and full-year financial statements, or if they are in possession of 

unpublished price-sensitive information of the Company. 

 

The Directors and employees are discouraged from dealing in the Company’s securities based on short-

term considerations. 

 

Directors are required to report to the Company Secretaries whenever they deal in the Company’s shares. 

The Company Secretaries update the Register of Directors’ Shareholdings and make timely announcements 

on SGXNET. 

 

Anti-Corruption (GRI 205-3) 

 

At Nam Lee, we maintain ethical and governance standards and will not tolerate corrupt practices of any 

kind in our business operations. Our commitment to prevent corruption is clearly set out in our Company’s 

anti-corruption policies and the Code of Conduct which state that no staff should accept advantages, gifts 

or entertainment from our business partners, including suppliers and contractors. Our anti-corruption 

measures are   supported by a robust corporate governance framework.  Stakeholders can and are 

encouraged to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible improprieties in financial or other matters. Our 


 

12 

 

whistleblowing policy with illustrative scope and communication process is published in the corporate 

webpage for transparent communication to all stakeholders. We harnessed technology to increase 

efficiency and security of reporting. Any report sent to the designated whistleblowing email address 

published in the corporate webpage will be automatically fed to the emails of independent directors without 

any human intervention. Procedures have been established for the independent investigation of any such 

reports so that appropriate follow-up actions can be taken. For more information relating to our corporate 

governance structure and practices, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report section of our Annual 

Report 2021. 

 

The independent directors have not received any complaint or report pertaining to financial or other 

substantive matters during FY2021. 

 

Socioeconomic Compliance (GRI 419-1) 

 

Compliance with regulatory requirements remains one of our top priorities. We ensure our business is 

conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all jurisdictions that we operate in. Nam Lee keeps abreast 

of changing regulatory standards and requirements and maintains vigilance in managing regulatory 

requirements associated with operating in different business environments. This is especially pertinent with 

the evolving nature of regulatory provisions for governmental efforts to contain the COVID 19 pandemic. 

 

We have not received any significant fines or sanctions in FY2021 due to non-compliance with regulations or 

standards.  

 

 

 


 

13 

 

 

Environmental Stewardship  

 

Environmental and safety controls needed to protect personnel and the environment are identified and 

implemented. We recognise the impact our business activities may have on the environment and are 

committed to minimising this impact through reduction in energy consumption and carbon footprint as well 

as managing our waste responsibly. Our chemical management program ensures that all chemicals used 

on-site comply with applicable chemical regulations. We procure chemicals from suppliers who we believe 

share our views on using a range of ethical products, compliant with regulations.  Within our offices, we 

have in place various initiatives to conserve resources such as energy and water, and we use FSC1-certified 

paper for our daily operations.  

 

Environmental Compliance (GRI 307-1) 

 

Nam Lee regularly conducts environmental, health, and safety (EHS) program self-assessments and internal 

audits to validate our site-level EHS compliance. The audits include in-depth documentation of reviews, 

interviews with site management and physical inspections related to EHS compliance. Nam Lee’s 

manufacturing sites in Malaysia are certified to ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System for 

fabrication and coating of metal products.  

 

There have been no reports of environmental non-compliances in FY2021 and we are committed to 

maintaining high standards of environmental compliance. 

 

Waste Management (GRI 306-2) 

 

Waste management is an essential part of our day-to-day operations. We practice the waste hierarchy of 3R 

(reduce, re-use and recycle) to extract the maximum practical benefits from materials and to generate the 

minimum amount of waste. Nam Lee promotes processes that optimise resource usage and eventual move 

towards near zero waste processes. Our production facilities segregate the recyclable waste from general 

waste by placing clearly labelled recycling bins at designated areas to facilitate recycling efforts.  Our waste 

water treatment equipment within the plants treat waste water generated from our production activities. 

Prior to discharge, the treated waste water is tested to ensure compliance with local discharge standards. 

 

1FSC® - A forest certification granted by FSC (the Forest Stewardship Council) for materials or products including paper and pulp, and 

corrugated cartons that use properly managed forest resources. 


 

14 

 

 

No hazardous waste was disposed of in FY2021. Examples of waste that we send for recycling are scrap 

metals from the production processes. The following table shows the quantities of non-hazardous waste 

which we recycled during FY2021. We recycled a total of 2.8 tonnes of non-hazardous waste in FY2021 

compared to 1.8 tonnes in FY2020. This increase was due to an increase in customer orders and clearance 

of old stocks during the relocation of our office in Singapore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

15 

 

Energy &amp; Emissions Management (GRI 302-1, 305-1) 

 

To reduce energy consumption, our offices are installed with electrical appliances which are rated as 

energy-efficient, such as LED light bulbs. The layouts of our production warehouses are structured to 

optimise lighting. All employees are reminded frequently to switch off machines and lighting when not in 

use. 

 

In FY2021, total energy consumption by our Singapore and Malaysia operations was 48,582,300MJ and our 

overall emission was approximately 8,684 tCO2. The increase of approximately 35% in total energy 

consumption and 35% in GHG emissions compared to FY2020 was due to higher level of production to 

cater for increased customer orders. As a gauge of increased activities in FY2021, the Group’s revenue 

increased by 68% over FY2020. We will continue to track and monitor consumption of energy in and 

emissions from our various sites so that we can identify areas for improvement, test, understand better and 

implement activities that result in greater efficiency.

Emission factors for energy consumption are based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 

Energy; grid emission factors for Singapore are sourced from Market Authority (EMA) Electricity Grid Emission Factor 

(2020) and grid emission factor for Malaysia is sourced from Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (2021). List of

Our Employees and Partners 

 

Employee Management  

 

Employees are our most valuable asset. As our business is labor-intensive, the health, safety and skills of our 

employees are of predominant importance to us. We aim to provide a comfortable and friendly working 

environment for all, enabling employees to approach challenges with a sense of purpose, innovativeness in 

approach, pride in work and achievement, and be appropriately evaluated for their performance.  

 

We are committed to providing an inclusive, safe working environment with equal opportunities for 

continual development. We embrace diversity in gender, age, race, nationality, values and background and 

focus on the skills, energy and creativity of a diverse group. Any form of discrimination based on 

distinguishing characteristics is not tolerated. 

 

Employee Welfare (GRI 401-1, 401-2, 405-1)  

 

Our employees are entitled to health care benefits under the Group’s hospitalization insurance plan, 

including medical care and dental care. Personal Accident Insurance Policy and Workmen Compensation 

Policies with disability coverage are also provided. Our employees are entitled to various paid leave such as 

annual, parental, compassionate, marriage and examination leave. Statutory contributions to employees’ 

pension funds are made on a timely basis. In addition to regular reviews of our employment policies and 

remuneration practices to ensure compliance with updated employment laws, we also adopt industry best 

practices to provide optimal working conditions for our employees. 

 

At the end of FY2021, Nam Lee employed a total of 1,563 employees in Singapore and Malaysia. Due to the 

nature of our work, about 91% of our employees are male. The percentage of employees hired (hiring rate) 

in FY2021 was approximately 28.3% while the percentage of workers who left (turnover rate) during the 

same period was 11.9%. Compared to FY2020, our hiring rate has increased by 4.8% while our turnover rate 

has decreased by approximately 7.1%.

Employee Development (GRI 404-1) 

 

Nam Lee recognises that continual development of employee skills and knowledge is critical to maintaining 

a competitive, relevant and motivated workforce. Career development and performance management are 

established to align with corporate objectives. We continue to review and improve our career development 

and performance review process in a constantly evolving business environment. A variety of relevant 

training opportunities specific to job requirements is arranged for all employees. Our training programs 

cater for employees with different job scopes and skills-set requirements. Our core training curriculum and 

content are developed and guided by well-established industry and international standards. 

 

In FY2021, in addition to on-the-job training by more experienced staff, employees received an average of 

about 1.67 hours of training. As part of the company’s implementation of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, our 

executives and other staff attended training related to these management systems standards. A focus on 

technical training was provided for our general employees, covering topics such as waterproofing 

techniques, as well as health and safety related training. Finance personnel are trained on budgeting and 

accounting updates. Executive directors attend courses on board and board committee functions and the 

related regulations. 

 

In light of the changing working environment, we continue to revise our training curriculum and program to 

align them with our objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach. We aim 

to increase the training hours per employee in FY2022.

Workplace Health &amp; Safety (GRI 403-1 to 403-7) 

 

The safety and well-being of our employees are of paramount importance at Nam Lee. As a result of 

commitment to workplace safety, Nam Lee successfully attained the bizSAFE Star award and ISO 45001 

certification in Occupational Health and Safety Management in FY2021. 

 

We instill stringent workplace safety measures and continuously monitor our performance to identify any 

gaps that need improvement. A strong culture of workplace safety and well-being promotes higher 

productivity in the daily work activities of employees. Workplace safety awareness and training are provided 

to all employees to ensure adherence to adequate safety practices. Employees who engage in higher risk 

work activities or who operate complex machineries are provided with additional training specific to their 

tasks. Daily meetings are conducted with employees and subcontractors to ensure everyone is aware of 

activities scheduled for that day and to highlight specific health and safety concerns. Workplace health and 

safety issues are highlighted in the monthly committee meetings with representation from the workers.  

 

Every worker is expected to report incidents or hazardous situations (including near misses) to their 

immediate supervisors. Management is informed and the cases documented. All cases are thoroughly 

investigated and the findings are reviewed by management. Root cause analysis is done and corrective 

measures put in place to avoid future recurrence. 

 

Nam Lee engages both external and in-house safety officers to ensure safety regulations are duly complied 

with. The external safety officer oversees compliance by Nam Lee with national regulations and safety rules 

by conducting spot checks within the premises and proposing improvements where necessary. The in-

house safety officer, on the other hand, monitors the daily safety measures and continuously seeks ways to 

create a safer working environment. The in-house safety officer conducts safety orientation briefings to all 

new employees on topics such as housekeeping rules, proper usage of personal protective equipment, and 

safe operation of machinery as well as material handling procedures.

OUR RESPONSE DURING COVID-19 

 

Our Employees 

 

Since FY2020, Nam Lee has complied with the safe distancing requirements and safe management 

measures for workplaces in Singapore and Malaysia. Flexible working hours have been implemented, 

including allowing employees to leave the work premises at 4pm and to commute during off-peak hours. 

Heads of Department (HOD) are involved in the assessment and review of work arrangements for their 

departments’ employees so as to establish suitable schedules such as alternate week buddy working system, 

or work from home for those who need to look after their family. The Company gave free face masks, 

Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits and hand-sanitizers to all employees. Those who require additional supplies 

can request for more from the HR department. Employees who report to work onsite are encouraged to 

self-test twice a week via an ART. 

 

To ensure the health and safety of our employees we had virtual meetings in place of physical meetings 

with our suppliers and customers, whenever possible. We minimised social gatherings within the workplaces, 

increased the frequency of cleaning of common spaces in our offices and implemented daily checks for 

temperature and respiratory symptoms. Use of TraceTogether and SafeEntry to record the entry of all 

personnel (including employees and visitors) entering the workplace has been implemented to enable the 

national effort of tracing potential transmission chains. 

 

No employees were retrenched during FY2021 and our hiring rate in FY2021 has increased compared to 

FY2020.  

 

During FY2021, employees were encouraged to attend online courses which were relevant to their work. 

The objective was to equip employees at all levels with the knowledge and skills required for their roles as 

well as to keep up to date with new platforms or software that would now be more important for them as 

they continue to work remotely. 

 

 

 

 

 


 

24 

 

Our Customers and Suppliers  

 

During certain phases of the pandemic, several Movement Control Orders were imposed in Malaysia and 

elsewhere. Some of our suppliers from China and Malaysia were impacted by the lockdowns implemented 

within their countries which in turn affected our supply chain. To ensure that there was sufficient supply of 

materials available to meet customer demand, we placed advance order purchases with our suppliers to 

reduce the risk of material shortage. This allowed us to run our operations with minimal interruptions and to 

fulfil orders or projects for our customers.
