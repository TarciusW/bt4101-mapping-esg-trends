to promote a healthy lifestyle among our 

employees, we organise health and wellness 

activities such as biking, hiking, and lunch 

gathering. Activities that allow its employees 

to interact with each other to promote esprit 

de corp in our group are also organised by the 

Company.

the group believes in equal opportunity 

and shall remain guided by the principles 

of meritocracy and fairness in all decisions 

regarding employment, benefits, rewards, and 

professional development of its employees. it 

practices non-discrimination in terms of race, 

nationality, age, religion, gender, physical 

abilities or political beliefs.

the Azeus Equal opportunity Policy ensures 

strong commitment to equal opportunity, and 

believes in treating people with dignity and 

providing equal employment and advancement 

opportunities for all. its policy applies to all terms 

and conditions of employment, and stipulates 

no discrimination against or harassment of any 

employee or job applicant. internal procedures 

for any grievances and disciplinary matters are 

set up, and individuals may approach relevant 

group Human Resource directors in their local 

areas. employees also have the right to pursue 

complaints of discrimination to an industrial

based on the nature of our business, we do not 

support nor allow the employment of minors.

We believe in making a positive impact in the 

communities we operate in, and we invest in and 

support different initiatives. For example, Azeus 

provides scholarships for select students and 

offers on-the-job training to college students to 

expose them to the it industry. 

Charity also plays a big role in Azeus’ 

commitment to good citizenship. employees 

receive 

support 

when 

they 

volunteer 

in 

community projects, fund-raising, or sponsored 

charitable endeavours. Azeus directly sponsors 

and/or donates to various charity organisations, 

and gives reusable and recyclable materials and 

equipment to charitable bodies. 

As employees make the company, Azeus gives 

value to its workers. employees are able to take 

sabbatical leave, providing them with financial 

allowances or stipends, for activities such as 

teaching in universities. the company also 

offers overseas secondment opportunities to 

employees.  

since 

Convene 

advocates 

for 

paperless 

meetings, we launched an initiative aligned 

with our values. For World environment day, 

we made a donation to the World land trust in 

the united Kingdom to protect rain forests. We 

purchased and protected an acre of threatened 

wilderness habitat and all its wildlife on behalf 

of our customers, who had saved an equivalent 

number of trees by using Convene from April 

2016. our goal is to plant a tree for every tree 

saved by our customers as a result of not printing 

documents.
