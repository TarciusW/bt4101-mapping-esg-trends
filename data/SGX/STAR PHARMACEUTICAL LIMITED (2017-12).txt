1.2 Message to stakeholders 

On behalf of our Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present our 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 

(FY2017). 

FY2017 was a challenging year as reforms in the national medical 

and health system affected production circulation in the 

pharmaceutical industry as well as the Group’s products and 

production line. To cope with these, as well as a decline in the 

antibiotics injection market, the Group focused on consistency 

evaluation studies of products, continued R&amp;D and obtaining R&amp;D 

approval for many upcoming inhalant products, as well as 

commenced blow-fill-seal (BFS) production line for packing new 

inhalant products. The Group also improved sales system by 

reorganising our sales team, decentralising management of 

provinces, and enhancing management concentration. These not only 

contributed to the Group’s stronger revenue growth in FY2017 but 

also built a strong foundation for our future. 

As part of our corporate social responsibility efforts, the Group 

became research cooperative partners with College of Life Sciences 

of Hainan Normal University to offer internships for students. In 

addition, the Group conducted activities at various government 

authorities and institutions including Hainan Technician Institute, 

Haikou College of Economics, Haikou University of Political Science 

and Law, Haikou Technology and Business University, Hainan 

Software Profession Institute and many more. From these 

collaborative efforts, the Group recruited more than 60 promising 

employees and trainees to bolster its capabilities and competitive 

edge for the next phase of growth.  

Although the Group did not launch any new products in FY2017, we 

started and completed R&amp;D approval for six new products, and will 

continue to focus on R&amp;D of our inhalant products. The Group also 

seeks to optimise our production through the implementation of GMP 

transformation projects to reduce production costs and improve risk 

management and control capabilities. 

In our inaugural sustainability report, we will be reporting on the 

Group’s sustainability efforts based on our four pillars of sustainable 

development, comprising Economic Contribution, Drug Quality and 

Safety, Environmental Sustainability, and Social Contribution. 

In addition, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered 

sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined 

the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and 

overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG 

factors. 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors 

 

 

 

XU ZHIBIN 

Executive Chairman

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts 

of our business, with dedicated teams for each focus area, and 

coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance 

against metrics, and evaluating how well the programs have 

advanced, through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four 

focus areas outlined in our sustainability strategy. As this is our first 

year adopting sustainability reporting, we will be establishing 

quantitative targets within the next year to hold ourselves accountable 

and track how we are doing. 

Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to 

ensure alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability program in place, we will 

also publish the key initiatives we plan to implement within the next 

year.

3.2 Economic contribution 

Overview 

As stated in our Company mission, we are dedicated to 

creating healthier lives through medical innovation. 

Backed by our intensive research and development 

(R&amp;D) efforts, our broad range of pharmaceutical 

products have benefitted countless patients throughout 

the years.  

Extensive distribution network 

We produce a broad range of pharmaceutical products, including 

antibiotics, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs, available in 

different administration forms and dosages. This hence improves the 

usage convenience of our drugs by a wide range of patients. 

In FY2017, we achieved sales ¥93.3 million through our established 

sales and distribution network consisting of approximately 420 

distributors, distributing to more than 8,700 hospitals, clinics and 

pharmacies. These distributors are supported by our 37 liaison offices 

located in major provinces and cities in the PRC, enabling us to 

distribute our products quickly and extensively to various medical 

institutions throughout the country. 

Focus on R&amp;D 

Our intensive R&amp;D efforts are backed by an experienced in-house 

R&amp;D team, holding various academic qualifications in pharmacy, 

pharmaceutical engineering, medicine analysis and medical study. 

The R&amp;D team is complemented by collaborations with research 

institutes in the PRC, including the College of Life Sciences of Hainan 

Normal University, Hainan Technician Institute, Haikou Technology 

and Business University, and Hainan Software Profession Institute. 

In FY2017, R&amp;D spending amounted to ¥13.1 million with ¥12.7 

million spent on R&amp;D projects and ¥0.4 million spent on R&amp;D 

expenses.  

The PRC government also awards grants to small and medium 

pharmaceutical manufacturers in the PRC to fund the development of 

pharmaceutical products. Such government grants are only awarded 

to enterprises who fulfill certain criteria such as being involved in the 

development and manufacture of technologically advanced products, 

being of a good financial position, having a good financial 

management structure in place, as well as possessing a management 

team with strong market exploitation capabilities. 

In FY2017, we received grants amounting to ¥1.1 million for the R&amp;D 

of new products.  

In addition, we hold 5 patents used in the production of our drugs and 

obtained production approvals for a total of 104 pharmaceutical 

products, all of which are prescription drugs. Currently, we 

manufacture and sell 52 of these 104 pharmaceutical products. We 

are in the process of conducting informal market surveys and 

research on some of the new pharmaceutical products and may 

commence production and sale of some of these products pending 

the outcome of the market surveys and research.

3.3 Drug quality and safety 

Overview 

Drug quality and safety are core to our commercial 

reputation and consumers’ expectations. We are 

committed to responsible sourcing as it helps assure 

safety and quality of our end products.  

We have always stressed the importance of drug quality 

and safety in our operations in each stage of our 

production process as evidenced by the GMP 

certifications over our production facilities. 

GMP certification 

GMP is a set of standards in respect of quality management of 

pharmaceutical products and their manufacturing industry. It 

encompasses requirements on personnel, plant and equipment and 

various management systems of production organisation, such as 

production processes, hygiene standards and education level. These 

are applicable to the entire pharmaceutical production process and 

the key working procedures for the production of raw materials which 

affect the quality of finished medicine products. 

In August 1999, the State Food and Drug Administration of the PRC  

(国家食品药品监督管理局)(SFDA) implemented a GMP certification 

system in pharmaceutical manufacturing to enhance its regulation on 

pharmaceutical production enterprises. 

Since August 2002, all our production lines are fully compliant with 

the GMP requirements of the SFDA. We have implemented a quality 

assurance system and instituted quality control procedures 

throughout our entire manufacturing process in accordance with GMP 

requirements to ensure the quality of our products, including the 

safety and effectiveness of their use. 

Quality supply chain 

We purchase entirely from reliable local suppliers. We believe that a 

secure and stable supply chain is very important to ensure the 

smooth and uninterrupted operation of our production activities. 

We conduct checks on the quality of raw materials procured on a 

sampling basis. Only raw materials that meet our quality requirements 

will be used in the manufacture of our products. Raw materials which 

do not meet our quality requirements will be returned to the relevant 

supplier. 

In addition, our quality assurance team regularly visits our raw 

material suppliers to conduct on-site assessment of their quality 

assurance system to assess whether their quality assurance system 

meet our requirements. The assessment covers the operation of their 

quality assurance system and overall assessment of their 

manufacturing facilities in order to ensure that our suppliers have the 

capability to provide to us raw materials of the required quality. We 

will only procure raw materials from suppliers who meet our quality 

requirements.

Ensuring production quality 

Quality management in our production process is as follows. 

 

Pre-production 

Before commencing production, we conduct strict 

checks on the production area to ensure that the 

production environment is free from contamination 

and meets our strict cleanliness standards. This 

includes checks on dust particles in the air 

purifying system, temperature, humidity, bacteria, 

microorganisms on the surface of key work areas.  

In addition, we also conduct checks and inspection 

on water, compressed gas and steam used in the 

manufacture of our products and conduct regular 

inspections to ensure that our manufacturing 

equipment meet our strict cleanliness standards. 

All production staff are required to undergo training 

and all staff must observe strict hygiene standards 

within the production area so as to ensure that the 

production environment is free from contamination 

and meet our strict cleanliness standards. In 

addition, health checks are also conducted on all 

staff annually.  

 

Production 

During production, the various production 

processes are carried out according to the 

requirements stipulated for the product as well as 

specifications stated in the production orders.  

Production operators are required to strictly adhere 

to work operation procedures and equipment 

operation procedures. The production operators 

will monitor the entire production process and 

quality assurance inspectors will inspect the 

production equipment and process. Any 

abnormalities discovered will be rectified 

immediately and reported. 

 

Quality control inspection 

After production, the products are placed at the 

inspection area according to product name, 

specifications and batch number. Full inspections 

carried out on the various products are based on 

standards which meet state requirements. 

After the inspection, our quality assurance 

department will issue a report on the finished 

products and only products which pass our quality 

assurance inspections are sent to the warehouse. 

Products which fail our quality assurance 

inspections will be disposed off accordingly.

process, production control, production records 

and inspection records. If no abnormalities are 

detected, the product approval slip is issued. The 

warehouse will release products upon receipt of 

both the finished product report and the products 

approval slip so as to ensure that the products are 

100% qualified. 

 

GMP compliance 

In addition, we will carry out internal checks to 

ensure compliance with GMP requirements and the 

results of these checks are analysed and problems 

relating to product quality will be rectified. The 

results will be promptly submitted to the 

management so as to ensure effective operation of 

the quality assurance system. 

We also retain a sample of each batch of finished 

products for control purposes and for future testing. 

We regularly monitor these samples over the shelf 

life of the product for any deterioration in quality. 

We seek to continue our track record of zero drug safety incidents, 

serious incidents and workplace injuries in the coming year.

3.4 Environmental sustainability 

Overview 

Environmental protection is fast gaining traction in China 

amongst policy makers and the public. As one of the 

leading pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, we are 

committed to ensuring our full compliance with national 

environmental regulations.  

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure our 

commitment towards environmental protection, reducing 

carbon emissions, preventing pollution, and minimising 

waste can be achieved during our daily operations.  

Environmental policy in China 

Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's 

Congress and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection 

of the People's Republic of China. The central government issues 

strict regulations for which the actual monitoring and enforcement is 

largely undertaken by the local governments. 

In January 2015, a new environmental law came into effect, covering 

land, water and air pollution. It contains strict penalties, including 

seizing of the property of illegal polluters, with company executives 

subject to prison sentences of 15 days. There is no upper limit on 

fines. More than 300 different groups will be able to sue on the behalf 

of people harmed by pollution. 

StarPharm is fully compliant with China’s environmental policy.  

Emissions reduction 

The corporate culture of protecting the environment is reflected in 

every operation undertaken by the Group. 

We are committed to positive action on climate change and dedicated 

to reducing the carbon emission in our daily operations. Employees 

are reminded to save electricity and fuel consumption through regular 

internal communications.  

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for measuring corporate 

greenhouse gas emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 

100% of the emissions associated with businesses which we directly 

control. Our carbon footprint includes:  

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity used in our facilities (Scope 2 

emissions)

In FY2017, the Group generated a carbon footprint of 5,748.5 tonnes 

of carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e) with a carbon emission intensity 

of 57.9 tCO2e per million yuan of revenue. The emission mainly arises 

from direct fuel (i.e. diesel for generators and petrol for vehicles) used 

in the production process, which accounted for almost 67% of the 

total carbon emission of the Group. 

 

We will continue to monitor the performance on carbon emission 

reduction. Progress and performance on the reduction of carbon 

emission will be reported in the following year.  

Energy efficiency 

Due to our manufacturing activities, direct fuel and electricity 

constitutes a significant proportion of our operating expenses. By 

investing in energy efficiency, we not only help protect the 

environment but can also lower our financial costs. 

The Group’s fuel consumption came from diesel for generators and 

petrol for vehicles. In FY2017, the fuel consumption intensity of the 

Group is 14,700 litres (l) per million yuan of revenue.  

The Group’s electricity consumption came from regular operations of the 

office and factory. In FY2017, the electricity consumption intensity of the 

Group is 25.0 megawatt-hours (MWh) per million yuan of revenue.  

To ensure the effective use of fuel and electricity, the Group 

conducted the following practices: 

• 

Use energy saving equipment  

• 

Regular maintenance of production equipment, especially 

boilers, to maintain high efficiency 

• 

Using high quality diesel to ensure energy efficiency 

• 

Turn off lights, computers and air conditioning system before 

clocking out  

• 

Place energy saving reminder labels next to switches

Wastewater management 

Wastewater is passed through an in-house wastewater treatment 

facility fitted with biological treatment tanks. As a result, the treated 

wastewater discharge will be able to meet the requirements of the 

water emission standard of Qionghai City. The municipal 

environmental protection bureau obtains wastewater samples from 

the facility at least four times a year to ensure that discharge 

standards are met.  

We seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our wastewater 

discharge meet the local emission standards in the coming year.  

In FY2017, the Group had a wastewater discharge intensity of 400l 

per million yuan of revenue.  

Hazardous waste management 

Hazardous waste from the production of our drugs is aggregated in a 

locked and isolated container and disposed through proper biohazard 

disposal channels.  

In FY2017, the Group had a hazardous waste disposal intensity of 

11.1 kilograms (kg) per million yuan of revenue. 

Saving water 

Water scarcity is a growing concern around the world and a serious 

global challenge that we must work together to address. This is even 

a greater concern to us, given that water is also an essential input in 

the food industry, from cleaning and sanitation to manufacturing.  

In FY2017, the Group had a water consumption intensity of 1,300l per 

million yuan of revenue. Where possible, the Group already has 

procedures in place to reduce water usage in our production lines. 

Our employees are also reminded of the importance to save water in 

their daily activities. 

We will continue to monitor the performance on the water 

consumption reduction. Progress and performance on the reduction 

on water consumption will be reported in the following year.

3.5 Social contribution 

Overview 

Employees are the integral part of our competitive 

advantage and our sustainability agenda. We strive to 

invest in training and create an enjoyable working 

environment to our employees. Our human resources 

team develops, evolves and champions our human 

‘capital’ through training, evaluation, remuneration, and 

engagement.  

Through our people, we are also committed in making 

positive contributions to our community by giving back to 

the society and helping the less privileged. 

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employee excel, we emphasise on continuous 

learning in the workplace. Every employee has equal opportunities to 

upgrade and sharpen their skill sets through formal and on-the-job 

internal training programs. 

The Company also emphasises on internal leadership development, 

and places great importance on developing a network of new-

generation leaders who would play an important role in driving the 

business in the future. 

In FY2017, the Group held a total of 47 training sessions on topics 

ranging from GMP and quality control, to fire safety and government 

regulations. We seek to continue this practice in the coming year. 

Performance appraisal 

To ensure the Company achieves its goals, we have various 

performance appraisal methods in place to determine the 

performance of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable 

evaluation criteria. In addition, we actively collects performance 

information for each employee each month through inputs from direct 

supervisors and feedbacks, as well as periodical employee 

communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance 

and skills development needs of each team and individual employee 

from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop 

annual training programs for employees that are designed to enhance 

their skills and improve overall productivity.  

In FY2017, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual 

performance appraisal by their superiors. We seek to continue this 

practice in the coming year.

Equal opportunity 

We have always been an equal opportunity employer to provide a fair 

workplace for employees, following the principles of equality and non-

discrimination. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and benefits 

are required to be handled based on objective assessment, equal 

opportunity and non-discrimination regardless of gender, race, marital 

status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status.  

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that 

includes recruitment application, job description, job applications, 

interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on 

performance and suitability.  

We offer competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff 

members. Remuneration packages (which includes the necessary 

social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with 

employment market. Dismissal also complies with employment laws 

and regulations relating to non-discrimination. 

In 2017, female employees comprise 64% of our entire workforce, 

with female representation in management at 31%. 

Encouraging work-life balance 

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee 

health and improve employee work-life balance, the Group has been 

organising periodic employee gatherings during major festivals and 

sports competitions. This helps the employees relax their mind and 

body, develop teamwork, explore their talent, so as to develop a 

positive attitude in both work and life. 

Community initiatives 

In FY2017, our Group made cash donations totaling ¥34,000 to 

various village committee and alumni associations to fund their 

cultural engagement activities.  

The Group will continue to invest in the above and other initiatives 

supporting community building.
