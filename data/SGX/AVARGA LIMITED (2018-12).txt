Message from the Board 

 

Dear Stakeholders, on behalf of the board, I am pleased to announce the publication of our 

2018 Sustainability Report (”SR”) of Avarga Limited (the “Company”, and together with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group” or “Avarga”) which is our second SR. It is prepared with reference 

to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 2016: Core Option and in alignment with 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules – Sustainability 

Reporting Guide, in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”).   

 

FY2018 has been a fruitful year for us as we continue to record satisfactory performances 

despite the challenging economic situation. As such, we believe in adaptability and resilience 

to the ever-changing conditions. We believe that these factors are necessary in creating a 

sustainable growth environment.  

 

Our core products such as paper and power have always been essential to mankind and its 

uses have accelerated since the industrial revolution. As such, sustainability of this essential 

resource has never been so highly discussed in today’s age. At Avarga, our stakeholders can 

be rest assured that the procurement of resources, materials and energy generates the 

smallest impact to the environment and the local community. This demonstrates our 

unwavering support and commitment of sustainability to our stakeholders.  

 

We have business operations and assets that span across Malaysia, Myanmar and Canada. 

Our core businesses include paper manufacturing, power generation and building materials 

distribution in these places. With an employment of more than 600 staff and a total annual 

revenue of $1.5 billion, our stakeholders can be assured that we are well poised in our current 

position to tackle any challenges that lie ahead, 2019 and beyond.  

 

As part of our strategic formulation process, the board have determined the material 

Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) factors and have overseen the management 

and monitoring of the relevant ESG factors. The material factors chosen are strategically 

chosen, and have the largest impact on our shareholders.

Organisation Profile 

Avarga Limited (“Avarga” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) are an established 

investment holding company that specialises in the optimisation of return of equities through 

building sustainable value to our shareholders. We build business models that are long-term, 

focusing on competitive advantages, good management and innovation.  

 

Headquartered in Singapore and listed on the mainboard of the SGX Exchange since 1980 

under the ISIN code of SG1K55001665, we have three core businesses and operate in                     

5 countries. These businesses generate sustainable cash flows, progressively diverting into 

other investments. Our three main businesses are as follow: 

 

Paper Manufacturing (Malaysia) 

 

The Group's pulp and paper mill in Ijok, Malaysia (UPP Pulp &amp; Paper (M) Sdn Bhd), is one of 

the five largest in Malaysia, producing almost 10% of Malaysia’s domestic output of brown 

packaging paper. We produce industrial grade papers such as Testliner, Corrugated Medium, 

Chip Boards, just to name a few. Our paper mill is one of the most cost-efficient in the country, 

and in 2015, we have invested another RM2.4 million to increase capacity and operational 

efficiency.  

 

Power Generation (Myanmar)  

 

Our power plant in Myanmar is one of Myanmar’s first foreign-owned independent power 

producers and accounts for almost 2% of the local total power generation. Located in Ywama, 

Insein township, 25km northeast of Yangon, Myanmar, our 50MW gas-fired power plant is 

contracted to sell a minimum of 350 million kilowatt hours (“kWh”) per year for a duration of 

30 years to the Myanmar Government. As electrification rates in Myanmar remains low, the 

appetite for power consumption will continue to grow as the country develops and 

industrialises.  

 

Building Materials Distribution (Taiga, Canada)  

 

Taiga Building Products Ltd. (“Taiga”) is Canada’s largest wholesale distributor of building 

materials such as lumber, panels, moulding, sidings, engineering wood flooring and many 

others, and has an annual sale of over C$1.4 billion. As Canada has a low population density 

and large land mass, the wholesale distribution model is essential to Taiga and the Group. Our 

customers include Home Depot, Lowe’s, Rona, and Home Hardware and collectively they 

have total sales of more than C$150 billion annually, with an outreach of more than 5000 

stores in just Canada alone.

MATERIALITY

ASSESSMENT

In 2017, an extensive

list of ESG topics –

generated through

internal interviews with

senior management

and benchmarking of

selected peers – were

ranked.

Following that, the

top 4 material topics

were presented to and

approved by the Board.

REVIEW

In 2018, the material

topics were reviewed to

ensure their continued

relevance and then

aligned across all business

divisions and have included

another 3 more material

Supply Chain Management  

 

Our suppliers are extensively sourced and stringently evaluated to ensure that they meet the 

relevant specific guidelines that is in place, following the mission plan of the Company. We 

aim to source only from ethical, responsible and cost-effective suppliers and minimise the 

potential disruptions, such as the provisions of raw materials in the supply chain.  

Machinery parts and scrap materials used for our paper mill in Malaysia are sourced 

extensively to ensure that they are equipped with the latest technology to increase efficiency 

in brown paper production. New, more highly energy efficient generators are also used in our 

power plant in Myanmar, to ensure efficient gas utilisation and that energy generated does 

not go to waste.  

Our building materials distribution in Canada, Taiga are relatively resilient in growth and 

revenue due to our strategic management planning, which includes Taiga’s growing market 

share, addition of more products into our distribution channel, expansion of our exports, 

especially to places such as China, and more proactive trading.  

Looking ahead, the Group will continue to procure and seek out new and innovative ways to 

better manage its suppliers, resources and end products.

External Initiatives  

The Group believes in contributing towards driving positive and sustainable changes for the 

benefit of the local communities where we operate and the society as a whole. 

At present, our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts are largely focused on Myanmar, where 

we see room to help improve living and education standards. 

In our FY2017 SR, we reported that we identified a government primary school near our 

power plant, namely No. 16 Basic Education Primary School, Insein Township, Yangon.                 

In 2015, we replaced two-thirds of the school’s old furniture with new desks and chairs to 

accommodate some 200 pupils per session. In 2016, we took a major step to further improve 

conditions for the school. We spent US$50,000 to construct a new 900 sq ft air-conditioned 

multi-media hall, and equipped it with 31 sets of new computers, accessories, desks and 

chairs. We hope to equip the pupils with better computer and literacy skills and at the same 

time, help cultivate a stronger learning culture. 

In 2017, we identified another government school that was in need of funds for repair,            

No. 149 Basic Education Post-Primary School in Kanyatgyi Village, Kanma Township, Magway 

Region. The school which is located some 400 miles from Yangon, has 177 students aged 5 to 

13. We have completed the construction of a new 2,700 sq ft school building.  

We are pleased to report that in 2018, we have donated US$8,000 to No. 16 Basic Education 

Primary School, Ywama, Insein Township, Yangon Region for the construction of the school 

hall and meal area. We also gave all 830 students of the school a set of uniform, books, and a 

school bag. Additionally, we have also donated a set of uniform, books and school bags for 

each of the 203 students of No. 149 Basic Education Post-Primary School in Kanyatgyi Village,

Economic Performance  

In the financial year (“FY”) ended 31 December 2018, our group is pleased to announce that 

we achieved total revenue of approximately S$1572.7 million, a substantial 8% increase 

compared to FY 2017. The net profit after income tax for FY 2018 increased by S$5.19 million 

or 35%, amounting to approximately S$20.1 million. 

 

At Avarga, we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders. We are 

achieving this by maintaining significant positions in our respective core markets. We invest 

heavily in our entities in Malaysia, Myanmar and Canada, giving both the financial support 

and administrative support necessary. This is to ensure we firmly plant ourselves as pioneers 

and forerunners in their respective businesses.  

 

Innovation is central in our businesses, and central to maintain sustainable value creation.  

We are continuously leveraging on innovation to deliver value through efficiency, such as in 

our paper manufacturing plant in Malaysia, where we continue to invest in upgrading our 

machinery which reduces the cost of maintenance and increases output with the same given 

level of energy used.   

 

We have also invested heavily into sourcing for new vendors for building materials for Taiga. 

This ensures that we have a reliable stream of suppliers to weather any possible economic 

challenges that we might potentially face, and also to have a first mover’s advantage in any 

potential new market situations. This can be seen in our FY2018 metrics, where we 

outperformed our results for FY2017.  

 

We aspire to become a successful investment vehicle, to find and invest into profitable new 

opportunities. We strive to achieve similar results for FY2019 and beyond.

equal opportunities to achieve their full potential. 

Appraisals and Evaluation 

All employees and staff will go through an annual appraisal for assessment and evaluation,   

so that the Group is able to recognise the contributions and talents of its employees and staff. 

This is to acknowledge the talents of its staff, and to further develop their skills and holistic 

well-being via trainings, promotion or workshops. 

The Group treasures talent, and hope to retain productive employees with the necessary skills 

and the right attitude.  

 

Diversity and Fair Practices  

 

The Group’s employees and staff are its most valuable assets. The Group hires based on talent 

rather than class privilege and wealth. The Group employs the best talent for the job, and also 

ensures that there is a healthy mix of men and women in the workplace.

Occupational Health and Safety

The Group has always strived to reinforce health and safety, which is of the highest 

paramount. It is always committed to upholding the stringent and rigorous standards of 

Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”), and ensuring that a culture of health and safety is 

integrated throughout the Group and its stakeholders.  

Organisation Safety 

The Group’s OHS-related policies are set out to create a healthy and safe environment for all 

its employees to work in. At the Group level, the Company has adopted policies such as fire 

protection, hygiene and sanitation in handling equipment to ensure that there will be no cross 

contamination in its paper mill or paper processing plants. Insurance, paid for by the Group 

to all employees and staff is also made available to them as well. The Group strives to conform 

to international recognised standards and codes such as OHSAS 18001 as well as comply with 

local legislation relating to health and safety.   

In addition, there the Group also mandates that proper Personal Protective Equipment 

(“PPE”) are to be worn by staff at all time as long as they are handling heavy equipment and 

operating machinery.  

We place great importance to accident reports. Any injury suffered by employee, no matter 

how serious it is, must be immediately reported to their manager or supervisor. The manager 

or supervisor will assess the severity of the accident and will decide on the appropriate action 

to be taken. It is compulsory for all incidents to be documented, reported and submitted to 

management.  

We have also established a safety committee for UPP Pulp &amp; Paper (M) Sdn Bhd to overlook 

safety requirement and all incidents in the workplace, which includes feedback channels and 

safety and health meetings. In addition, feedback channels are set up for safety and health 

complaints, suggestions from the employees. The input and safety matters are discussed in 

safety and health meetings held periodically. Led by our committee chairman, Mr. Ng Chun 

Keong, this ensures that management is well aware of the incidents that occur and we work 

actively to reduce or eliminate them. Please refer to the chart on the next page detailing the 

structure of our safety committee:

Training and Education 

At Avarga, we believe in ensuring that our employees are adequately trained and kept relevant 

of any updates and advances in their specific and relevant job positions. Every new employee 

must go through an orientation programme to familiarise themselves with their job position and 

embrace the company culture. This ensures that they are able to perform their jobs efficiently 

and effectively.  

We have developed human resource policies that promote planned and comprehensive training 

for all employees so that they can meet and exceed performance standards. The Group also 

encourages its employees to take ownership of their skills development and learning. We set 

aside a fund for our employees to attend courses and seminars to improve their personal and 

work skills. Our employees also undergo regular performance feedback and guidance with their 

supervisors and managers during the course of their employment to allow their supervisors to 

highlight areas for improvement and to commend employees where they have excelled.   

Staff are given both orientation training and adequate on-the-job training to upgrade or to 

reinforce their specific skill sets at work in anticipation in the ever-changing and dynamic industry.   

As our employees are our greatest assets, we also believe that employee well-being is essential 

towards the daily functionality of the Company. We believe that our employees must be healthy 

and happily engaged at work for them to maximise their potential and productivity. Our 

employees enjoy a comprehensive work benefits package which includes health screenings and 

medical insurance coverage.

Environmental Compliance 

We as a group are sensitive to the environmental impact across our business operations, and are 

committed to taking steps to reduce the impact, especially in the waste generated and 

Greenhouse Gases (“GHG”). Energy consumption used is managed and monitored by our various 

business units worldwide.  

 

Policies and Practices  

The Group’s Environmental Preservation Policy is designed to make sure that the operations in 

which the Group has a stake in are carried out in mind of preserving the environment. We comply 

with all environmental rules and regulations that are required by the relevant local authorities.  

 

 

 

We are also constantly looking to improve our policies and practices to go over and ensure that 

we minimise our environmental impact. Practices such as the introduction of segregation of 

waste materials from our paper mill in Malaysia, and reducing the amount of plastic packaging 

that we use on our building materials for our building materials distribution business for Taiga. 

This in turn will improve the efficiency of waste removal, encourages recycling and conservation 

of resources.   

 

Additionally, Taiga is committed to operating its facilities in an environmentally responsible 

manner, as well as in compliance with federal, state, provincial, local environmental and 

occupational health and safety laws and regulation, including requirements relating to air 

emissions, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances, wastewater and storm 

water discharge, ownership and operation of underground storage tanks and clean-up of 

contaminated soil and groundwater. Management believes that Taiga is in material compliance 

with such applicable laws and regulation. All three of Taiga's "Envirofor Preservers" treating plants 

have achieved the highest standard in Canada by being certified by Environment Canada and 

Wood Preservations Canada.  

 

We are proud to announce that as of FY2018, there were no instances in the Group being 

penalised for any non-compliance of any environmental rules and regulations.

agencies and regulators to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements in the regions 

which the Group operates.  

Management is committed to make regular periodic reports and update to the relevant local and 

foreign government authorities in the regions that the Group operates.  

We have zero tolerance for any financial crime including corruption and bribery. We seek to 

conduct our business in a responsible manner by ensuring that our policies and code of conduct 

are implemented and communicated to all our employees, business partners and board members 

consistently throughout our entire global operations.
