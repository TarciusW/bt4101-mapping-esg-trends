Chairman &amp; CEO Message 

Dear Stakeholders,  

We are pleased to present our third 

Sustainability 

Report, 

prepared 

in 

accordance with the Core option of the 

Global 

Reporting 

Initiative 

(“GRI”) 

Standards.  

Sustainability continues to be a widely 

discussed issue both locally and globally. 

At Hiap Hoe Limited (“Hiap Hoe” or “the 

Group”), 

we 

acknowledge 

the 

importance of being sustainable. Thinking 

about sustainability is essential to the 

strategy of any business, including ours. 

We will continue to drive our operations in 

the 

direction 

which 

can 

contribute 

positively to all of our stakeholders.  

The Report provides an avenue for us to 

keep our stakeholders informed about our 

sustainability 

performance 

in 

an 

accountable and transparent manner. It 

also highlights the Group’s strategies, 

policies, practices, performances and 

targets, for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 

December 2019 (“FY2019”), in relation to 

the economic, environmental, social and 

governance factors as stated in the GRI 

standards.  

For FY2019, we have identified 13 GRI 

disclosures which represent material issues 

that affect our stakeholders and our 

business the most. These material issues 

were 

identified 

through 

careful 

consideration, 

based 

on 

our 

four 

sustainability strategies – Business Integrity, 

Environmental 

Sustainability, 

Human 

Capital and Health &amp; Safety.  

 

 

 

 

 

Based on the performance for this year, 

we are pleased to announce that we 

have met most of the targets set in FY2018.  

Hiap Hoe will continue to consider 

sustainability issues as part of our strategic 

formulation and operations across the 

Group. We appreciate having all our 

stakeholders on this journey together with 

us, to build a more sustainable future. 102-

Our Approach to Sustainability 

MATERIALITY REVIEW PROCESS 102-46 102-47 

We applied the GRI reporting principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, the sustainability 

context, materiality and completeness – in defining the report content by considering the 

Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of our stakeholders. 

Performed in consultation with external consultants, the relevant topics and indicators 

that we have covered in our Sustainability Report were selected based on our review of 

the Group’s vision, mission and core values strategic direction, and the economic, 

environmental and social impacts which were most significant. 

From this process, 13* indicators from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016, 

were identified as relevant and material to the operations of Hiap Hoe. The materiality 

assessment was subsequently endorsed by Hiap Hoe’s Executive Sustainability Committee. 

*Fire safety is our main concern when it comes to the health and safety of our employees and customers. The topic of employee and 

customer health and safety were covered under GRI 403-2 and GRI 416-02 respectively in the FY2018 report. We have decided to address 

the concerns together for FY2019 under GRI 416-02.

ELECTRICITY  

Property Rental – Hiap Hoe Building Office Tower and Zhongshan Mall 

Electricity consumption for Hiap Hoe Building office tower and Zhongshan Mall is tracked 

and monitored using the central meter readings taken on a monthly basis. The data 

below relates to the electricity consumption of the 13-storey office tower and the 2-storey 

mall. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hospitality – Ramada and Days Hotel 

Energy consumption for Ramada and Days hotel is tracked and monitored using 

information from monthly electricity bills or daily meter readings.  

We have met our FY2018 target to reduce energy consumption in FY2019. Total electricity 

consumed in FY2019 was 8,104 kWh for both hotels, which is a decrease of 189 kWh or 2% 

from FY2018. The measures taken to reduce electricity consumption includes constant 

review of temperature settings of our air-conditioning units as well as regular servicing of 

the equipment to ensure that the air-conditioners are running efficiently and effectively.

Environmental Sustainability 

Hiap Hoe was awarded the BCA (Green Mark Gold) Certification for Ramada on 15th 

August 2018 (valid for 3 years). This award is a green building rating system used to 

evaluate a building for its environmental impact and performance. Hence, it is a 

testament to the building’s environmental friendliness.   

Nonetheless, there is room for us to improve our hotel buildings energy performance, 

balancing operational needs with the need to be environmentally responsible citizens. 

Based on the BCA Building Energy Benchmarking Report 2019, energy use intensity* (“EUI”) 

– which measures the total energy consumed in a building in a year – for our hotels is 

higher compared to the average EUI of large hotel buildings in Singapore.  

 

 

 

* Energy Use Intensity is measured by the total electricity used within a building in a year, expressed as kilowatt hour (kWh), 

per gross floor area (m2). The EUI calculated for Ramada is 306 kWh/ m2 (4,380,000kWh/14,304m2), and 283 kWh/ m2 

(3,724,000kWh/13,147sqm) Days Hotel. 

 

Ramada and Days Hotel EUI is calculated to be 306kWh/m2* and 283kWh/m2* 

respectively.   

The following reasons contribute to Hiap Hoe’s EUI being higher than the industry average. 

Both hotels use of a Variable Refrigerant Volume (“VRV”) system. This is a less efficient 

system as compared to the chiller system, which is used by most hotels. In addition, 

another contributor is the ballroom dimmer lights which consumes more electricity. 

However, we are currently unable to replace them due to existing infrastructure.  

Hiap Hoe will continue to monitor our energy consumption and work towards reducing it 

to ensure that it meets the industry average.

Environmental Sustainability 

FUEL 

Fuel (Liquified Petroleum) is consumed for cooking in the kitchens of Ramada and Days 

hotel. Our hotels use Liquified Petroleum as it has a higher heating value and enables 

faster cooking at a lower cost. Hence, being more environmentally friendly. 

Total fuel consumption in FY 2019 was 125m3 compared to 110m3 of fuel in FY2018. The 

increase in consumption was due to the opening of a new restaurant at New Ubin 

Zhongshan Park in Ramada.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

REDUCTION OF ENERGY 102-12 302-4   

We are constantly seeking opportunities to help our Group manage energy consumption 

with the hope of reducing overall consumption levels. The following initiatives have been 

implemented in the Ramada and Days Hotel, and the Marina Tower.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Continuous 

monitoring 

of 

weather 

conditions and adjust the temperature 

of air-conditioners to appropriate levels. 

 



On-going projects to replace existing 

florescent lights to LED lights which are 

more energy efficient. 



Ensure that air-conditioning in the 

corridors are turned down to “fan-

mode” during low-occupancy periods 

to conserve electricity. 

Ensuring 

the 

air-

conditioning system are 

regularly maintained and 

serviced

optimise 

efficiency

reduce 

energy consumption.
