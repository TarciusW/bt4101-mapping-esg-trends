ME SSAGE 

T

he past year was marked with global 

uncertainties 

from 

rising 

geopolitical 

tensions and extreme weather events caused 

by climate change. As we step into the next 

financial year, our world is also faced with the 

pressing challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

particularly the impact on the aviation industry. 

Notwithstanding these challenges, corporations 

have a responsibility to push for sustainability 

and implement the positive change that the 

world needs. 

The well-being of our staff is of utmost 

importance to SIAEC. To protect our staff from 

the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has 

taken prompt measures that are aligned with the 

Ministry of Health’s advisories to minimise the 

risk of infection.

Safety remains our foremost priority and is an 

issue close to our hearts. Despite our efforts 

towards safety, we are deeply saddened by a 

workplace fatality in FY2019/20. We are firm in 

our resolve to ensure that our staff return home 

to their families safely and will continually drive 

the message that safety cannot be compromised. 

As part of our commitment to safety, we have 

established a Safety Promotion Centre—the first 

of its kind in the MRO community—to reinforce 

training and heighten staff awareness on safety. 

We have also embarked on the Maintenance Line 

Operations Safety Assessment programme, where 

experienced staff volunteer to proactively identify 

areas of improvement in operations, which are 

then followed up with enhancement initiatives.

Leveraging technology to hone the skills of 

our employees, we introduced the use of 

virtual reality simulations in the training for 

airside 

driving, 

operating 

mobile-elevated 

work platforms and performing other aircraft 

maintenance activities. In recognition of our 

innovative use of technology, we are honoured 

to have once again received several accolades 

from the Changi Airport Group at its Airport 

Safety Awards in 2019. 

We also recognise the need to translate 

commitments into concrete actions in order to 

limit the rise in global temperatures. Following 

last year’s reporting of our carbon emissions, 

we took reference from Singapore’s Paris 

Agreement targets and set a long-term target 

to achieve more than 24.48% reduction in our 

FY2013/14 carbon emissions intensity level by 

2030. To achieve this goal, we have embarked 

on a project to install solar panels on the roofs of 

our buildings and hangars to reduce our reliance 

on energy generated from non-renewable 

sources. We have further identified six United 

Nations Sustainable Development Goals that 

our actions are in support of. 

Against 

the 

backdrop 

of 

technological 

disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic, we 

continue to upskill and reskill our workforce to 

better prepare them for the digital economy 

and eventual recovery from the COVID-19 

situation. Adopting a collaborative approach 

in our training development, we have set up a 

Company Training Committee comprising our 

Management and the unions to jointly define 

the training needs of our people. 

Our training DNA goes beyond our employees. 

Since our partnership with the Singapore Institute 

of Technology in its undergraduate programme 

last year, we have extended our collaboration with 

several other educational institutions to develop 

programmes that will build the talent pool for the 

aviation MRO industry.  

Our Transformation programme has laid the 

foundation for us to continually look at how 

we can do things differently and remain nimble 

in the ever-changing business landscape, 

especially during these unprecedented times 

brought about by COVID-19. We will continue 

to monitor and assess the situation closely, and 

proactively implement prompt measures to 

mitigate the impact.

Materiality Assessment 

We conduct our materiality assessment by first 

identifying the key stakeholders who are critical 

to the business or are affected by SIAEC’s 

operations. The Sustainability Working Group 

then reflects and prioritises the aspects important 

to the stakeholders, structuring the review under 

the categories of Economic, Environment, Social 

and Governance. 

The material topics that are assessed to be 

relevant to SIAEC have been reviewed and 

endorsed by the Management Committee and 

the Board.

The United Nations has set out a vision for 

people and the planet and developed 17 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be 

achieved by 2030. Recognising that businesses 

are integral to the achievement of these goals, 

we have reviewed the aspects important to the 

Company and our stakeholders against the SDGs 

and identified six SDGs that our sustainability 

practices are in support of.

Transformation 

We started our Transformation journey in 

2018 and have achieved positive results. The 

implementation of high-impact initiatives in the 

key business units such as Base Maintenance and 

Line Maintenance has resulted in operational and 

financial improvements.

The Company also embarked on an organisation 

design review in 2019 to increase the agility 

of the organisation. During the review, each 

division re-examined their goals, identified 

key challenges, opportunities and capability 

requirements, and redesigned a more efficient 

organisational structure that will better deliver 

customer satisfaction and adapt to the ever-

changing business landscape.

Supply Chain Infrastructure

Supply chain is an integral part of SIAEC’s 

operations. Various initiatives have been 

rolled out to increase efficiencies in different 

aspects of the supply chain to better support 

operations.

Pneumatic Tube System

Through automation, we have increased the 

efficiency of delivering parts from our warehouse 

to the operational areas. The Pneumatic Tube 

System (PTS) is a network of tubes and receiving 

stations that transports small-sized parts (up 

to 5kg) in capsules between our warehouse, 

hangars and workshops. The PTS reduces the 

average delivery time from 90 minutes to just 

five minutes. 

Case Studies

Dispensing Solution

We have installed parts dispensing machines 

to facilitate the issuance of fast-moving 

expendables such as fasteners, which reduce 

the time taken for our staff to draw out parts. In 

addition, the system reduces the time required 

for stock-taking by an average of six hours each 

week.

Machine Vision

Through the use of video and image 

analytics, machine vision initiatives aim 

to improve the productivity of inspection 

tasks and enhance the safety, security 

and quality surveillance of operational 

activities.

SIAEC is working with OEMs and 

research institutes to explore solutions to 

automate the visual inspection process, 

which will enhance work quality as well 

as reduce the time taken to perform the 

inspections. Potential solutions include 

the use of drones which may reduce 

inspection times by up to 50%.

Innovative Culture

Aviation is a fast-changing industry and 

having an innovative culture is crucial to 

SIAEC’s success. We encourage ideas 

from employees to continually improve 

our processes.

Video Analytics Test Bed at Hangar 3

A test bed has been set up at Hangar 3 to explore 

the implementation of video analytics. Through 

this project, our operational and security teams 

will have access to real-time visualisations of 

the hangar operations and receive alerts of any 

quality, safety or security infringements. Other 

functions include geofencing for housekeeping, 

driving speed monitoring and heatmapping of 

the hangar floor. 

SIAEC Innovation Week 2019

Innovation Week is an annual event organised 

by the Innovation Group to showcase the 

Innovation initiatives of the Company. The event 

serves as an avenue to encourage suggestions 

for new projects and to nurture an innovative 

culture amongst our staff. More than 2,000 staff 

attended the week-long event held from 23 to 

26 July 2019. 

In line with this year’s theme of ‘Building an 

Innovative 

Culture’, 

several 

staff-initiated 

projects were displayed at the event. The staff 

who were involved in the projects also shared 

their experiences to inspire others to come forth 

with more innovative ideas. Innovative “Made in 

SIAEC” projects were showcased with exhibits 

from our industry partners featuring technology 

such as robotics, video analytics, virtual/mixed 

reality, simulation-based training and advanced 

tooling for aircraft maintenance tasks. Speakers 

from Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Thales, SIMTech and 

SAFRAN were also invited to give insights into 

technological developments in the aviation 

industry.

Our Safety Priorities: Aviation Safety and Workplace Safety

Aviation Safety

There is no compromise on safety. We 

uphold the highest standards of quality 

and safety in aircraft maintenance to 

ensure that our customers’ aircraft are 

airworthy and safe for flight. 

Operating in a highly regulated industry, 

we are subject to regular audits by 

airworthiness authorities and airline 

customers in adherence to mandated 

standards of safety and quality. 

SIAEC holds certifications from 25 

national 

airworthiness 

authorities 

worldwide and in Singapore. We passed 

all 92 audits by the authorities and 140 

audits by airline customers in FY2019/20.

Workplace Safety

The Company values every staff and 

their safety is of utmost importance 

to the Company. We want to ensure 

our staff return safely to their families. 

Furthermore, 

any 

staff 

injury 

will 

adversely affect our productivity and 

staff morale. As such, we strive towards 

zero safety incidents. 

Safety is an essential focus in all our 

operations. We instil and promote 

safety consciousness among our staff 

to prevent accidents and injuries. We 

continually review our practices and 

processes, and implement initiatives and 

technologies to enhance safety and to 

facilitate operations. This is especially 

important 

as 

Singapore 

faces 

the 

challenge of an ageing population and 

workforce.

Feedback

Besides 

the 

Company 

whistle-

blowing programme, there is an 

additional hotline for the confidential 

reporting of quality or safety concerns 

by employees. Reports are followed 

up promptly to ensure that the issues 

are adequately resolved.

Performance Dialogue 

The performance dialogue framework 

consists of a cascade of metrics and 

targets across all levels. Supervisory 

staff monitor these metrics and 

engage their teams to discuss the 

section’s performance covering areas 

such as cost, manpower and delivery, 

with emphasis on quality and safety. 

The 

daily 

engagements 

provide 

staff with the visibility of progress 

in addressing their feedback on 

operational issues. 

Highlights

Maintenance Line Operations Safety 

Assessment 

The Company spares no effort in enhancing 

its safety performance. During the year, a new 

programme, Maintenance Line Operations 

Safety Assessment (M-LOSA) was introduced. 

The programme adopts a non-punitive and 

proactive approach to identify threats and 

errors, and address issues before incidents 

occur. Experienced staff volunteer to observe 

their peers at work to identify good and poor 

practices. The observations are subsequently 

analysed with follow-up action plans formulated 

to improve safety. 

Safety Promotion Centre

As part of the Company’s commitment towards 

safety, the Safety Promotion Centre was 

launched in October 2019 to further raise the 

awareness of aviation safety. 

The Centre highlights lessons learnt from 

past aviation incidents that were related to 

maintenance. 

Through 

immersive 

audio 

and visual media, informational displays and 

interactive activities, the Centre aims to inculcate 

a safety-oriented mindset in all employees. All 

employees are required to attend an instructor-

led training at the Centre.

Through 

collaboration 

with 

industry 

stakeholders, the Safety Promotion Centre 

aspires to be a Centre of Excellence in safety for 

the aviation industry.

o country is immune to climate change. We believe that SIAEC 

needs to play its part to protect the environment even though our 

operations, unlike heavy industries, do not produce significant carbon 

emissions or consume large amount of electricity and water.

Electricity is the biggest utility of SIAEC’s operations. We are committed 

to managing our energy consumption by reducing wastage and shifting 

to renewable sources of electricity. This is in conjunction with our efforts 

to tackle carbon emissions—following Singapore’s Paris Agreement 

targets, the Company has set a target to achieve more than 24.48% 

reduction in our FY2013/14 carbon emissions intensity level by 2030. The 

Company’s Environmental Policy and Management System* articulates 

our commitment to high standards of environmental compliance, and 

facilitates our strict management of effluents and wastes.

Managing Energy Consumption

The Company’s main utility usage is the electricity used to support daily 

MRO activities in the hangars, workshops and offices. Any disruption to 

the electricity supply will jeopardise our operations. To minimise energy 

wastage, SIAEC implements proper energy management control. The 

Company is committed to monitoring and reducing the electricity 

consumption throughout the organisation in order to enhance long-term 

business competitiveness and to reduce our carbon footprint. 

An Energy Management Committee, comprising the Facilities Department 

and our building contractor, actively drives energy management 

programmes to control energy consumption and minimise wastage. 

Energy data is reviewed regularly and reported to Management. Any 

significant deviations will be identified, investigated and remedied. We also 

identify areas of high electricity consumption and formulate solutions to 

reduce usage. Our goal is to achieve a 15% reduction in our FY2013/14 

energy consumption level by FY2023/24.

 

To reduce our reliance on electricity generated from non-renewable 

sources, we have embarked on the installation of a solar photovoltaic 

system on the roofs of our hangars and the Engine Test Facility. The 

system is expected to generate 4,200 MWh of clean energy yearly, the 

equivalent of powering 940 HDB 4-room flats for a year, and will reduce 

our consumption of fossil fuel-generated electricity by approximately 20%. 

The system is targeted to be operational by the end of 2020.

Tackling Carbon Emissions

Singapore has taken a major step to protect our environment with the 

introduction of carbon tax in 2019. This sends a strong signal to the 

business community that corporations have an important role to play in 

the global efforts to combat climate change. 

We endeavour to regulate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our 

MRO operations. Emission levels are closely monitored to ensure that they 

are within the thresholds set by the authorities. 

Our vehicles undergo regular maintenance and inspections to minimise 

air pollution from vehicular emissions. We ensure that we comply with 

environmental regulations, including the smoke emissions and fuel usage 

restrictions by the Land Transport Authority and National Environment 

Agency. We aim to reduce our carbon emissions through initiatives that 

reduce our electricity consumption and use vehicles that meet low GHG 

emissions standards. As part of our shift towards more sustainable sources 

of energy, we are undertaking a feasibility study to replace our petrol and 

diesel-operated vehicles with electric vehicles, and embarking on a trial of 

using electric tow tractors in our operations.

Taking reference from Singapore’s target under the Paris Agreement to 

reduce GHG emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 level by 2030, we 

have set a long-term target to achieve more than 24.48% reduction in our 

FY2013/14 carbon emissions intensity level by 2030. 

The initiative to install a solar photovoltaic system on the roofs of our 

hangars and the Engine Test Facility to tap clean energy will reduce our 

carbon emissions by approximately 2,000 tonnes CO2e per year.

Environmental Policy and Management System

Our environmental policy articulates our commitment to maintaining 

high standards of environmental management in our operations 

and complying with environmental regulations. Our Environmental 

Management System, certified to the ISO 14001 standards since 

1998, sets out to minimise the negative environmental impact of our 

operations.

We maintain a stringent auditing system through internal inspections 

performed by the divisional Safety, Health and Environment 

Committees. To ensure continuous and effective operation of the 

Environmental Management System, a two-fold check system 

involving both internal and external audits is put in place. This ensures 

strict compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements.

Environmental impact is assessed at the start of the project, during 

the planning stage where the design, handling, storage and disposal 

of materials are considered. All proposed projects are discussed with 

the Management and approvals are sought before commencement of 

the projects. Once the projects are implemented, the data is collected 

and checked against the design data, and the results are reported to 

the Management.

Water Conservation 

We promote discipline in water usage. 

Our facilities maintenance team tracks 

the water consumption data and any 

unusual increase in water usage will be 

investigated and remedied. 

Rainwater is collected in tanks and is 

used for the flushing of toilets in three 

of our hangars. In 2020, the Company 

obtained the Water Efficient Building 

Certification from the Public Utilities 

Board 

for 

adopting 

water-efficient 

measures. 

We will continue to monitor our water 

consumption closely and implement 

water-saving measures.

Raising Environmental Awareness

Environmental 

awareness 

activities 

and 

upcycling workshops were conducted to raise 

staff awareness in reducing waste. We will 

continue to conduct these activities to educate 

staff on the importance of recycling and 

segregating the recyclables into the appropriate 

bins. Office staff were also given a set of stainless 

steel reusable cutlery and straws to reduce the 

use of single-use plastics during meals. 

Reducing Consumption of Paper

Several company-wide paperless initiatives 

have been implemented to reduce paper 

consumption, such as E-Tasks to digitise 

maintenance paperwork, issuance of e-letters to 

staff, online submission of hangar entry passes 

and petty cash claims, and medical claims via 

mobile applications. 

Through 

our 

digitalisation 

efforts 

and 

encouraging staff to practise the 3Rs, we have 

reduced our paper consumption over the years. 

For FY2019/20, we achieved a 14% reduction 

in our paper consumption compared to the 

year before, equivalent to saving 48 trees. We 

will continue to pursue digitalisation of other 

processes to further reduce our paper usage.

Waste Management 

Singapore generated 7.7 million tonnes of 

waste in 2018, equivalent to the volume 

of 15,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. 

Based on the current rate of waste 

generation, Singapore’s only landfill, the 

Semakau landfill, is expected to run out 

of space by 2035—a decade earlier than 

planned. To curb wastage, the Ministry 

of Environment and Water Resources 

designated 2019 as the Year Towards Zero 

Waste. With limited land for waste disposal 

and landfilling, we need to Reduce our 

waste, Reuse and Recycle (3Rs) resources.

In line with the national efforts in waste 

minimisation, the Company pays close 

attention to waste management and 

aims to reduce waste from our offices 

and operational activities. We have new 

and ongoing efforts to promote the 

3Rs. A recycling scheme is in place to 

recycle paper, cardboard, scrap metal 

and electronic waste from our offices 

and operational areas. Licensed recycling 

service providers are engaged to collect 

and ensure that our recyclable materials 

are processed properly.





Responsible Disposal 

The Company has put in place waste 

sorting and disposal processes as well as a 

contamination prevention process, which 

are managed by a licensed toxic industrial 

waste collector. 

These processes also regulate the disposal 

of toxic industrial waste and the storage, 

transportation and disposal of aircraft 

parts to minimise the environmental 

impact from our operations.

Trade Effluents Management 

As part of the Environmental Management 

System Policy in preventing pollution 

under ISO14001, SIAEC is focused on 

effluents management. The Company is 

committed to ensuring that the wastewater 

generated from our operations does not 

pollute our waters. Our hangar facilities 

are equipped with wastewater treatment 

plants to make wastewater safe for 

discharge into the public sewers. We are 

studying the feasibility of upgrading our 

wastewater treatment plants to expand 

the handling capability.  

Regular audits and inspections are carried 

out to ensure that the wastewater discharge 

and operation of wastewater treatment 

plants comply with relevant regulatory and 

ISO14001 requirements.

continuity plans to protect and minimise 

disruptions to operations, including 

making rapid adjustments to the Group’s 

operations in response to the evolving 

situation, (iii) taking actions to mitigate 

the adverse financial impact and to 

protect jobs, and (iv) working closely 

with our partners and customers to 

jointly overcome the challenges during 

this difficult period.  

We have taken prompt and appropriate 

measures that are aligned with the 

Ministry 

of 

Health’s 

advisories 

to 

safeguard our employee’s well-being, 

especially for the vulnerable staff (older, 

pregnant or with underlying medical 

conditions). 

 

With more staff telecommuting, the 

Group is mindful of the associated cyber 

security risks. Besides providing staff 

with the necessary IT support to work 

from home, appropriate cyber security 

measures have also been implemented 

to protect our IT systems. Regular 

reminders are sent to staff to maintain 

vigilance and adopt good information 

security practices against the risks of

We recognise the need to attract 

and retain the best talents to build a 

sustainable pool of licensed aircraft 

engineers, technicians and business 

leaders, and having a good training and 

development structure for their career 

progression and professional growth.  









A Competent Workforce

A strong technical workforce and innovative 

talents are pivotal to the Company’s success as 

a global MRO player. We firmly believe in actively 

spurring our staff to always perform to the best 

of their abilities.



Collaboration with Singapore Institute of 

Technology 

Under a collaboration with the Singapore 

Institute of Technology (SIT), SIAEC jointly 

delivers a three-year direct honours degree 

programme, leading to the Bachelor of 

Engineering with Honours in Aircraft Systems 

Engineering. The curriculum incorporates an 

intensive eight-month Integrated Work Study 

Programme (IWSP) at SIAEC. The programme 

is recognised by the Civil Aviation Authority of 

Singapore in fulfilling the requirement for a 

SAR-147 Approved Basic Course which would 

lead to the award of an Aircraft Maintenance 

Licence after further training with an MRO. 

Graduates from this programme will meet the 

growing needs of the aerospace and MRO 

industry in Singapore, as well as to fulfil our 

need for licensed aircraft engineers.

Singapore-Industry Scholarship 

Programme

2019 marks the eighth consecutive year that 

SIAEC has participated in the Singapore-

Industry 

Scholarship 

(SgIS) 

programme. 

The scholarship programme attracts the 

best talents with a passion to pursue a 

career in the MRO industry and to join our 

organisation. Established in 2012 by the 

Ministry of Education as a government-

industry partnership in talent development, 

scholarships are offered to Singapore citizens 

pursuing local and overseas undergraduate 

studies and who have demonstrated well-

rounded excellence at school. In FY2019/20,  

11 students were awarded scholarships under 

the scheme.    

Earn and Learn Programme

SIAEC has been appointed as the Programme 

Manager for the Aerospace Earn and Learn 

Programme (ELP). The programme is targeted 

at fresh graduates from the Polytechnics and 

ITE to encourage them to pursue a career in 

the aviation industry.  

SIAEC’s 12-month Aircraft Trainee Technician 

programme has been accredited under 

the ELP. We have also developed and 

delivered ELP-accredited Trainee Technician 

programmes for our JVs, Singapore Aero 

Engine Services Pte Ltd and Singapore Aero 

Support Services Pte Ltd respectively.

Work-Learn Technical Diploma

SIAEC and our wholly-owned subsidiary, 

Singapore Aero Support Services Pte Ltd, 

are collaborating with Temasek Polytechnic 

and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to 

develop a Work-Learn Technical Diploma 

(WLTD). The programme creates additional 

pathways for local graduates to explore 

careers in the aviation industry and develops 

a continuous pipeline of Cabin Trainee 

Technicians for SIAEC. Students undergo a 

structured programme at the institutes of 

higher learning and SIAEC, which culminates 

in a diploma. The programme at Temasek 

Polytechnic has commenced in 2019 while 

the programme at ITE will be launched in the 

second half of 2020.

Pathways in Technology Programme

SIAEC is proud to be one of the industry 

partners of IBM in its Pathways in Technology 

Programme (P-TECH), which aims to increase 

the pool of skilled talent to aid companies in 

their digital transformation efforts. Through 

the programme, ITE students will gain early 

exposure to career paths in the Information 

and 

Communication 

Technology 

(ICT) 

and 

Science, 

Technology, 

Engineering, 

Mathematics 

(STEM) 

disciplines, 

which 

will open doors for the students to pursue 

Polytechnic Diplomas or ITE WLTD in related 

sectors. 

The Company hosts innovation talks to 

showcase digital transformation in the MRO 

industry and conducts half-day programmes 

to impart soft skills such as self-management, 

time management and motivation to help 

the students appreciate the relevance of their 

coursework to the real-world applications of 

technology.

Partnership with Singapore University of 

Technology and Design

SIAEC is an industry partner with the Singapore 

University of Technology and Design (SUTD) 

on its Data and Business Analytics course. 

Through the collaboration, SUTD students 

have the opportunity to work with industries to 

apply their knowledge on data manipulation, 

data visualisation, data analysis, system 

modelling, revenue and cost estimation, 

financial ratio analysis, and business simulation. 

At the end of the semester, students will be 

able to showcase their projects with practical 

industry applications. 

We have embarked on several projects relating 

to 

manpower 

optimisation, 

equipment 

clustering and data dashboard with the SUTD 

students. With this partnership, we hope to 

attract more SUTD graduates to make SIAEC 

their employer of choice.

recurrent training curriculum is in place to 

ensure that all our staff remain up to date in 

their knowledge and skills. 

Company Training Committee

In September 2019, the Company signed 

a Memorandum of Agreement to form the 

Company Training Committee (CTC) with our 

unions. This is in support of the National Trades 

Union Congress’s goal to form CTCs with at 

least 1,000 companies to provide workers 

with training co-developed by unions, training 

providers and institutes of higher learning. The 

CTC provides a platform for the Company 

and unions to discuss matters relating to 

the training needs and programmes for our 

employees.

provide a forum for two-way feedback and 

to jointly set goals and expectations for the 

coming year. 

Beyond 

performance 

reviews, 

the 

Company has initiatives such as the 

Operational Excellence Framework, Gain-

Sharing Framework and the Star Employee 

Awards to recognise and reward good 

performance. 

Industrial Relations 

Good industrial relations is key to the 

continued success of the Company. The 

Company 

maintains 

cordial 

industrial 

relations by working closely with our union 

partners to ensure that our staff receive fair 

and sustainable wages and employment 

terms. We value our strong ties with our 

union partners, and are committed to 

working with the unions to resolve issues, 

seize business opportunities and meet new 

challenges.

Employee Health Benefits

The Company provides complimentary basic 

health screening for all staff annually. Our staff 

also enjoy subsidies from the Company for 

more comprehensive health check-ups every 

two years.

In line with the Singapore Government’s call 

for employers to implement portable medical 

benefits for their employees, the Company 

implemented the Portable Medical Benefits 

Scheme (PMBS) so that staff do not lose the 

inpatient and hospitalisation benefits even if they 

leave the organisation or workforce. PMBS also 

promotes early entry into appropriate medical 

coverage plans and encourages individual 

ownership of well-being.

Occupational Health Monitoring

We conduct regular reviews and surveillance 

inspections of the work environment as part of 

our ongoing effort to improve workplace safety 

and health. We monitor the occupational health 

of our staff by conducting relevant medical 

examinations such as audiometry examinations. 

Monthly Fruits Day

SIAEC promotes healthy food options through 

our monthly Fruits Day and providing vending 

machines that serve healthier food choices. 

Sports &amp; Recreation Committee

The Sports &amp; Recreation Committee (SRC) was 

founded to promote, organise and co-ordinate 

sports, social and other recreational activities for 

employees of the Company. Sports and social 

events that cater to staff’s interest, for example 

inter-divisional sports competitions and outdoor 

excursions, are organised regularly by the SRC as 

well as the SIA Group Sports Club.

Staff Welfare and Well-Being

A healthy workforce is crucial in 

supporting the Company’s growth and 

performance. We organise health talks 

and exercise activities regularly, and 

provide tips on healthy living in our 

inhouse magazine to encourage staff to 

pursue a healthy lifestyle. 

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

we have taken prompt and appropriate 

measures that are aligned with the 

Ministry 

of 

Health’s 

advisories 

to 

safeguard our employee’s well-being, 

especially for the vulnerable staff (older, 

pregnant or with underlying medical 

conditions). 

These include telecommuting for the 

majority of our support staff and reducing 

the number of operational staff onsite, 

regular communication on matters 

relating 

to 

COVID-19, 

temperature 

taking and health declarations, increased 

frequency of cleaning and provision of 

hand sanitisers at the common areas. For 

staff working onsite, team segregation, 

the 

use 

of 

appropriate 

personal 

protective equipment and other safe 

distancing measures are put in place to 

protect our employees.
